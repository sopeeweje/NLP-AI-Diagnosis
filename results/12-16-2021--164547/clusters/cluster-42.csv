"EX VIVO IMMUNOALTERATION OF PANCREAS ORGAN TRANSPLANTS Current methods of suppression of allograpft rejection in man employ a variety of agents that are immunologically nonspecific. Manipulation of an organ to reduce the  immunogenicity offers no risk to the transplant recipient and is a potential adjunct to nonspecific immunosuppression.  Recently ex vivo treatment of clinical bone marrow allografts with monoclonal antibodies has been successful in removing unwanted cells prior to transplantation.  The research proposed in this application an attempt to develop a model in which intact organs can be treated with selectivity toxic monoclonal antibodies targeted specifically for passenger leukocytes, including dendritic cells, within the graft.  Intact rat pancreases will be placed in an ex vivo normothermic, oxygenated hemoperfusion circuit and monoclonal reagents reactive with passenger leukocytes introduced into the blood perfusate.  The primary goal will be to develop optimal conditions for depletion of dendritic cells with monoclonal antibody perfusion, i.e., toxin coupling, in order to determine if the effect of this form of donor organ treatment is marked enough to be considered efficacious for clinical organ transplantation trials. The maximum effect that dendritic cell depletion alone can have on allograft survival in non-immunosuppressed rats will be assessed as will the possible synergism this form of ex-vivo graft immodulation may have with standard low dose immunosuppression of the recipient.  A second major aim will be to study the cellular and humoral recipient immune response to dendritic cell depleted rat pancreas allografts to determine the mechanism by which graft survival is prolonged, whether this is due primarily to reduced antigenicity of the graft or whether there is an active recipient regulatory response.  Finally, the general applicability of ex vivo perfusion of organs with selectivity toxic monoclonal antibodies will be investigated by applying the techniques developed with rat pancreas transplantation to other rat organ transplants (heart and kidney) as well as solid organ transplants (kidney) in the swine, an animal in which both the vascular endothelium the immune system more closely approximates that of the human.  The long-term goal of this laboratory is to develop treatment mechanisms for organ allografting which address the specific antigen disparity between donor and recipient rather than broad nonspecific suppression of the recipient's immune system.

"MOTTEP--PREVENTING THE NEED MOTTEP's efforts have been highly effective with the minority levels of donation currently (19992) at the level of their percentage in the population (25%). (See Table 3) Significantly more minorities around the country are becoming more aware of the causes of end-stage organ failure, the importance of organ/tissue donation, and are signing organ donor card. MOTTEP however, wants to expand its broad efforts because minorities continue to suffer disproportionately from end-stage renal disease and other illnesses which ultimately lead to the need for organ and tissue transplants. MOTTEP recognizes that minorities donating at their population level is far from enough. Minorities are 25% of the population, but greater than 40% of the number on transplant waiting lists and more than 50% on kidney transplant waiting lists. As a consequence of this minority donor recipient disparity, MOTTEP is soliciting financial for an additional five years from the year 2000 to 2005 to expand its successful national campaign. The specific aims of the proposed project are (1) to expand the scope of MOTTEP from 15 to 30 sites in 20 cities to reach more minorities around the country. Included among the probable new sites are: Louisville, KY; Baltimore, MD; Jackson, MS; Phoenix or Tucson, Ax; Tulsa, OK, (2) to broaden and deepen the knowledge of minorities, especially young people, about the value of organ/tissue donation and transplantation, (3) to increase the number of minoriti4es who become part of the national donor pool by signaling donor cards, having family discussions, and leaving organ behind after death, (4) to promote more healthy behaviors among minorities, especially young people, and thus in the long-run, reducing the need for organ/tissue transplantation, (5) to expand the capacity of local MOTTEP program activities by requiring full time rather than part time program coordinator positions (as is currently the case), and (6) to lower minority transplant waiting times by 10% within 5 years. As it has done in its previous projects, MOTTEP will use highly qualified subcontractors to evaluate this project on an annual basis. The contractor will use process, outcome, and impact evaluations to measure the impact MOTTEP's education and promotion campaign.

"A Program to Increase Living Donations in African Ameri*  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial disparities continue to exist in kidney transplantation despite the financial assurances provided by Medicare funding. African Americans make up more than 80% of the waiting list in South Carolina and receive half the cadaver kidneys procured. A major reason for this discrepancy is the poor organ donation rate in the African American community. Although living-donor transplantation offers the best therapeutic option for African American patients with end stage renal disease, only 13% of the transplanted kidneys in African Americans are from live donors. There are several recognized barriers to organ donation in the black community in the context of cadaver donation, but there is a paucity of information about live organ donation. Our overall hypothesis is that specific barriers to live organ donation in African American kidney transplant recipients and their families can be identified and overcome by an active intervention program and will lead to significantly improved live organ donation rates. A survey will first be conducted to identify specific barriers to live donor transplants in the African American community. Secondly, African American patients with end stage renal disease who are being evaluated for a kidney transplant will be randomized into a control or intervention group. African American patients and families in the control group will receive standard education provided by a non-minority member of the transplant team at the time of recipient evaluation. African American families randomized to the active intervention group (AIG) will receive the standard education from a minority nurse coordinator. An educator will ensure that content of information is uniform and is conveyed in a culturally sensitive manner. The AIG African American recipient and the family spokesperson will have additional educational sessions with the minority coordinator. Previous kidney recipient and donor African American families from the local community will meet with the recipients and families of the intervention group (AIG). Local volunteers from Area Health Education Consortium, National Kidney Foundation, Minority Pee Dee Health and Gift of Life Foundation will provide community support encouraging live organ donation. In addition to the educational interventions, AIG families identified as having significant financial hardships will be offered assistance such as travel vouchers and hotel coupons, child care support and possibly a one time reimbursement for loss of pay. It is expected that breaking down the barriers to live organ donation in the active intervention group will significantly increase donation rates. This will result in more number of African Americans receiving kidney transplants and improved graft and patient survival.

"African-American Study of Kidney Disease /Hypertension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hypertensive kidney disease commonly progresses. The primary objective of the AASK (African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension) Cohort Study is to determine prospectively the course of kidney function and risk factors for kidney disease progression in African-Americans with hypertensive kidney disease who receive recommended anti-hypertensive therapy. A secondary objective is to determine the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and assess its risk factors.      The AASK Cohort Study is a prospective, observational study that is an extension of the AASK trial. The AASK trial tested the effects on kidney function of 3 medications used as initial antihypertensive therapy (ramipril, metoprolol and amlodipine) and 2 levels of blood pressure control. Of the 1,094 trial participants, approximately 650 to 700 individuals who have not reached end stage renal disease (ESRD) will likely enroll in the Cohort Study. Risk factors to be studied include environmental, genetic, physiologic, and socio-economic variables. The primary renal outcome is a composite clinical outcome defined by doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. Medication treatment for hypertension, beginning with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, is offered to all participants. In this fashion, the study directly controls two of the major determinants of kidney disease progression (treatment of hypertension and use of reno-protective, antihypertensive medication). The minimum duration of follow-up in the Cohort Study is 5 years (total of 9 to 12 years, including the period of the AASK trial).

"Self-Care & Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Kidney loss in the first 10 years following transplantation remains a significant problem despite tremendous scientific advances in treating acute rejection and immunosuppression. This problem is pressing because racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities persist in kidney survival rates causing inequities in graft outcomes. One possible explanation for this survival difference is social inequities in self-care practices of compliance and symptom management. Self-care is essential to the survival of the kidney. But the resources (e.g., financial, social support) for self-care are not equitably distributed in the population. Under the new 2001 Medicare bill (HR 4577), only kidney recipients with disabilities obtain full support for as long as the new kidney functions, but most kidney recipients do not have disabilities, so financial support remains limited. This limitation can lead to the waste of scarce kidneys because it prevents patients from sustaining their kidneys after three years. Consequently, the capacity for and practice of self-care varies by race/ethnicity and insurance status.   The proposed interdisciplinary study will examine the social, cultural, and economic strategies and resources that kidney recipients mobilize to keep their kidneys healthy in the context of limited financial support from insurers. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) examine transplant recipients' health beliefs about kidney survival, compliance, and rejection; 2) investigate transplant recipients' practices of self-care and financially maintaining a kidney transplant; 3) measure the impact of recipients' health beliefs and self-care practices on graft outcomes; and 4) compare self-care practices and graft outcomes among kidney recipients with different demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds.   To accomplish these goals, the proposed four-year longitudinal study will use a multi-method approach for data collection. Data will be gathered prospectively through interviews with kidney recipients every six months and through medical chart review. Identifying the sociocultural and economic processes associated with better graft survival is important for: a) preventing kidney rejection, b) devising compliance interventions, c) preparing candidates for transplant through education, d) evaluating health policies designed to prevent financial barriers to kidney transplantation, and e) eliminating disparities in long-term kidney survival rates         ",Self-Care & Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients,6596289,K01DK063953,"['self care ', ' human subject ', ' immunosuppression ', ' interview ', ' kidney transplantation ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' belief ', ' socioeconomics ', ' culture ', ' therapy compliance ', ' transplant rejection ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' ']",NIDDK,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO,K01,2003,112621,0.1547035601355223

"Drew/RAND/UCLA Comprehensive Center fo Health Disparity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Healthy People 2010 recognizes chronic kidney disease (CKD) as one of 28 focus areas to improve the nation's health. To address these goals, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (Drew) is proposing to establish a Comprehensive Center on Health Disparities (CCHD) focusing on CKD. The foundation for the center will be a formalized partnership between Drew, UCLA and RAND. The Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD will bring important strengths to disparities-focused research. Los Angeles County is an ideal setting for this center, being one of the most diverse counties in the United States, and one with major population concentrations of disadvantaged minority groups disproportionately affected by high rates of CKD (and major CKD risk factors), related morbidity and mortality, as well as some of the lowest rates of educational attainment, income and health insurance coverage in the nation. The center will focus on contextual, community, and health care delivery factors as they relate to CKD disparities among the nation's minority and disadvantaged populations, using a bench to bedside approach that impacts relevant health care policy. The overall goals are to reduce the incidence of death related to CKD and improve the quality of life for those who have CKD. Drew and its partners propose to address these goals through the activities of four cores: 1) The Administrative and Scientific Core, 2) the Community Outreach and Information Dissemination (Community) Core, 3) the Chronic Kidney Disease Health Outcomes and Policy Core, and 4) the Developmental Core.   The Specific Aims of the Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD are to:   1) Promote the conduct of methodologically rigorous research (focusing on national CKD priority areas) aimed at improving outcomes for CKD patients;   2) Promote the conduct of methodologically rigorous research (focusing on national CKD priority areas)  aimed at reducing disparities in CKD and CKD risk factors for disadvantaged African American and Latino patients;   3) Build research capacity and provide both formal training in academic and community-based settings for CKD/health disparities researchers at Drew University;   4) Educate and increase the participation of medically underserved minorities in evidence-based health promotion and disease prevention research directed toward CKD and CKD risk factors; and   5) Disseminate results of relevant efficacy studies and health information in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner to this population, community-based health care providers, the broader academic community, and to health policy makers.

"MOTTEP--PREVENTING THE NEED MOTTEP's efforts have been highly effective with the minority levels of donation currently (19992) at the level of their percentage in the population (25%). (See Table 3) Significantly more minorities around the country are becoming more aware of the causes of end-stage organ failure, the importance of organ/tissue donation, and are signing organ donor card. MOTTEP however, wants to expand its broad efforts because minorities continue to suffer disproportionately from end-stage renal disease and other illnesses which ultimately lead to the need for organ and tissue transplants. MOTTEP recognizes that minorities donating at their population level is far from enough. Minorities are 25% of the population, but greater than 40% of the number on transplant waiting lists and more than 50% on kidney transplant waiting lists. As a consequence of this minority donor recipient disparity, MOTTEP is soliciting financial for an additional five years from the year 2000 to 2005 to expand its successful national campaign. The specific aims of the proposed project are (1) to expand the scope of MOTTEP from 15 to 30 sites in 20 cities to reach more minorities around the country. Included among the probable new sites are: Louisville, KY; Baltimore, MD; Jackson, MS; Phoenix or Tucson, Ax; Tulsa, OK, (2) to broaden and deepen the knowledge of minorities, especially young people, about the value of organ/tissue donation and transplantation, (3) to increase the number of minoriti4es who become part of the national donor pool by signaling donor cards, having family discussions, and leaving organ behind after death, (4) to promote more healthy behaviors among minorities, especially young people, and thus in the long-run, reducing the need for organ/tissue transplantation, (5) to expand the capacity of local MOTTEP program activities by requiring full time rather than part time program coordinator positions (as is currently the case), and (6) to lower minority transplant waiting times by 10% within 5 years. As it has done in its previous projects, MOTTEP will use highly qualified subcontractors to evaluate this project on an annual basis. The contractor will use process, outcome, and impact evaluations to measure the impact MOTTEP's education and promotion campaign.

"A Program to Increase Living Donations in African Ameri*  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial disparities continue to exist in kidney transplantation despite the financial assurances provided by Medicare funding. African Americans make up more than 80% of the waiting list in South Carolina and receive half the cadaver kidneys procured. A major reason for this discrepancy is the poor organ donation rate in the African American community. Although living-donor transplantation offers the best therapeutic option for African American patients with end stage renal disease, only 13% of the transplanted kidneys in African Americans are from live donors. There are several recognized barriers to organ donation in the black community in the context of cadaver donation, but there is a paucity of information about live organ donation. Our overall hypothesis is that specific barriers to live organ donation in African American kidney transplant recipients and their families can be identified and overcome by an active intervention program and will lead to significantly improved live organ donation rates. A survey will first be conducted to identify specific barriers to live donor transplants in the African American community. Secondly, African American patients with end stage renal disease who are being evaluated for a kidney transplant will be randomized into a control or intervention group. African American patients and families in the control group will receive standard education provided by a non-minority member of the transplant team at the time of recipient evaluation. African American families randomized to the active intervention group (AIG) will receive the standard education from a minority nurse coordinator. An educator will ensure that content of information is uniform and is conveyed in a culturally sensitive manner. The AIG African American recipient and the family spokesperson will have additional educational sessions with the minority coordinator. Previous kidney recipient and donor African American families from the local community will meet with the recipients and families of the intervention group (AIG). Local volunteers from Area Health Education Consortium, National Kidney Foundation, Minority Pee Dee Health and Gift of Life Foundation will provide community support encouraging live organ donation. In addition to the educational interventions, AIG families identified as having significant financial hardships will be offered assistance such as travel vouchers and hotel coupons, child care support and possibly a one time reimbursement for loss of pay. It is expected that breaking down the barriers to live organ donation in the active intervention group will significantly increase donation rates. This will result in more number of African Americans receiving kidney transplants and improved graft and patient survival.

"AASK Cohort Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hypertensive kidney disease commonly progresses. The primary objective of the AASK (African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension) Cohort Study is to determine prospectively the course of kidney function and risk factors for kidney disease progression in African-Americans with hypertensive kidney disease who receive recommended antihypertensive therapy. A secondary objective is to determine the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and assess its risk factors.   The AASK Cohort Study is a prospective, observational study that is an extension of the AASK trial. The AASK trial tested the effects on kidney function of 3 medications used as initial antihypertensive therapy (ramipril, metoprolol and amlodipine) and 2 levels of blood pressure control. Of the 1,094 trial participants, approximately 650 to 700 individuals who have not reached end stage renal disease (ESRD) will likely enroll in the Cohort Study. Risk factors to be studied include environmental, genetic, physiologic, and socio-economic variables. The primary renal outcome is a composite clinical outcome defined by doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. Medication treatment for hypertension, beginning with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, is offered to all participants. In this fashion, the study directly controls two of the major determinants of kidney disease progression (treatment of hypertension and use of reno-protective, antihypertensive medication). The minimum duration of follow-up in the Cohort Study is 5 years (total of 9 to 12 years, including the period of the AASK trial). At the Hopkins Center, we plan to enroll 54 participants, 44 participants who will be active participants and eligible for all protocol measurements, and 10 participants who have reached end-stage renal disease who will consent for DNA sampling and follow-up. Achieving complete participant enrollment and retention during the cohort study are important goals of the Hopkins clinical center.

"Self-Care & Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Kidney loss in the first 10 years following transplantation remains a significant problem despite tremendous scientific advances in treating acute rejection and immunosuppression. This problem is pressing because racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities persist in kidney survival rates causing inequities in graft outcomes. One possible explanation for this survival difference is social inequities in self-care practices of compliance and symptom management. Self-care is essential to the survival of the kidney. But the resources (e.g., financial, social support) for self-care are not equitably distributed in the population. Under the new 2001 Medicare bill (HR 4577), only kidney recipients with disabilities obtain full support for as long as the new kidney functions, but most kidney recipients do not have disabilities, so financial support remains limited. This limitation can lead to the waste of scarce kidneys because it prevents patients from sustaining their kidneys after three years. Consequently, the capacity for and practice of self-care varies by race/ethnicity and insurance status.   The proposed interdisciplinary study will examine the social, cultural, and economic strategies and resources that kidney recipients mobilize to keep their kidneys healthy in the context of limited financial support from insurers. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) examine transplant recipients' health beliefs about kidney survival, compliance, and rejection; 2) investigate transplant recipients' practices of self-care and financially maintaining a kidney transplant; 3) measure the impact of recipients' health beliefs and self-care practices on graft outcomes; and 4) compare self-care practices and graft outcomes among kidney recipients with different demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds.   To accomplish these goals, the proposed four-year longitudinal study will use a multi-method approach for data collection. Data will be gathered prospectively through interviews with kidney recipients every six months and through medical chart review. Identifying the sociocultural and economic processes associated with better graft survival is important for: a) preventing kidney rejection, b) devising compliance interventions, c) preparing candidates for transplant through education, d) evaluating health policies designed to prevent financial barriers to kidney transplantation, and e) eliminating disparities in long-term kidney survival rates         ",Self-Care & Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients,6804615,K01DK063953,"['self care ', ' human subject ', ' immunosuppression ', ' interview ', ' kidney transplantation ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' belief ', ' socioeconomics ', ' culture ', ' therapy compliance ', ' transplant rejection ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' ']",NIDDK,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO,K01,2004,115296,0.1547035601355223
"MOTTEP--PREVENTING THE NEED MOTTEP's efforts have been highly effective with the minority levels of donation currently (19992) at the level of their percentage in the population (25%). (See Table 3) Significantly more minorities around the country are becoming more aware of the causes of end-stage organ failure, the importance of organ/tissue donation, and are signing organ donor card. MOTTEP however, wants to expand its broad efforts because minorities continue to suffer disproportionately from end-stage renal disease and other illnesses which ultimately lead to the need for organ and tissue transplants. MOTTEP recognizes that minorities donating at their population level is far from enough. Minorities are 25% of the population, but greater than 40% of the number on transplant waiting lists and more than 50% on kidney transplant waiting lists. As a consequence of this minority donor recipient disparity, MOTTEP is soliciting financial for an additional five years from the year 2000 to 2005 to expand its successful national campaign. The specific aims of the proposed project are (1) to expand the scope of MOTTEP from 15 to 30 sites in 20 cities to reach more minorities around the country. Included among the probable new sites are: Louisville, KY; Baltimore, MD; Jackson, MS; Phoenix or Tucson, Ax; Tulsa, OK, (2) to broaden and deepen the knowledge of minorities, especially young people, about the value of organ/tissue donation and transplantation, (3) to increase the number of minoriti4es who become part of the national donor pool by signaling donor cards, having family discussions, and leaving organ behind after death, (4) to promote more healthy behaviors among minorities, especially young people, and thus in the long-run, reducing the need for organ/tissue transplantation, (5) to expand the capacity of local MOTTEP program activities by requiring full time rather than part time program coordinator positions (as is currently the case), and (6) to lower minority transplant waiting times by 10% within 5 years. As it has done in its previous projects, MOTTEP will use highly qualified subcontractors to evaluate this project on an annual basis. The contractor will use process, outcome, and impact evaluations to measure the impact MOTTEP's education and promotion campaign.

"Drew/RAND/UCLA Comprehensive Center fo Health Disparity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Healthy People 2010 recognizes chronic kidney disease (CKD) as one of 28 focus areas to improve the nation's health. To address these goals, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (Drew) is proposing to establish a Comprehensive Center on Health Disparities (CCHD) focusing on CKD. The foundation for the center will be a formalized partnership between Drew, UCLA and RAND. The Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD will bring important strengths to disparities-focused research. Los Angeles County is an ideal setting for this center, being one of the most diverse counties in the United States, and one with major population concentrations of disadvantaged minority groups disproportionately affected by high rates of CKD (and major CKD risk factors), related morbidity and mortality, as well as some of the lowest rates of educational attainment, income and health insurance coverage in the nation. The center will focus on contextual, community, and health care delivery factors as they relate to CKD disparities among the nation's minority and disadvantaged populations, using a bench to bedside approach that impacts relevant health care policy. The overall goals are to reduce the incidence of death related to CKD and improve the quality of life for those who have CKD. Drew and its partners propose to address these goals through the activities of four cores: 1) The Administrative and Scientific Core, 2) the Community Outreach and Information Dissemination (Community) Core, 3) the Chronic Kidney Disease Health Outcomes and Policy Core, and 4) the Developmental Core.

"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   According to the 2002 U.S. Census, Hispanics are now the nation's largest minority group. There has also been a dramatic rise in the Hispanic end stage renal disease (ESRD) population, with the number of Hispanics on dialysis increasing by more than 70 percent between 1996 and 2001. Further growth of the Hispanic ESRD population is expected in view of the increasing size of the overall Hispanic population, a high prevalence of diabetes, and an increased incidence of ESRD in Hispanics. Despite the magnitude of this problem, little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is one of seven clinical centers for the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, which is an NIH-sponsored multi-centered study investigating risk factors for progression of kidney and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 3,000 participants with CKD. The CRIC Study cohort is 50 percent White and 50 percent Black. This application seeks to establish a sizable cohort of Hispanics with CKD that will be integrated into the overall CRIC Study. The overall aims of this application are:   1. To determine predictors of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKD.   2. To compare rates of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKD with those seen in non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks.   3. To improve the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) prediction equations in Hispanics with CKD.   To achieve these aims, we will recruit and retain 316 Hispanic participants with CKD at UIC to undergo annual visits for relevant exposures (demographics, medical history, medications, diet, cognitive function, and quality of life) and measurements of subclinical CVD and renal function. To test hypotheses of particular importance to Hispanics, this proposal will focus on issues related to visceral adiposity, inflammation, and health care disparities. The linkage of the proposed study to the CRIC Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore risk factors and mechanisms for CKD and CVD progression in Hispanics, which are problems of critical importance from both scientific and public health perspectives.

"MOTTEP--PREVENTING THE NEED MOTTEP's efforts have been highly effective with the minority levels of donation currently (19992) at the level of their percentage in the population (25%). (See Table 3) Significantly more minorities around the country are becoming more aware of the causes of end-stage organ failure, the importance of organ/tissue donation, and are signing organ donor card. MOTTEP however, wants to expand its broad efforts because minorities continue to suffer disproportionately from end-stage renal disease and other illnesses which ultimately lead to the need for organ and tissue transplants. MOTTEP recognizes that minorities donating at their population level is far from enough. Minorities are 25% of the population, but greater than 40% of the number on transplant waiting lists and more than 50% on kidney transplant waiting lists. As a consequence of this minority donor recipient disparity, MOTTEP is soliciting financial for an additional five years from the year 2000 to 2005 to expand its successful national campaign. The specific aims of the proposed project are (1) to expand the scope of MOTTEP from 15 to 30 sites in 20 cities to reach more minorities around the country. Included among the probable new sites are: Louisville, KY; Baltimore, MD; Jackson, MS; Phoenix or Tucson, Ax; Tulsa, OK, (2) to broaden and deepen the knowledge of minorities, especially young people, about the value of organ/tissue donation and transplantation, (3) to increase the number of minoriti4es who become part of the national donor pool by signaling donor cards, having family discussions, and leaving organ behind after death, (4) to promote more healthy behaviors among minorities, especially young people, and thus in the long-run, reducing the need for organ/tissue transplantation, (5) to expand the capacity of local MOTTEP program activities by requiring full time rather than part time program coordinator positions (as is currently the case), and (6) to lower minority transplant waiting times by 10% within 5 years. As it has done in its previous projects, MOTTEP will use highly qualified subcontractors to evaluate this project on an annual basis. The contractor will use process, outcome, and impact evaluations to measure the impact MOTTEP's education and promotion campaign.

"A Program to Increase Living Donations in African Ameri*  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial disparities continue to exist in kidney transplantation despite the financial assurances provided by Medicare funding. African Americans make up more than 80% of the waiting list in South Carolina and receive half the cadaver kidneys procured. A major reason for this discrepancy is the poor organ donation rate in the African American community. Although living-donor transplantation offers the best therapeutic option for African American patients with end stage renal disease, only 13% of the transplanted kidneys in African Americans are from live donors. There are several recognized barriers to organ donation in the black community in the context of cadaver donation, but there is a paucity of information about live organ donation. Our overall hypothesis is that specific barriers to live organ donation in African American kidney transplant recipients and their families can be identified and overcome by an active intervention program and will lead to significantly improved live organ donation rates. A survey will first be conducted to identify specific barriers to live donor transplants in the African American community. Secondly, African American patients with end stage renal disease who are being evaluated for a kidney transplant will be randomized into a control or intervention group. African American patients and families in the control group will receive standard education provided by a non-minority member of the transplant team at the time of recipient evaluation. African American families randomized to the active intervention group (AIG) will receive the standard education from a minority nurse coordinator. An educator will ensure that content of information is uniform and is conveyed in a culturally sensitive manner. The AIG African American recipient and the family spokesperson will have additional educational sessions with the minority coordinator. Previous kidney recipient and donor African American families from the local community will meet with the recipients and families of the intervention group (AIG). Local volunteers from Area Health Education Consortium, National Kidney Foundation, Minority Pee Dee Health and Gift of Life Foundation will provide community support encouraging live organ donation. In addition to the educational interventions, AIG families identified as having significant financial hardships will be offered assistance such as travel vouchers and hotel coupons, child care support and possibly a one time reimbursement for loss of pay. It is expected that breaking down the barriers to live organ donation in the active intervention group will significantly increase donation rates. This will result in more number of African Americans receiving kidney transplants and improved graft and patient survival.

He is seeking renewal of this Mid-career Award in Patient-oriented Research to enhance his efforts in clinical research in kidney disease and to continue to build the training program in kidney disease research. Dr. Powe has conducted several clinical investigations in nephrology including studies of: etiology (racial disparities in occurrence of ESRD and a randomized clinical trial of low-versus highosmolality contrast media-induced nephrotoxicity); diagnosis (comparison of physical examination with color flow doppler for detection of vascular access failure); therapy (effectiveness of recombinant human erythropoietin for treatment of anemia of ESRD); and prognosis (incidence, risk factors and prognosis of septicemia and comorbid cardiovascular disease in ESRD patients); and determinants of health disparities. Dr. Powe directs the Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for ESRD (CHOICE) study. This is a national prospective cohort study comparing treatment and outcomes in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. The study has 1041 patients enrolled, making it one of the largest and most representative prospective cohorts of dialysis patients ever studied in the U.S. Data on medical history, laboratory studies, comorbidity and severity of disease and clinical outcomes are being collected. The study has also established a specimen bank which provides opportunities for examining mechanisms for the consequences of kidney disease or its treatment. Ethnic minorities make up a disproportionate share of the population with ESRD. Dr. Powe would like to extend his work into understanding the biologic, clinical and behavioral determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease. Dr. Powe has mentored a cadre of trainees and junior faculty in clinical research in kidney disease.

"Drew/RAND/UCLA Comprehensive Center fo Health Disparity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Healthy People 2010 recognizes chronic kidney disease (CKD) as one of 28 focus areas to improve the nation's health. To address these goals, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (Drew) is proposing to establish a Comprehensive Center on Health Disparities (CCHD) focusing on CKD. The foundation for the center will be a formalized partnership between Drew, UCLA and RAND. The Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD will bring important strengths to disparities-focused research. Los Angeles County is an ideal setting for this center, being one of the most diverse counties in the United States, and one with major population concentrations of disadvantaged minority groups disproportionately affected by high rates of CKD (and major CKD risk factors), related morbidity and mortality, as well as some of the lowest rates of educational attainment, income and health insurance coverage in the nation. The center will focus on contextual, community, and health care delivery factors as they relate to CKD disparities among the nation's minority and disadvantaged populations, using a bench to bedside approach that impacts relevant health care policy. The overall goals are to reduce the incidence of death related to CKD and improve the quality of life for those who have CKD. Drew and its partners propose to address these goals through the activities of four cores: 1) The Administrative and Scientific Core, 2) the Community Outreach and Information Dissemination (Community) Core, 3) the Chronic Kidney Disease Health Outcomes and Policy Core, and 4) the Developmental Core.   The Specific Aims of the Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD are to:   1) Promote the conduct of methodologically rigorous research (focusing on national CKD priority areas) aimed at improving outcomes for CKD patients;   2) Promote the conduct of methodologically rigorous research (focusing on national CKD priority areas)  aimed at reducing disparities in CKD and CKD risk factors for disadvantaged African American and Latino patients;   3) Build research capacity and provide both formal training in academic and community-based settings for CKD/health disparities researchers at Drew University;   4) Educate and increase the participation of medically underserved minorities in evidence-based health promotion and disease prevention research directed toward CKD and CKD risk factors; and   5) Disseminate results of relevant efficacy studies and health information in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner to this population, community-based health care providers, the broader academic community, and to health policy makers.

"Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. L. Ebony Boulware is a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who recently trained in Internal Medicine at University of Maryland Medical Center and completed a fellowship in General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins. She seeks this Mentored Clinical Scientist Award to study why the health burden of CKD is magnified among ethnic/racial minorities. Ethnic/racial disparities in the incidence and prevalence of CKD are striking, with African Americans suffering rates of CKD 4 to 6 times greater than their White counterparts. While some of the excess incidence of ESRD in high-risk populations can be explained by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, much of the excess risk of progression toward ESRD for ethnic minorities remains unexplained.   Building on research experience and skills attained during her fellowship, Dr. Boulware aims to assess potential attitudinal, behavioral, and clinical mechanisms (awareness and perceived susceptibility to disease, adherence, trust and perceived discrimination, patient-physician communication) through which previously unexplained ethnic/racial disparities in CKD could be explained. She will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of participants in a multi-center study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), high-risk African Americans (Jackson Heart Study), and high-risk patients in urban clinical settings (collecting data in her proposed ancillary study to an ongoing NIH/NHLBI-funded randomized controlled trial of persons with hypertension and diabetes in Maryland). Data include medical history, behavioral measures, physical examination measures, and laboratory studies. Analytic methods will include logistic regression, survival analysis, analysis of clustered data, and other longitudinal data analysis techniques.    In addition to experience in the conduct of these studies, Dr. Boulware will enhance her research knowledge and skills through advanced coursework, research team meetings, conferences, and seminars in the supportive and multidisciplinary environment of the Welch Center. This award will provide Dr. Boulware with a foundation to launch her independent research career devoted to understanding the reasons behind ethnic/racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, and in reducing ethnic/racial disparities in CKD.       ",Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities,7144383,K23DK070757,"['disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' chronic disease /disorder ', ' pathologic process ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' human subject ', ' kidney disorder ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human morbidity ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' prejudice ', ' behavior prediction ', ' perception ', ' ethnic group ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' quality of life ', ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2006,134730,0.10809088394564534
"A Program to Increase Living Donations in African Ameri*  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial disparities continue to exist in kidney transplantation despite the financial assurances provided by Medicare funding. African Americans make up more than 80% of the waiting list in South Carolina and receive half the cadaver kidneys procured. A major reason for this discrepancy is the poor organ donation rate in the African American community. Although living-donor transplantation offers the best therapeutic option for African American patients with end stage renal disease, only 13% of the transplanted kidneys in African Americans are from live donors. There are several recognized barriers to organ donation in the black community in the context of cadaver donation, but there is a paucity of information about live organ donation. Our overall hypothesis is that specific barriers to live organ donation in African American kidney transplant recipients and their families can be identified and overcome by an active intervention program and will lead to significantly improved live organ donation rates. A survey will first be conducted to identify specific barriers to live donor transplants in the African American community. Secondly, African American patients with end stage renal disease who are being evaluated for a kidney transplant will be randomized into a control or intervention group. African American patients and families in the control group will receive standard education provided by a non-minority member of the transplant team at the time of recipient evaluation. African American families randomized to the active intervention group (AIG) will receive the standard education from a minority nurse coordinator. An educator will ensure that content of information is uniform and is conveyed in a culturally sensitive manner. The AIG African American recipient and the family spokesperson will have additional educational sessions with the minority coordinator. Previous kidney recipient and donor African American families from the local community will meet with the recipients and families of the intervention group (AIG). Local volunteers from Area Health Education Consortium, National Kidney Foundation, Minority Pee Dee Health and Gift of Life Foundation will provide community support encouraging live organ donation. In addition to the educational interventions, AIG families identified as having significant financial hardships will be offered assistance such as travel vouchers and hotel coupons, child care support and possibly a one time reimbursement for loss of pay. It is expected that breaking down the barriers to live organ donation in the active intervention group will significantly increase donation rates. This will result in more number of African Americans receiving kidney transplants and improved graft and patient survival.

"Self-Care & Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Kidney loss in the first 10 years following transplantation remains a significant problem despite tremendous scientific advances in treating acute rejection and immunosuppression. This problem is pressing because racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities persist in kidney survival rates causing inequities in graft outcomes. One possible explanation for this survival difference is social inequities in self-care practices of compliance and symptom management. Self-care is essential to the survival of the kidney. But the resources (e.g., financial, social support) for self-care are not equitably distributed in the population. Under the new 2001 Medicare bill (HR 4577), only kidney recipients with disabilities obtain full support for as long as the new kidney functions, but most kidney recipients do not have disabilities, so financial support remains limited. This limitation can lead to the waste of scarce kidneys because it prevents patients from sustaining their kidneys after three years. Consequently, the capacity for and practice of self-care varies by race/ethnicity and insurance status.   The proposed interdisciplinary study will examine the social, cultural, and economic strategies and resources that kidney recipients mobilize to keep their kidneys healthy in the context of limited financial support from insurers. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) examine transplant recipients' health beliefs about kidney survival, compliance, and rejection; 2) investigate transplant recipients' practices of self-care and financially maintaining a kidney transplant; 3) measure the impact of recipients' health beliefs and self-care practices on graft outcomes; and 4) compare self-care practices and graft outcomes among kidney recipients with different demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds.   To accomplish these goals, the proposed four-year longitudinal study will use a multi-method approach for data collection. Data will be gathered prospectively through interviews with kidney recipients every six months and through medical chart review. Identifying the sociocultural and economic processes associated with better graft survival is important for: a) preventing kidney rejection, b) devising compliance interventions, c) preparing candidates for transplant through education, d) evaluating health policies designed to prevent financial barriers to kidney transplantation, and e) eliminating disparities in long-term kidney survival rates         ",Self-Care & Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients,7303293,K01DK063953,"['self care ', ' human subject ', ' immunosuppression ', ' interview ', ' kidney transplantation ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' belief ', ' socioeconomics ', ' culture ', ' therapy compliance ', ' transplant rejection ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' ']",NIDDK,ALBANY MEDICAL COLLEGE,K01,2006,119964,0.1547035601355223

"Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is a request for a Mentored Career Award for Faculty at Minority Institutions that will allow the candidate to develop a long-term research program concerned with the relationship between socio- economic distress (SED) associated with disadvantaged minority group membership and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The primary goal of this research project is to develop and elaborate a model specifying how distressing social and economic environments are associated with psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that impact the prevalence of CKD among African Americans. This project proposal outlines a plan of career development and intensive research activities that will leverage already completed doctoral level research and training in the social sciences. Substantive courses in addition to intense topical workshops and seminars will provide a structured means to strengthen five core competencies (i. e., epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, leadership, and scientific presentation) that are necessary to establish a program of research investigating how non-traditional, non-biomedical factors and traditional biomedical risk factors independently and collectively impact CKD among an at-risk population. The research proposed in this application has three specific aims. The proposed project will: 1) examine the extent to which socio-economic distress or SED is associated with CKD among African Americans: 2) assess the degree to which potentially mediating mechanisms are independently and collectively associated with CKD among African Americans; and 3) determine the extent to which the relationship between SED and CKD is mediated by psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical factors. The models associated with each aim will be assessed through an innovative analysis of data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). The JHS is a longitudinal, population-based study of CVD and related risk factors among African Americans in Mississippi - the state with the worst health profile in the nation. The resources at Meharry Medical College, Vanderbilt University, and the JHS provide a unique setting for a five year program of mentored research, education, and training that will build on the candidate's background in the social sciences to produce cutting-edge epidemiological research focusing on health disparities, CKD, and CVD. This research will incorporate information about the context in which African Americans live and work into empirical models specifying how non-traditional (as well as traditional) biomedical risk factors impact health outcomes; thereby informing health policy's effort to address and eliminate CKD and CVD disparities.           ",Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study,7268320,K01HL088735,"['Disadvantaged ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Heart ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Distress ', ' Leadership ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Research Activity ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patients ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United Nations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' Equation ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Training and Education ', ' social model ', ' Structure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Abbreviations ', ' social ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' ']",NHLBI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,K01,2007,124589,0.0862006873106904
"Engaging Communities and Institutions to Reduce Health Disparities in Cleveland    DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Cleveland is characterized by an extremely high poverty rate, substantial numbers of racial/ethnic minorities, and marked health disparities. We propose to engage Cleveland's health care providers, educational institutions, community organizations, and government agencies to understand and reduce health disparities.  To take advantage of pre-existing community and institutional strengths, we will focus initially on 3 interrelated prototypical conditions: hypertension, kidney disease, and transplantation. These conditions affect many individuals and have some of the most striking health disparities observed in the United States.      The Research Core includes projects that involve (a) utilizing lay health advisors to help patients address the social contextual factors that act as barriers to hypertension management, (b) utilizing interpreters as advocates for Spanish speaking patients with hypertension or kidney disease, and (c) utilizing transplant recipients as navigators to improve access to kidney transplantation. The Research Training/Education Core involves (a) recruiting students, particularly from minority backgrounds, into undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral programs related to health disparities, (b) providing diverse educational opportunities relevant to health disparities research, and (c) supporting postdoctoral students and junior faculty, particularly from underrepresented groups, to ensure successful entry into academic positions. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core involves a community-based video intervention to enhance signing of organ donor cards. The Administrative Core will coordinate and foster interactions across projects/cores, provide shared resources and personnel, assist in other community efforts to address disparities, lead interactions with other NCMHD Research Centers of Excellence, disseminate findings, and develop future initiatives. Each of the three research projects as well as the Community Engagement/Outreach Core focus on testing interventions to reduce health disparities. Moreover, the design of these interventions is informed by an understanding of the mechanisms that created health disparities in each of the areas studied.

"Drew/RAND/UCLA Comprehensive Center on Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Healthy People 2010 recognizes chronic kidney disease (CKD) as one of 28 focus areas to improve the nation's health. To address these goals, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (Drew) is proposing to establish a Comprehensive Center on Health Disparities (CCHD) focusing on CKD. The foundation for the center will be a formalized partnership between Drew, UCLA and RAND. The Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD will bring important strengths to disparities-focused research. Los Angeles County is an ideal setting for this center, being one of the most diverse counties in the United States, and one with major population concentrations of disadvantaged minority groups disproportionately affected by high rates of CKD (and major CKD risk factors), related morbidity and mortality, as well as some of the lowest rates of educational attainment, income and health insurance coverage in the nation. The center will focus on contextual, community, and health care delivery factors as they relate to CKD disparities among the nation's minority and disadvantaged populations, using a bench to bedside approach that impacts relevant health care policy. The overall goals are to reduce the incidence of death related to CKD and improve the quality of life for those who have CKD. Drew and its partners propose to address these goals through the activities of four cores: 1) The Administrative and Scientific Core, 2) the Community Outreach and Information Dissemination (Community) Core, 3) the Chronic Kidney Disease Health Outcomes and Policy Core, and 4) the Developmental Core.   The Specific Aims of the Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD are to:   1) Promote the conduct of methodologically rigorous research (focusing on national CKD priority areas) aimed at improving outcomes for CKD patients;   2) Promote the conduct of methodologically rigorous research (focusing on national CKD priority areas)  aimed at reducing disparities in CKD and CKD risk factors for disadvantaged African American and Latino patients;   3) Build research capacity and provide both formal training in academic and community-based settings for CKD/health disparities researchers at Drew University;   4) Educate and increase the participation of medically underserved minorities in evidence-based health promotion and disease prevention research directed toward CKD and CKD risk factors; and   5) Disseminate results of relevant efficacy studies and health information in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner to this population, community-based health care providers, the broader academic community, and to health policy makers.

"A Randomized Trial and Reduce to Disparity in Live Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans comprise a higher percentage of the waiting list for kidney transplantation than would be expected based on population parameters, they wait longer for kidney transplantation, and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT among African Americans with ESRD, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in this patient population. The long-term goal of this research program is to improve education provided to African Americans and, thereby, increase rates of LDKT. The objective of this application is to determine the relative effectiveness of three strategies for increasing LDKT rates in African Americans. The central hypothesis is that a home-based intervention that involves the patient and significant others yields higher LDKT rates in an African American population relative to educational interventions delivered in the transplant center. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the clinical effectiveness of three separate LDKT educational approaches with African American patients; and 2) Determine the sociodemographic, medical, and donation-specific variables that are most strongly associated with pursuing LDKT. One hundred eighty African American adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will be urn randomized to receive one of three educational interventions: home-based (HB), group-based (GB), or standard care (SC). The HB (in the home) and GB (in the transplant center) interventions will provide education to patients and their immediate and extended family members, significant others, and friends. The SC intervention (in the transplant center) mirrors what is currently done at this transplant center and will provide education to individual patients only. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who receive LDKT. Secondary outcomes include live donor inquiries, live donor evaluations, number of potential live donors educated, and LDKT knowledge, concerns, and willingness. Recruitment rates, attrition rates, reasons for nonparticipation and attrition, protocol adherence, and participant satisfaction ratings will be gathered. The proposed research is innovative because it evaluates the relative effectiveness of three educational strategies designed to increase LDKT rates in African Americans. Findings from this study have the potential to close this racial disparity gap by identifying evidence-based educational strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT rates in African Americans. This proposal directly addresses three of the priority areas of HealthyPeople2010 (4-1, 4-5, 4-6).       ",A Randomized Trial and Reduce to Disparity in Live Donor Kidney Transplantation,7337417,R01DK079665,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Physical Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Glomerulonephritis ', ' Heymann Nephritis ', ' Bright Disease ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Homes ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Organ Donations ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Living Donors ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Awareness ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Friends ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2007,248410,0.1571665688231634
"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study According to the 2002 U.S. Census, Hispanics are now the nation's largest minority group There has also been a dramatic rise in the Hispanic end stage renal disease (ESRD) population, with the number of  Hispanics on dialysis increasing by more than 70% between 1996-2001. Further growth of the Hispanic  ESRD population is expected in view of the increasing size of the overall Hispanic population, a high prevalence of diabetes, and an increased incidence of ESRD in Hispanics. Despite the magnitude of this problem, little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hisparics. The Universityof Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is one of seven clinical centers for the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort(CRIC) Study, which is an NIH-sponsored multi-centered study investigating risk factors for progression of kidney and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 3,000 participants with CKD. The CRIC Study cohort is 50% White and 50% Black. This proposal seeks to establish a sizable cohort of Hispanics with CKD that will beintegrated into the overall CRIC Study. The overall aims of this proposal are:  ¿ To determine predictors of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKD.  ¿ To compare rates of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKDwith  those seen in non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks.  ¿ To improve the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) prediction equations in Hispanics withCKD. To achieve these aims, we will recruit and retain 316 Hispanic participants with CKD at UIC to undergo annual visits for relevant exposures (demographics, medical history, medications, diet, cognitive function, and quality of life) and measurements of subclinical CVD and renal function. To test hypotheses of particular importance to Hispanics, this proposal will focus on issues related to visceral adiposity, inflammation, and health care disparities. The linkage of the proposed study to the CRIC Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore risk factors and mechanisms for CKD and CVD progression in Hispanics,which are problems of critical importance from both scientific and public health perspectives.

"Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. L. Ebony Boulware is a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who recently trained in Internal Medicine at University of Maryland Medical Center and completed a fellowship in General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins. She seeks this Mentored Clinical Scientist Award to study why the health burden of CKD is magnified among ethnic/racial minorities. Ethnic/racial disparities in the incidence and prevalence of CKD are striking, with African Americans suffering rates of CKD 4 to 6 times greater than their White counterparts. While some of the excess incidence of ESRD in high-risk populations can be explained by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, much of the excess risk of progression toward ESRD for ethnic minorities remains unexplained.   Building on research experience and skills attained during her fellowship, Dr. Boulware aims to assess potential attitudinal, behavioral, and clinical mechanisms (awareness and perceived susceptibility to disease, adherence, trust and perceived discrimination, patient-physician communication) through which previously unexplained ethnic/racial disparities in CKD could be explained. She will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of participants in a multi-center study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), high-risk African Americans (Jackson Heart Study), and high-risk patients in urban clinical settings (collecting data in her proposed ancillary study to an ongoing NIH/NHLBI-funded randomized controlled trial of persons with hypertension and diabetes in Maryland). Data include medical history, behavioral measures, physical examination measures, and laboratory studies. Analytic methods will include logistic regression, survival analysis, analysis of clustered data, and other longitudinal data analysis techniques.    In addition to experience in the conduct of these studies, Dr. Boulware will enhance her research knowledge and skills through advanced coursework, research team meetings, conferences, and seminars in the supportive and multidisciplinary environment of the Welch Center. This award will provide Dr. Boulware with a foundation to launch her independent research career devoted to understanding the reasons behind ethnic/racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, and in reducing ethnic/racial disparities in CKD.       ",Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities,7279923,K23DK070757,"['Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Life

"Self-Care & Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Kidney loss in the first 10 years following transplantation remains a significant problem despite tremendous scientific advances in treating acute rejection and immunosuppression. This problem is pressing because racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities persist in kidney survival rates causing inequities in graft outcomes. One possible explanation for this survival difference is social inequities in self-care practices of compliance and symptom management. Self-care is essential to the survival of the kidney. But the resources (e.g., financial, social support) for self-care are not equitably distributed in the population. Under the new 2001 Medicare bill (HR 4577), only kidney recipients with disabilities obtain full support for as long as the new kidney functions, but most kidney recipients do not have disabilities, so financial support remains limited. This limitation can lead to the waste of scarce kidneys because it prevents patients from sustaining their kidneys after three years. Consequently, the capacity for and practice of self-care varies by race/ethnicity and insurance status.   The proposed interdisciplinary study will examine the social, cultural, and economic strategies and resources that kidney recipients mobilize to keep their kidneys healthy in the context of limited financial support from insurers. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) examine transplant recipients' health beliefs about kidney survival, compliance, and rejection; 2) investigate transplant recipients' practices of self-care and financially maintaining a kidney transplant; 3) measure the impact of recipients' health beliefs and self-care practices on graft outcomes; and 4) compare self-care practices and graft outcomes among kidney recipients with different demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds.   To accomplish these goals, the proposed four-year longitudinal study will use a multi-method approach for data collection. Data will be gathered prospectively through interviews with kidney recipients every six months and through medical chart review. Identifying the sociocultural and economic processes associated with better graft survival is important for: a) preventing kidney rejection, b) devising compliance interventions, c) preparing candidates for transplant through education, d) evaluating health policies designed to prevent financial barriers to kidney transplantation, and e) eliminating disparities in long-term kidney survival rates         ",Self-Care & Outcomes Among Kidney Transplant Recipients,7278762,K01DK063953,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Data ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' symptom management ', ' Financial Support ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' improved ', ' Half-Life ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Therapeutic immunosuppression ', ' artificial immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Therapy ', ' Antirejection Therapy ', ' Anti-Rejection Therapy ', ' Natural immunosuppression ', ' immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppressions (Physiology) ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' wasting ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Shapes ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Belief ', ' Self Care outcome ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDDK,ALBANY MEDICAL COLLEGE,K01,2007,116544,0.1547035601355223

"Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans are less likely than Whites to receive kidney transplants, despite their being more than two-fold as likely as Whites to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD). Living related kidney donation (LD) offers patients an opportunity to bypass many barriers to receipt of deceased kidney transplants (e.g. waiting lists and immunological incompatibility), but minorities are less likely to receive living related kidney transplants (LRT). Evidence suggests African Americans may not discuss LD/LRT with their families or physicians at optimal rates, and thus may not have adequate information to initiate or participate in shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT. African Americans may also have financial concerns regarding convalescence and out of pocket expenses related to LD/LRT, another barrier impeding LD/LRT.   The primary goals of this study are to overcome these important barriers by enhancing ethnic minorities' consideration of LD/LRT through the promotion of shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT and provision of financial assistance for out of pocket expenses. Our specific aims are: a) to develop culturally sensitive informational (audiovisual) and financial interventions and b) to perform a randomized controlled trial to assess their effectiveness in increasing pursuit of LD/LRT among African American patients with ESRD and their families. We will conduct focus groups to refine the content/delivery of the informational (audiovisual) intervention to promote patient and family shared-decision making and design a written brochure describing the financial assistance (for work loss, childcare and travel costs) intervention. We will enroll 210 adult African American patients with new-onset ESRD from 4 sites (9 dialysis facilities) in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment to pursue LD/LRT (using the Transtheoretical Model for stages of behavior change). Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1) informational incentive alone, 2) informational intervention plus financial assistance, and 3) no intervention (usual care). We will follow participants for up to 12 months for progression in their commitment to LD/LRT (precontemplation stage to contemplation stage to preparation stage to action stage to completion stage (receipt of LD/LRT)). If the interventions are successful in activating patients and their families to consider and undergo LD/LRT, we will disseminate them widely. Effective interventions to improve rates of LD/LRT in African Americans could help eliminate large disparities in receipt of organs for ESRD. The substantial experience of our team in the design and conduct of behavioral, epidemiologic and interventional studies related to donor/recipient health, minority health and kidney disease provides a strong foundation for this research.       ",Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans,7337699,R01DK079682,"['Decision Making ', ' Physical Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Audiovisual Material ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Preparation ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Organ ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' minority health ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Individual ', ' Persons ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Travel ', ' Attitude ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Baltimore ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Bypass ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' desire ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Convalescence ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,233700,0.05657686918273709
"Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease and Vitamin D: Are they related?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   My goal for this career development award is to become an excellent independent investigator in patient-oriented research in chronic kidney disease progression. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are world-wide epidemics with an estimated 19 million people living with CKD and over 300,000 treated with dialysis in the United States. African-Americans and other minorities are disproportionately affected by ESRD with an incidence rate that is almost fourfold that of whites. Risk factors of initiation and progression of CKD and the factors underlying the racial disparities in ESRD have not been fully elucidated. Vitamin D has anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory properties and functions as an endocrine regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. As such, low levels of vitamin D are a potential novel risk factor for progression of CKD. In addition, African-Americans and Hispanics in the United States have lower vitamin D levels than whites, making differences in vitamin D a possible contributor to the differential CKD progression between African-Americans, Hispanics and whites. The first part of my research proposal will use data from the Women's Health Initiative to explore the factors underlying the differences in vitamin D levels between AA and whites. I will then use data from the NHANES III mortality and Medicare linkages to assess associations between low vitamin D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality and incident ESRD. If these associations exist, I will then evaluate whether differences in vitamin D levels may explain the racial disparities in ESRD. My third aim will be to conduct a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D repletion in a multi-ethnic population with CKD, vitamin D deficient and albuminuria to evaluate correction of vitamin D levels, and reductions in albuminuria and blood pressure. I have already proven my commitment and ability to become a successful clinical investigator by obtaining a Master's degree in Clinical Epidemiology and obtaining independent funding as a nephrology fellow through an individual NRSA. This K23 grant will allow me to develop my career through advanced formal coursework, intensive mentoring and the design, planning and conduct of a randomized clinical trial.       ",Racial

"Environmental exposure to metal mixtures and kidney disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human populations are exposed to multiple chemicals through all environmental media. Environmental policies are fragmented and were designed primarily to control exposures to single chemicals in a single medium. Information on low-level population exposure to multiple chemicals has been limited until recent years of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Epidemiological data on the health effects of chemical mixtures is urgently needed to interpret the health implications of actual environmental exposures. We propose to determine whether concurrent exposure to a mixture of nephrotoxic metals is associated with clinical measures of kidney disease. Our long-term goal is to advance our understanding of the health effects of mixtures and improve the scientific basis for environmental policy. We will examine metal mixture exposures in a representative sample of the US population. The metals are barium, cadmium, cobalt, lead, mercury, molybdenum, and uranium. These metals were selected on the basis of toxicological or epidemiological evidence of nephrotoxicity and known population exposure. Demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the exposed population will be described. We will test the hypothesis that multiple exposures are distributed differently across race/ethnicity or socio-economic status. A mixture exposure metric will be developed that accounts for differences in each metal's nephrotoxic potency. Nephrotoxic potency will be determined from research literature. We will examine 2 additional hypotheses: (1) the toxicity-weighted mixture exposure metric will reveal exposure disparities by race/ethnicity or socio- economic status; and (2) those with higher mixture exposure metrics will have reduced creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rates and increased urinary albumin-creatinine ratios. We will test our hypotheses using contingency table analysis, analysis of covariance, and multivariate regression. The significance of this project is three-fold. First, characterization of mixture exposure in the US population is a unique contribution of this project. Second, the burden of kidney disease falls disproportionately on minority and poor populations perhaps due to differential exposure to metal mixtures. Third, this research demonstrates the proposed exposure assessment design in individual-level epidemiological research. Environmental policies rest primarily on studies of single chemical exposure while actual exposures are to mixtures. This research addresses whether current environmental policies protect public health. The National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences stated in its 2006-2011 Strategic Plan that maximal public health impact depends on conducting research relevant to societal decision making.          ",Environmental exposure to metal mixtures and kidney disease,7364390,R03ES016433,"['Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' Policy Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' urinary ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Albumins ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Institutes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Molybdenum ', ' Mo element ', ' Environmental Policy ', ' Animals ', ' Exposure to ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Creatinine clearance measurement ', ' Creatinine Clearance ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Uranium ', ' U element ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Barium ', ' Ba element ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Participant ', ' Disease regression ', ' Prevention ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' falls ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Cobalt ', ' Co element ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' demographics ', ' Creatinine ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,82000,0.07219410610445631
"The Increasing Kidney Disease Awareness Network (IKAN) Transplant Protect    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   A. SPECIFIC AIMS   Research Goal: Using the Increasing Awareness of Kidney Disease Network (IKAN), we will determine barriers to living related donor transplantation and impediments to cadaveric transplantation among African Americans in order to develop culturally competent transplant education material.   Hypothesis: We hypothesize that current available transplant and CKD educational material are not overcoming barriers to educate African Americans regarding transplant options and CKD risk factors.   Research Design: Using an established African American community network and clinics, we will identify educational barriers to living related donor transplantation, cadaveric transplant work up in order to develop specific educational materials that can be used to increase transplantation awareness.

"Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Blacks are disproportionately affected by kidney disease, exhibiting high rates of age-adjusted incident CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and more rapid progression to end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular disease. Prior studies in this area have been limited by the use of creatinine-based measures of kidney function that may mask early kidney disease (declines in kidney function at GFR e 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and by the absence of longitudinal data on cohorts with adequate numbers of Black participants and no prevalent disease at baseline. We propose to combine repeated measurements of cystatin C, a marker of kidney function, with longitudinal data on risk factor and cardiovascular disease development in the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort.  Cystatin C may offer advantages over creatinine-based estimates of kidney function for detecting early declines in function. CARDIA offers a cohort of 5115 young adults with similar numbers of Blacks and Whites and of men and women, who at baseline were aged 18-30 and free of cardiovascular disease. After 20 years of follow-up, Black CARDIA participants (compared with Whites) have 2-fold higher rates of hypertension, 4-fold higher rates of kidney dysfunction, and 10-fold higher rates of heart failure, making this cohort ideal for exploring factors that place Blacks at particular risk for these processes. We will: (1) evaluate declines in kidney function, hypothesizing (a) a greater decline in Blacks that is mediated by hypertension, socioeconomic factors, and inflammation, and (b) that cystatin C will be more sensitive than creatinine-based estimates for detecting declines in kidney function at GFR = 60 ml/min/1.73 m2; (2) determine the association between declining kidney function and subsequent sub-clinical cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing (a) that cystatin C will be a stronger predictor than creatinine-based estimates of GFR or microalbuminuria, and (b) that cystatin C will predict carotid wall thickness more strongly in Blacks, but will predict coronary artery calcium more strongly in Whites; (3) determine the association between declining kidney function and subsequent cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing that cystatin C will be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than creatinine-based estimates of kidney function. The results of this epidemiologic study will provide important insights into the timing of CKD development in young to middle-aged people and the relative importance of various risk factors in kidney function decline and cardiovascular risk. These findings will be important as a guide for preventive efforts and future research, particularly in Blacks.          ",Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Young Adults,7368309,R01DK078124,"['Creatinine ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Cysteine Proteinase Antagonists ', ' Cysteine Protease Inhibitors ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Masks ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Participant ', ' post gamma-globulins ', ' post-gamma-protein ', ' cystatin C ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Microalbuminuria ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complication ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' intima media ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,308518,0.1134539232891877
"Environmental exposure to metal mixtures and kidney disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human populations are exposed to multiple chemicals through all environmental media. Environmental policies are fragmented and were designed primarily to control exposures to single chemicals in a single medium. Information on low-level population exposure to multiple chemicals has been limited until recent years of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Epidemiological data on the health effects of chemical mixtures is urgently needed to interpret the health implications of actual environmental exposures. We propose to determine whether concurrent exposure to a mixture of nephrotoxic metals is associated with clinical measures of kidney disease. Our long-term goal is to advance our understanding of the health effects of mixtures and improve the scientific basis for environmental policy. We will examine metal mixture exposures in a representative sample of the US population. The metals are barium, cadmium, cobalt, lead, mercury, molybdenum, and uranium. These metals were selected on the basis of toxicological or epidemiological evidence of nephrotoxicity and known population exposure. Demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the exposed population will be described. We will test the hypothesis that multiple exposures are distributed differently across race/ethnicity or socio-economic status. A mixture exposure metric will be developed that accounts for differences in each metal's nephrotoxic potency. Nephrotoxic potency will be determined from research literature. We will examine 2 additional hypotheses: (1) the toxicity-weighted mixture exposure metric will reveal exposure disparities by race/ethnicity or socio- economic status; and (2) those with higher mixture exposure metrics will have reduced creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rates and increased urinary albumin-creatinine ratios. We will test our hypotheses using contingency table analysis, analysis of covariance, and multivariate regression. The significance of this project is three-fold. First, characterization of mixture exposure in the US population is a unique contribution of this project. Second, the burden of kidney disease falls disproportionately on minority and poor populations perhaps due to differential exposure to metal mixtures. Third, this research demonstrates the proposed exposure assessment design in individual-level epidemiological research. Environmental policies rest primarily on studies of single chemical exposure while actual exposures are to mixtures. This research addresses whether current environmental policies protect public health. The National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences stated in its 2006-2011 Strategic Plan that maximal public health impact depends on conducting research relevant to societal decision making.          ",Environmental exposure to metal mixtures and kidney disease,7502022,R03ES016433,"['Creatinine ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' Policy Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' urinary ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Albumins ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Institutes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Molybdenum ', ' Mo element ', ' Environmental Policy ', ' Animals ', ' Exposure to ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Creatinine clearance measurement ', ' Creatinine Clearance ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Uranium ', ' U element ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Barium ', ' Ba element ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Participant ', ' Disease regression ', ' Prevention ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' falls ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Cobalt ', ' Co element ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,80360,0.07219410610445631
"Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans are less likely than Whites to receive kidney transplants, despite their being more than two-fold as likely as Whites to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD). Living related kidney donation (LD) offers patients an opportunity to bypass many barriers to receipt of deceased kidney transplants (e.g. waiting lists and immunological incompatibility), but minorities are less likely to receive living related kidney transplants (LRT). Evidence suggests African Americans may not discuss LD/LRT with their families or physicians at optimal rates, and thus may not have adequate information to initiate or participate in shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT. African Americans may also have financial concerns regarding convalescence and out of pocket expenses related to LD/LRT, another barrier impeding LD/LRT.   The primary goals of this study are to overcome these important barriers by enhancing ethnic minorities' consideration of LD/LRT through the promotion of shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT and provision of financial assistance for out of pocket expenses. Our specific aims are: a) to develop culturally sensitive informational (audiovisual) and financial interventions and b) to perform a randomized controlled trial to assess their effectiveness in increasing pursuit of LD/LRT among African American patients with ESRD and their families. We will conduct focus groups to refine the content/delivery of the informational (audiovisual) intervention to promote patient and family shared-decision making and design a written brochure describing the financial assistance (for work loss, childcare and travel costs) intervention. We will enroll 210 adult African American patients with new-onset ESRD from 4 sites (9 dialysis facilities) in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment to pursue LD/LRT (using the Transtheoretical Model for stages of behavior change). Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1) informational incentive alone, 2) informational intervention plus financial assistance, and 3) no intervention (usual care). We will follow participants for up to 12 months for progression in their commitment to LD/LRT (precontemplation stage to contemplation stage to preparation stage to action stage to completion stage (receipt of LD/LRT)). If the interventions are successful in activating patients and their families to consider and undergo LD/LRT, we will disseminate them widely. Effective interventions to improve rates of LD/LRT in African Americans could help eliminate large disparities in receipt of organs for ESRD. The substantial experience of our team in the design and conduct of behavioral, epidemiologic and interventional studies related to donor/recipient health, minority health and kidney disease provides a strong foundation for this research.       ",Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans,7494489,R01DK079682,"['Decision Making ', ' Physical Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Audiovisual Material ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Preparation ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Organ ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' minority health ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Individual ', ' Persons ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Travel ', ' Attitude ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Baltimore ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Bypass ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' desire ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Convalescence ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,229026,0.05657686918273709
"Racial Differences in Phosphorus Metabolism in Health and in Kidney Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Candidate: Orlando Gutierrez received his MD from the University of Toledo, and completed his Internal Medicine Residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is currently a clinical and research fellow in nephrology at MGH, and a candidate for a Master's degree in human physiological investigation from Harvard Medical School. Mentor: Dr. David Nathan is a renowned clinical investigator who has trained numerous investigators in patient-oriented clinical research. Dr. Nathan will ensure the success of Dr. Gutierrez's research training, project, and overall career development. Research: Blacks with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progress to end stage renal disease and develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) more rapidly than Whites. The mechanisms that underlie these disparities remain elusive. Hyperphosphatemia is linked with both accelerated kidney and CVD progression. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) are the primary hormones that regulate serum phosphate (Pi) levels. Preliminary data from our group indicate that Blacks with CKD have a higher prevalence of hyperphosphatemia than Whites at all levels of glomerular filtration rate despite higher PTH levels, suggesting that Blacks have impaired Pi excreting capacity. Impaired Pi excretion may represent a novel risk factor for faster kidney and CV disease progression in Blacks. However, no studies have examined differences in Pi handling by race. For Aim 1, we will examine racial differences in gut and renal Pi handling by measuring (1) gut Pi absorption after a fixed Pi meal and (2) dynamic changes in urinary Pi excretion in response to oral Pi loading in healthy Blacks vs. Whites. For Aim 2, we will examine racial differences in hormonal reguation of Pi metabolism by comparing (1) the phosphaturic effect of synthetic PTH infusion and (2) dynamic changes in FGF-23 levels after oral Pi loading in healthy Blacks vs. Whites. For Aim 3, we will examine racial differences in Pi handling in CKD by measuring urinary Pi excretion in response to dietary Pi loading in Blacks vs. Whites with CKD. We will then compare any differences in CKD to those seen in healthy individuals. We believe the results of these studies will provide critical new insights into racial differences in Pi metabolism that may help elucidate racial disparities in CKD outcomes with important public health implications. A K23 award will allow Dr. Gutierrez to attain new skills in clinical investigation and develop into an independent clinical investigator.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We believe the results of these studies will provide critical new insights into racial differences in serum phosphate metabolism that may help elucidate racial disparities in chronic kidney disease outcomes with important public health implications.                ",Racial Differences in Phosphorus Metabolism in Health and in Kidney Disease,7513100,K23DK081673,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Physical Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Diet ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Dietary intake ', ' training project ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Epidemic ', ' Cyclic AMP ', ' cAMP ', "" adenosine 3'5' monophosphate "", "" Adenosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogen phosphate) "", ' Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', "" Adenosine Cyclic 3',5'-Monophosphate "", "" 3'5'-cyclic ester of AMP "", ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Mentored Clinical Oncology Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Oncology Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Rate ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' General Hospitals ', ' human PTH protein ', ' human parathyroid hormone ', ' hPTH(1-84) ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Excretory function ', ' excretion ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nephrons ', ' Uriniferous Tube ', ' Parathyroid Hormones ', ' parathormone ', ' Parathyroid Hormone (1-84) ', ' PTH (1-84) ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Hormonal ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' phosphorus metabolism ', ' success ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' absorption ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' response ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' hormone regulation ', ' hormonal regulation ', ' Accounting ', ' feeding ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' fibroblast growth factor 23 ', ' FGF23 gene product ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2008,136350,0.07164340455961171
"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   According to the 2002 U.S. Census, Hispanics are now the nation's largest minority group. There has also been a dramatic rise in the Hispanic end stage renal disease (ESRD) population, with the number of Hispanics on dialysis increasing by more than 70 percent between 1996 and 2001. Further growth of the Hispanic ESRD population is expected in view of the increasing size of the overall Hispanic population, a high prevalence of diabetes, and an increased incidence of ESRD in Hispanics. Despite the magnitude of this problem, little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is one of seven clinical centers for the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, which is an NIH-sponsored multi-centered study investigating risk factors for progression of kidney and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 3,000 participants with CKD. The CRIC Study cohort is 50 percent White and 50 percent Black. This application seeks to establish a sizable cohort of Hispanics with CKD that will be integrated into the overall CRIC Study.

To compare rates of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKD with those seen in non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks.   3. To improve the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) prediction equations in Hispanics with CKD.   To achieve these aims, we will recruit and retain 316 Hispanic participants with CKD at UIC to undergo annual visits for relevant exposures (demographics, medical history, medications, diet, cognitive function, and quality of life) and measurements of subclinical CVD and renal function. To test hypotheses of particular importance to Hispanics, this proposal will focus on issues related to visceral adiposity, inflammation, and health care disparities.

"Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. L. Ebony Boulware is a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who recently trained in Internal Medicine at University of Maryland Medical Center and completed a fellowship in General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins. She seeks this Mentored Clinical Scientist Award to study why the health burden of CKD is magnified among ethnic/racial minorities. Ethnic/racial disparities in the incidence and prevalence of CKD are striking, with African Americans suffering rates of CKD 4 to 6 times greater than their White counterparts. While some of the excess incidence of ESRD in high-risk populations can be explained by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, much of the excess risk of progression toward ESRD for ethnic minorities remains unexplained.   Building on research experience and skills attained during her fellowship, Dr. Boulware aims to assess potential attitudinal, behavioral, and clinical mechanisms (awareness and perceived susceptibility to disease, adherence, trust and perceived discrimination, patient-physician communication) through which previously unexplained ethnic/racial disparities in CKD could be explained. She will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of participants in a multi-center study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), high-risk African Americans (Jackson Heart Study), and high-risk patients in urban clinical settings (collecting data in her proposed ancillary study to an ongoing NIH/NHLBI-funded randomized controlled trial of persons with hypertension and diabetes in Maryland). Data include medical history, behavioral measures, physical examination measures, and laboratory studies. Analytic methods will include logistic regression, survival analysis, analysis of clustered data, and other longitudinal data analysis techniques.    In addition to experience in the conduct of these studies, Dr. Boulware will enhance her research knowledge and skills through advanced coursework, research team meetings, conferences, and seminars in the supportive and multidisciplinary environment of the Welch Center. This award will provide Dr. Boulware with a foundation to launch her independent research career devoted to understanding the reasons behind ethnic/racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, and in reducing ethnic/racial disparities in CKD.       ",Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities,7488911,K23DK070757,"['Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ',

"Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is a request for a Mentored Career Award for Faculty at Minority Institutions that will allow the candidate to develop a long-term research program concerned with the relationship between socio- economic distress (SED) associated with disadvantaged minority group membership and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The primary goal of this research project is to develop and elaborate a model specifying how distressing social and economic environments are associated with psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that impact the prevalence of CKD among African Americans. This project proposal outlines a plan of career development and intensive research activities that will leverage already completed doctoral level research and training in the social sciences. Substantive courses in addition to intense topical workshops and seminars will provide a structured means to strengthen five core competencies (i. e., epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, leadership, and scientific presentation) that are necessary to establish a program of research investigating how non-traditional, non-biomedical factors and traditional biomedical risk factors independently and collectively impact CKD among an at-risk population. The research proposed in this application has three specific aims. The proposed project will: 1) examine the extent to which socio-economic distress or SED is associated with CKD among African Americans: 2) assess the degree to which potentially mediating mechanisms are independently and collectively associated with CKD among African Americans; and 3) determine the extent to which the relationship between SED and CKD is mediated by psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical factors. The models associated with each aim will be assessed through an innovative analysis of data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). The JHS is a longitudinal, population-based study of CVD and related risk factors among African Americans in Mississippi - the state with the worst health profile in the nation. The resources at Meharry Medical College, Vanderbilt University, and the JHS provide a unique setting for a five year program of mentored research, education, and training that will build on the candidate's background in the social sciences to produce cutting-edge epidemiological research focusing on health disparities, CKD, and CVD. This research will incorporate information about the context in which African Americans live and work into empirical models specifying how non-traditional (as well as traditional) biomedical risk factors impact health outcomes; thereby informing health policy's effort to address and eliminate CKD and CVD disparities.           ",Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study,7430277,K01HL088735,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Research Training ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Heart ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Distress ', ' Leadership ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Research Activity ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mississippi ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Training and Education ', ' Structure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NHLBI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,K01,2008,125722,0.0862006873106904
"Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease and Vitamin D: Are they related?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   My goal for this career development award is to become an excellent independent investigator in patient-oriented research in chronic kidney disease progression. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are world-wide epidemics with an estimated 19 million people living with CKD and over 300,000 treated with dialysis in the United States. African-Americans and other minorities are disproportionately affected by ESRD with an incidence rate that is almost fourfold that of whites. Risk factors of initiation and progression of CKD and the factors underlying the racial disparities in ESRD have not been fully elucidated. Vitamin D has anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory properties and functions as an endocrine regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. As such, low levels of vitamin D are a potential novel risk factor for progression of CKD. In addition, African-Americans and Hispanics in the United States have lower vitamin D levels than whites, making differences in vitamin D a possible contributor to the differential CKD progression between African-Americans, Hispanics and whites. The first part of my research proposal will use data from the Women's Health Initiative to explore the factors underlying the differences in vitamin D levels between AA and whites. I will then use data from the NHANES III mortality and Medicare linkages to assess associations between low vitamin D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality and incident ESRD. If these associations exist, I will then evaluate whether differences in vitamin D levels may explain the racial disparities in ESRD. My third aim will be to conduct a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D repletion in a multi-ethnic population with CKD, vitamin D deficient and albuminuria to evaluate correction of vitamin D levels, and reductions in albuminuria and blood pressure. I have already proven my commitment and ability to become a successful clinical investigator by obtaining a Master's degree in Clinical Epidemiology and obtaining independent funding as a nephrology fellow through an individual NRSA. This K23 grant will allow me to develop my career through advanced formal coursework, intensive mentoring and the design, planning and conduct of a randomized clinical trial.       ",Racial

"Drew/RAND/UCLA Comprehensive Center fo Health Disparity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Healthy People 2010 recognizes chronic kidney disease (CKD) as one of 28 focus areas to improve the nation's health. To address these goals, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (Drew) is proposing to establish a Comprehensive Center on Health Disparities (CCHD) focusing on CKD. The foundation for the center will be a formalized partnership between Drew, UCLA and RAND. The Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD will bring important strengths to disparities-focused research. Los Angeles County is an ideal setting for this center, being one of the most diverse counties in the United States, and one with major population concentrations of disadvantaged minority groups disproportionately affected by high rates of CKD (and major CKD risk factors), related morbidity and mortality, as well as some of the lowest rates of educational attainment, income and health insurance coverage in the nation. The center will focus on contextual, community, and health care delivery factors as they relate to CKD disparities among the nation's minority and disadvantaged populations, using a bench to bedside approach that impacts relevant health care policy. The overall goals are to reduce the incidence of death related to CKD and improve the quality of life for those who have CKD. Drew and its partners propose to address these goals through the activities of four cores: 1) The Administrative and Scientific Core, 2) the Community Outreach and Information Dissemination (Community) Core, 3) the Chronic Kidney Disease Health Outcomes and Policy Core, and 4) the Developmental Core.   The Specific Aims of the Drew/RAND/UCLA CCHD-CKD are to:   1) Promote the conduct of methodologically rigorous research (focusing on national CKD priority areas) aimed at improving outcomes for CKD patients;   2) Promote the conduct of methodologically rigorous research (focusing on national CKD priority areas)  aimed at reducing disparities in CKD and CKD risk factors for disadvantaged African American and Latino patients;   3) Build research capacity and provide both formal training in academic and community-based settings for CKD/health disparities researchers at Drew University;   4) Educate and increase the participation of medically underserved minorities in evidence-based health promotion and disease prevention research directed toward CKD and CKD risk factors; and   5) Disseminate results of relevant efficacy studies and health information in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner to this population, community-based health care providers, the broader academic community, and to health policy makers.

"Engaging Communities and Institutions to Reduce Health Disparities in Cleveland    DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Cleveland is characterized by an extremely high poverty rate, substantial numbers of racial/ethnic minorities, and marked health disparities. We propose to engage Cleveland's health care providers, educational institutions, community organizations, and government agencies to understand and reduce health disparities.  To take advantage of pre-existing community and institutional strengths, we will focus initially on 3 interrelated prototypical conditions: hypertension, kidney disease, and transplantation. These conditions affect many individuals and have some of the most striking health disparities observed in the United States.      The Research Core includes projects that involve (a) utilizing lay health advisors to help patients address the social contextual factors that act as barriers to hypertension management, (b) utilizing interpreters as advocates for Spanish speaking patients with hypertension or kidney disease, and (c) utilizing transplant recipients as navigators to improve access to kidney transplantation. The Research Training/Education Core involves (a) recruiting students, particularly from minority backgrounds, into undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral programs related to health disparities, (b) providing diverse educational opportunities relevant to health disparities research, and (c) supporting postdoctoral students and junior faculty, particularly from underrepresented groups, to ensure successful entry into academic positions. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core involves a community-based video intervention to enhance signing of organ donor cards. The Administrative Core will coordinate and foster interactions across projects/cores, provide shared resources and personnel, assist in other community efforts to address disparities, lead interactions with other NCMHD Research Centers of Excellence, disseminate findings, and develop future initiatives. Each of the three research projects as well as the Community Engagement/Outreach Core focus on testing interventions to reduce health disparities. Moreover, the design of these interventions is informed by an understanding of the mechanisms that created health disparities in each of the areas studied. Other strengths and innovative features of our application include selection of projects through a community-wide approach, a strong institutional commitment, and the experience and commitment of the study team. In addition, the proposed projects have been designed not only to address an important aspect of health disparities but also to set the stage for future larger scale efforts. The community and institutional infrastructure established as a result of conducting these projects will be used in future efforts that target a broader range of conditions          ",Engaging Communities and Institutions to Reduce Health Disparities in Cleveland,7495090,P60MD002265,[''],NIMHD,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P60,2008,1867048,0.08989872115308059
"A Randomized Trial and Reduce to Disparity in Live Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans comprise a higher percentage of the waiting list for kidney transplantation than would be expected based on population parameters, they wait longer for kidney transplantation, and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT among African Americans with ESRD, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in this patient population. The long-term goal of this research program is to improve education provided to African Americans and, thereby, increase rates of LDKT. The objective of this application is to determine the relative effectiveness of three strategies for increasing LDKT rates in African Americans. The central hypothesis is that a home-based intervention that involves the patient and significant others yields higher LDKT rates in an African American population relative to educational interventions delivered in the transplant center. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the clinical effectiveness of three separate LDKT educational approaches with African American patients; and 2) Determine the sociodemographic, medical, and donation-specific variables that are most strongly associated with pursuing LDKT. One hundred eighty African American adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will be urn randomized to receive one of three educational interventions: home-based (HB), group-based (GB), or standard care (SC). The HB (in the home) and GB (in the transplant center) interventions will provide education to patients and their immediate and extended family members, significant others, and friends. The SC intervention (in the transplant center) mirrors what is currently done at this transplant center and will provide education to individual patients only. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who receive LDKT. Secondary outcomes include live donor inquiries, live donor evaluations, number of potential live donors educated, and LDKT knowledge, concerns, and willingness. Recruitment rates, attrition rates, reasons for nonparticipation and attrition, protocol adherence, and participant satisfaction ratings will be gathered. The proposed research is innovative because it evaluates the relative effectiveness of three educational strategies designed to increase LDKT rates in African Americans. Findings from this study have the potential to close this racial disparity gap by identifying evidence-based educational strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT rates in African Americans. This proposal directly addresses three of the priority areas of HealthyPeople2010 (4-1, 4-5, 4-6).       ",A Randomized Trial and Reduce to Disparity in Live Donor Kidney Transplantation,7479097,R01DK079665,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Physical Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Glomerulonephritis ', ' Heymann Nephritis ', ' Bright Disease ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Homes ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Organ Donations ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Living Donors ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Awareness ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Friends ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2008,243119,0.1571665688231634
"Patient-Oriented Research in Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Neil R. Powe, MD, is Professor of Medicine and Director of the Welch Center at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He holds a joint appointment in the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where he is the Director of the Clinical Epidemiology Program. He is seeking renewal of this Mid-career Award in Patient-oriented Research to enhance his efforts in clinical research in kidney disease and to continue to build the training program in kidney disease research. Dr. Powe has conducted several clinical investigations in nephrology including studies of: etiology (racial disparities in occurrence of ESRD and a randomized clinical trial of low-versus highosmolality contrast media-induced nephrotoxicity); diagnosis (comparison of physical examination with color flow doppler for detection of vascular access failure); therapy (effectiveness of recombinant human erythropoietin for treatment of anemia of ESRD); and prognosis (incidence, risk factors and prognosis of septicemia and comorbid cardiovascular disease in ESRD patients); and determinants of health disparities. Dr. Powe directs the Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for ESRD (CHOICE) study. This is a national prospective cohort study comparing treatment and outcomes in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. The study has 1041 patients enrolled, making it one of the largest and most representative prospective cohorts of dialysis patients ever studied in the U.S. Data on medical history, laboratory studies, comorbidity and severity of disease and clinical outcomes are being collected. The study has also established a specimen bank which provides opportunities for examining mechanisms for the consequences of kidney disease or its treatment. Ethnic minorities make up a disproportionate share of the population with ESRD. Dr. Powe would like to extend his work into understanding the biologic, clinical and behavioral determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease.

"Living Donor Information Network for Caregiving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 19 million Americans experience the devastating and costly effects of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) African Americans (AA) experience an incidence and prevalence rates 4-6 times greater than Caucasian Americans. Compounding this disparity is the low rate of AAs receiving living kidney donation, which provides the best survival and improvement in physical and psychological outcomes. Only 12% of the living kidney donors in 2008 were AAs. Inadequate donor candidate and caregiver information about donation, and a lack of trust in the healthcare team and transplant center are critical barriers which have been reported (Boulware et al. 2002; Sankar et al., 2006). The purpose of the proposed study is to pilot test randomized clinical trial (RCT) procedures to determine the association of a web-based information and support intervention on donor and informal caregiver psychological outcomes and trust in the transplant team and transplant center. The Living Donor Information Network for Caregiving (LINC) has three components: 1) information modules and links, 2) a discussion board with former kidney donors and their caregivers as mentors, and 3) online study instruments. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) To determine the relationship between donor candidate and caregiver characteristics including race (black and white), previous internet use, and postoperative physical status to use of LINC (times and modules accessed and number of posts). 2) To determine associations in donor candidate and caregiver characteristics to psychological outcomes and trust in the healthcare team and transplant center among those with and without LINC. 3) To explore donor candidate and informal caregiver use of the LINC discussion board. This intervention will address the barrier of inadequate information from health professionals and may diminish concerns among AAs that information provided is inadequate due to racial biases. The long-term objective of LINC is to develop a model of online information and support to be implemented at transplant centers nationally to increase the number of AA living kidney donors. A mixed method approach will be used with quantitative analysis and qualitative description serving to enrich and provide context for quantitative findings. The LINC intervention will provide a model for transplant centers nationally in the use of web-based technology to provide information and support to living organ donors and their informal caregivers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an urgent need to address End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in over 19 million Americans and particularly in African Americans who experience incidence and prevalence rates 4-6 times greater than Caucasian Americans but receive only 12% of the living kidney donations. The disparity in living donations among African Americans which is attributed to inadequate education and support of potential donors can be addressed using the internet at this time of rapidly increasing access to internet-based health information among African Americans (Pew, 2007). The Living Donor Information Network for Caregiving (LINC) is an innovative, web-based intervention that provides education and support to living kidney donors and their informal caregivers in a study population that is racially, ethnically, and culturally diverse.              There is an urgent need to address End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in over 19 million Americans and particularly in African Americans who experience incidence and prevalence rates 4-6 times greater than Caucasian Americans but receive only 12% of the living kidney donations.

"Financial Risks and Ethnic/Racial Disparities in Live Kidney Donation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tanjala S. Purnell is a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a research trainee at the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research. She seeks this National Research Service Award (NRSA) Training Grant to support her career development with the goal of becoming a successful independent clinical researcher studying ways to address ethnic/racial health disparities for patients with chronic kidney disease. During this award, Ms. Purnell will pursue rigorous research and didactic training in a program designed to provide a strong foundation for her future career. In her research, she will examine ethnic/racial differences in attitudes regarding economic risks of live kidney donation, determine whether ethnic/racial differences in attitudes are associated with ethnic/race differences in willingness to donate, and she will assess the impact of federal and state policy interventions addressing economic barriers to live donation upon ethnic/racial differences in live kidney donation rates. Additionally, she will assess whether access to enabling resources (including income/wealth, health insurance, and occupational prestige) explain the relation of ethnic/race differences in attitudes toward economic risks and ethnic/race differences in willingness to donate. To accomplish these aims, she will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of living kidney donation attitudes and behaviors in the United States, utilizing complex weighted survey data obtained from regional and national studies of persons in the general public and by creating a national dataset of living kidney donors utilizing publicly available data from several sources. She will employ regression analyses, multiple-time series analyses, and other longitudinal analysis techniques in these studies. Ms. Purnell's research objectives are closely aligned with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases end-stage renal disease target focus of improving rates of kidney transplantation and donation, particularly by African Americans and other ethnic/racial minority groups. In her didactic program, Ms. Purnell will take advanced coursework in research methods, including advanced techniques in study design and analysis, grant writing, and research ethics. Through attendance at national meetings as well as several advanced research seminars, held in the supportive training environment at the Welch Center, she will also have the opportunity to observe the work of others and present her own work. She has identified a team of experienced faculty mentors who are committed to supporting her success and who will make sure she has the resources to assure her completion of the proposed aims of this application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My primary career goal is to become a successful independent health services and policy researcher whose work directly contributes to improving health outcomes and reducing disparities in measures of access and quality for patients with chronic kidney disease. I want my future work to contribute to the implementation of federal and state policy legislation that improves health outcomes for chronic kidney disease patients and influences healthcare decision-making that will improve delivery of care for vulnerable populations. I also plan to motivate and train future health services and policy researchers by pursuing a career in academia. The Kirschstein-NRSA Fellowship Training Award will provide me with the opportunity to further develop the skills I need to pursue my research and career goals. This award will allow me to concentrate on coursework and opportunities for experiential learning that will facilitate the successful completion of my dissertation work, as well as my development as an independent health services and policy researcher. In addition to the coursework, an integral focus of my training activities during the fellowship award period will be to engage in special studies and to participate in research projects with faculty members and researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions, and the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research on projects directly related to my career goals.           ",Financial Risks and Ethnic/Racial Disparities in Live Kidney Donation,7754518,F31DK084840,"['federal policy ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Insurance ', ' Training ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Policies ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Living Donors ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Solutions ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Attitude ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Complex ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Occupational ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Research Ethics ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,41176,0.11998138436835201
"Environmental exposure to metal mixtures and kidney disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human populations are exposed to multiple chemicals through all environmental media. Environmental policies are fragmented and were designed primarily to control exposures to single chemicals in a single medium. Information on low-level population exposure to multiple chemicals has been limited until recent years of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Epidemiological data on the health effects of chemical mixtures is urgently needed to interpret the health implications of actual environmental exposures. We propose to determine whether concurrent exposure to a mixture of nephrotoxic metals is associated with clinical measures of kidney disease. Our long-term goal is to advance our understanding of the health effects of mixtures and improve the scientific basis for environmental policy. We will examine metal mixture exposures in a representative sample of the US population. The metals are barium, cadmium, cobalt, lead, mercury, molybdenum, and uranium. These metals were selected on the basis of toxicological or epidemiological evidence of nephrotoxicity and known population exposure. Demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the exposed population will be described. We will test the hypothesis that multiple exposures are distributed differently across race/ethnicity or socio-economic status. A mixture exposure metric will be developed that accounts for differences in each metal's nephrotoxic potency. Nephrotoxic potency will be determined from research literature. We will examine 2 additional hypotheses: (1) the toxicity-weighted mixture exposure metric will reveal exposure disparities by race/ethnicity or socio- economic status; and (2) those with higher mixture exposure metrics will have reduced creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rates and increased urinary albumin-creatinine ratios. We will test our hypotheses using contingency table analysis, analysis of covariance, and multivariate regression. The significance of this project is three-fold. First, characterization of mixture exposure in the US population is a unique contribution of this project. Second, the burden of kidney disease falls disproportionately on minority and poor populations perhaps due to differential exposure to metal mixtures. Third, this research demonstrates the proposed exposure assessment design in individual-level epidemiological research. Environmental policies rest primarily on studies of single chemical exposure while actual exposures are to mixtures. This research addresses whether current environmental policies protect public health. The National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences stated in its 2006-2011 Strategic Plan that maximal public health impact depends on conducting research relevant to societal decision making.

"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   According to the 2002 U.S. Census, Hispanics are now the nation's largest minority group. There has also been a dramatic rise in the Hispanic end stage renal disease (ESRD) population, with the number of Hispanics on dialysis increasing by more than 70 percent between 1996 and 2001. Further growth of the Hispanic ESRD population is expected in view of the increasing size of the overall Hispanic population, a high prevalence of diabetes, and an increased incidence of ESRD in Hispanics. Despite the magnitude of this problem, little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is one of seven clinical centers for the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, which is an NIH-sponsored multi-centered study investigating risk factors for progression of kidney and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 3,000 participants with CKD. The CRIC Study cohort is 50 percent White and 50 percent Black. This application seeks to establish a sizable cohort of Hispanics with CKD that will be integrated into the overall CRIC Study. The overall aims of this application are:   1. To determine predictors of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKD.   2. To compare rates of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKD with those seen in non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks.   3. To improve the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) prediction equations in Hispanics with CKD.   To achieve these aims, we will recruit and retain 316 Hispanic participants with CKD at UIC to undergo annual visits for relevant exposures (demographics, medical history, medications, diet, cognitive function, and quality of life) and measurements of subclinical CVD and renal function. To test hypotheses of particular importance to Hispanics, this proposal will focus on issues related to visceral adiposity, inflammation, and health care disparities. The linkage of the proposed study to the CRIC Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore risk factors and mechanisms for CKD and CVD progression in Hispanics, which are problems of critical importance from both scientific and public health perspectives.

"Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans are less likely than Whites to receive kidney transplants, despite their being more than two-fold as likely as Whites to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD). Living related kidney donation (LD) offers patients an opportunity to bypass many barriers to receipt of deceased kidney transplants (e.g. waiting lists and immunological incompatibility), but minorities are less likely to receive living related kidney transplants (LRT). Evidence suggests African Americans may not discuss LD/LRT with their families or physicians at optimal rates, and thus may not have adequate information to initiate or participate in shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT. African Americans may also have financial concerns regarding convalescence and out of pocket expenses related to LD/LRT, another barrier impeding LD/LRT.   The primary goals of this study are to overcome these important barriers by enhancing ethnic minorities' consideration of LD/LRT through the promotion of shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT and provision of financial assistance for out of pocket expenses. Our specific aims are: a) to develop culturally sensitive informational (audiovisual) and financial interventions and b) to perform a randomized controlled trial to assess their effectiveness in increasing pursuit of LD/LRT among African American patients with ESRD and their families. We will conduct focus groups to refine the content/delivery of the informational (audiovisual) intervention to promote patient and family shared-decision making and design a written brochure describing the financial assistance (for work loss, childcare and travel costs) intervention. We will enroll 210 adult African American patients with new-onset ESRD from 4 sites (9 dialysis facilities) in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment to pursue LD/LRT (using the Transtheoretical Model for stages of behavior change). Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1) informational incentive alone, 2) informational intervention plus financial assistance, and 3) no intervention (usual care). We will follow participants for up to 12 months for progression in their commitment to LD/LRT (precontemplation stage to contemplation stage to preparation stage to action stage to completion stage (receipt of LD/LRT)). If the interventions are successful in activating patients and their families to consider and undergo LD/LRT, we will disseminate them widely. Effective interventions to improve rates of LD/LRT in African Americans could help eliminate large disparities in receipt of organs for ESRD. The substantial experience of our team in the design and conduct of behavioral, epidemiologic and interventional studies related to donor/recipient health, minority health and kidney disease provides a strong foundation for this research.       ",Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans,7681132,R01DK079682,"['Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Audiovisual Material ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Organ ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' minority health ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Individual ', ' Persons ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Travel ', ' Attitude ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Baltimore ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Bypass ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' effective intervention ', ' successful intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' shared decision making ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Convalescence ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,229026,0.05657686918273709
"Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is a request for a Mentored Career Award for Faculty at Minority Institutions that will allow the candidate to develop a long-term research program concerned with the relationship between socio- economic distress (SED) associated with disadvantaged minority group membership and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The primary goal of this research project is to develop and elaborate a model specifying how distressing social and economic environments are associated with psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that impact the prevalence of CKD among African Americans. This project proposal outlines a plan of career development and intensive research activities that will leverage already completed doctoral level research and training in the social sciences. Substantive courses in addition to intense topical workshops and seminars will provide a structured means to strengthen five core competencies (i. e., epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, leadership, and scientific presentation) that are necessary to establish a program of research investigating how non-traditional, non-biomedical factors and traditional biomedical risk factors independently and collectively impact CKD among an at-risk population. The research proposed in this application has three specific aims. The proposed project will: 1) examine the extent to which socio-economic distress or SED is associated with CKD among African Americans: 2) assess the degree to which potentially mediating mechanisms are independently and collectively associated with CKD among African Americans; and 3) determine the extent to which the relationship between SED and CKD is mediated by psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical factors. The models associated with each aim will be assessed through an innovative analysis of data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). The JHS is a longitudinal, population-based study of CVD and related risk factors among African Americans in Mississippi - the state with the worst health profile in the nation. The resources at Meharry Medical College, Vanderbilt University, and the JHS provide a unique setting for a five year program of mentored research, education, and training that will build on the candidate's background in the social sciences to produce cutting-edge epidemiological research focusing on health disparities, CKD, and CVD. This research will incorporate information about the context in which African Americans live and work into empirical models specifying how non-traditional (as well as traditional) biomedical risk factors impact health outcomes; thereby informing health policy's effort to address and eliminate CKD and CVD disparities.           ",Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study,7617903,K01HL088735,"['Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Research Training ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Heart ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Distress ', ' Leadership ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Research Activity ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mississippi ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Training and Education ', ' Structure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' population based ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' ']",NHLBI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,K01,2009,125722,0.0862006873106904
"Engaging Communities and Institutions to Reduce Health Disparities in Cleveland    DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Cleveland is characterized by an extremely high poverty rate, substantial numbers of racial/ethnic minorities, and marked health disparities. We propose to engage Cleveland's health care providers, educational institutions, community organizations, and government agencies to understand and reduce health disparities.  To take advantage of pre-existing community and institutional strengths, we will focus initially on 3 interrelated prototypical conditions: hypertension, kidney disease, and transplantation. These conditions affect many individuals and have some of the most striking health disparities observed in the United States.      The Research Core includes projects that involve (a) utilizing lay health advisors to help patients address the social contextual factors that act as barriers to hypertension management, (b) utilizing interpreters as advocates for Spanish speaking patients with hypertension or kidney disease, and (c) utilizing transplant recipients as navigators to improve access to kidney transplantation. The Research Training/Education Core involves (a) recruiting students, particularly from minority backgrounds, into undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral programs related to health disparities, (b) providing diverse educational opportunities relevant to health disparities research, and (c) supporting postdoctoral students and junior faculty, particularly from underrepresented groups, to ensure successful entry into academic positions. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core involves a community-based video intervention to enhance signing of organ donor cards. The Administrative Core will coordinate and foster interactions across projects/cores, provide shared resources and personnel, assist in other community efforts to address disparities, lead interactions with other NCMHD Research Centers of Excellence, disseminate findings, and develop future initiatives. Each of the three research projects as well as the Community Engagement/Outreach Core focus on testing interventions to reduce health disparities. Moreover, the design of these interventions is informed by an understanding of the mechanisms that created health disparities in each of the areas studied. Other strengths and innovative features of our application include selection of projects through a community-wide approach, a strong institutional commitment, and the experience and commitment of the study team. In addition, the proposed projects have been designed not only to address an important aspect of health disparities but also to set the stage for future larger scale efforts. The community and institutional infrastructure established as a result of conducting these projects will be used in future efforts that target a broader range of conditions          ",Engaging Communities and Institutions to Reduce Health Disparities in Cleveland,7620019,P60MD002265,[''],NIMHD,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P60,2009,1866510,0.08989872115308059
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Kidney Function Decline: Genes or Environment?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carmen A. Peralta, who proposes a novel, multi-disciplinary approach to understanding racial/ethnic disparities in kidney function decline. This award will allow Dr. Peralta the resources and protected time to achieve the following career development goals: (1) to become an independent, translational clinical researcher in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease; (2) to become an expert in the application of genetic epidemiology methods to study these differences; and (3) to utilize sociodemographic measurements to improve understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in these disparities. To achieve these goals, Dr. Peralta has assembled a mentoring team comprised of her sponsor and primary mentor, Dr. Michael Shlipak (an expert in the field of cardiovascular complications of early kidney dysfunction), and two co-mentors: Dr. Neil Risch (a genetic epidemiologist) and Dr. Paula Braveman (an expert in social determinants of health). The epidemic of kidney disease currently affects 13% of U.S. adults, and the progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) affects minorities disparately. African-Americans and Hispanics are the fastest growing groups in the ESRD population. Despite well-documented disparities in progression of advanced kidney disease to ESRD, no studies have evaluated the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or early kidney function decline in the US across racial/ethnic groups. It is unknown whether certain racial/ethnic groups have an increased genetic predisposition due to a common genetic ancestry or whether social or environ- mental factors explain observed differences. Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), Dr. Peralta will compare rates of kidney function decline and incident CKD across four major racial groups and test possible genetic and sociodemographic mechanisms to explain these differences. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To compare rates of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease across four major racial/ethnic groups (Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese- Americans) using creatinine and cystatin C based measures; Aim 2: To evaluate whether genetic ancestry is an independent predictor of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease within racial groups and to explore gene-environment interactions in kidney function decline and incident kidney; and Aim 3: To evaluate the association of individual and neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics with kidney function decline and incident kidney disease across racial groups.       Relevance: A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in racial/ethnic disparities in kidney function decline at earlier stages of kidney dysfunction could lead to important interventions and prevention strategies in halting this costly epidemic.

"Patient-Oriented Research in Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Neil R. Powe, MD, is Professor of Medicine and Director of the Welch Center at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He holds a joint appointment in the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where he is the Director of the Clinical Epidemiology Program. He is seeking renewal of this Mid-career Award in Patient-oriented Research to enhance his efforts in clinical research in kidney disease and to continue to build the training program in kidney disease research. Dr. Powe has conducted several clinical investigations in nephrology including studies of: etiology (racial disparities in occurrence of ESRD and a randomized clinical trial of low-versus highosmolality contrast media-induced nephrotoxicity); diagnosis (comparison of physical examination with color flow doppler for detection of vascular access failure); therapy (effectiveness of recombinant human erythropoietin for treatment of anemia of ESRD); and prognosis (incidence, risk factors and prognosis of septicemia and comorbid cardiovascular disease in ESRD patients); and determinants of health disparities. Dr. Powe directs the Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for ESRD (CHOICE) study. This is a national prospective cohort study comparing treatment and outcomes in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. The study has 1041 patients enrolled, making it one of the largest and most representative prospective cohorts of dialysis patients ever studied in the U.S. Data on medical history, laboratory studies, comorbidity and severity of disease and clinical outcomes are being collected. The study has also established a specimen bank which provides opportunities for examining mechanisms for the consequences of kidney disease or its treatment. Ethnic minorities make up a disproportionate share of the population with ESRD. Dr. Powe would like to extend his work into understanding the biologic, clinical and behavioral determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease. Dr. Powe has mentored a cadre of trainees and junior faculty in clinical research in kidney disease. Renewal of this award will permit Dr. Powe to make an even greater contribution to patient-oriented research in nephrology, amplifying his efforts and helping him produce future clinical scientists who are rigorously prepared to become independent investigators in kidney disease research.

"Racial Differences in Phosphorus Metabolism in Health and in Kidney Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Candidate: Orlando Gutierrez received his MD from the University of Toledo, and completed his Internal Medicine Residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is currently a clinical and research fellow in nephrology at MGH, and a candidate for a Master's degree in human physiological investigation from Harvard Medical School. Mentor: Dr. David Nathan is a renowned clinical investigator who has trained numerous investigators in patient-oriented clinical research. Dr. Nathan will ensure the success of Dr. Gutierrez's research training, project, and overall career development. Research: Blacks with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progress to end stage renal disease and develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) more rapidly than Whites. The mechanisms that underlie these disparities remain elusive. Hyperphosphatemia is linked with both accelerated kidney and CVD progression. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) are the primary hormones that regulate serum phosphate (Pi) levels. Preliminary data from our group indicate that Blacks with CKD have a higher prevalence of hyperphosphatemia than Whites at all levels of glomerular filtration rate despite higher PTH levels, suggesting that Blacks have impaired Pi excreting capacity. Impaired Pi excretion may represent a novel risk factor for faster kidney and CV disease progression in Blacks. However, no studies have examined differences in Pi handling by race. For Aim 1, we will examine racial differences in gut and renal Pi handling by measuring (1) gut Pi absorption after a fixed Pi meal and (2) dynamic changes in urinary Pi excretion in response to oral Pi loading in healthy Blacks vs. Whites. For Aim 2, we will examine racial differences in hormonal reguation of Pi metabolism by comparing (1) the phosphaturic effect of synthetic PTH infusion and (2) dynamic changes in FGF-23 levels after oral Pi loading in healthy Blacks vs. Whites. For Aim 3, we will examine racial differences in Pi handling in CKD by measuring urinary Pi excretion in response to dietary Pi loading in Blacks vs. Whites with CKD. We will then compare any differences in CKD to those seen in healthy individuals. We believe the results of these studies will provide critical new insights into racial differences in Pi metabolism that may help elucidate racial disparities in CKD outcomes with important public health implications. A K23 award will allow Dr. Gutierrez to attain new skills in clinical investigation and develop into an independent clinical investigator.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We believe the results of these studies will provide critical new insights into racial differences in serum phosphate metabolism that may help elucidate racial disparities in chronic kidney disease outcomes with important public health implications.                ",Racial Differences in Phosphorus Metabolism in Health and in Kidney Disease,7666183,K23DK081673,"['Epidemic ', ' Cyclic AMP ', ' cAMP ', "" adenosine 3'5' monophosphate "", "" Adenosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogen phosphate) "", ' Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', "" Adenosine Cyclic 3',5'-Monophosphate "", "" 3'5'-cyclic ester of AMP "", ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' urinary ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' General Hospitals ', ' human PTH protein ', ' human parathyroid hormone ', ' hPTH(1-84) ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Excretory function ', ' excretion ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nephrons ', ' Uriniferous Tube ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Hormonal ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' phosphorus metabolism ', ' success ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' absorption ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' hormone regulation ', ' hormonal regulation ', ' Accounting ', ' feeding ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' fibroblast growth factor 23 ', ' FGF23 gene product ', ' Parathyroid Hormones ', ' parathormone ', ' Parathyroid Hormone (1-84) ', ' PTH (1-84) ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Diet ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Dietary intake ', ' training project ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2009,137160,0.07164340455961171
"Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans are less likely than Whites to receive kidney transplants, despite their being more than two-fold as likely as Whites to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD). Living related kidney donation (LD) offers patients an opportunity to bypass many barriers to receipt of deceased kidney transplants (e.g. waiting lists and immunological incompatibility), but minorities are less likely to receive living related kidney transplants (LRT). Evidence suggests African Americans may not discuss LD/LRT with their families or physicians at optimal rates, and thus may not have adequate information to initiate or participate in shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT. African Americans may also have financial concerns regarding convalescence and out of pocket expenses related to LD/LRT, another barrier impeding LD/LRT.   The primary goals of this study are to overcome these important barriers by enhancing ethnic minorities' consideration of LD/LRT through the promotion of shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT and provision of financial assistance for out of pocket expenses. Our specific aims are: a) to develop culturally sensitive informational (audiovisual) and financial interventions and b) to perform a randomized controlled trial to assess their effectiveness in increasing pursuit of LD/LRT among African American patients with ESRD and their families. We will conduct focus groups to refine the content/delivery of the informational (audiovisual) intervention to promote patient and family shared-decision making and design a written brochure describing the financial assistance (for work loss, childcare and travel costs) intervention. We will enroll 210 adult African American patients with new-onset ESRD from 4 sites (9 dialysis facilities) in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment to pursue LD/LRT (using the Transtheoretical Model for stages of behavior change). Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1) informational incentive alone, 2) informational intervention plus financial assistance, and 3) no intervention (usual care). We will follow participants for up to 12 months for progression in their commitment to LD/LRT (precontemplation stage to contemplation stage to preparation stage to action stage to completion stage (receipt of LD/LRT)). If the interventions are successful in activating patients and their families to consider and undergo LD/LRT, we will disseminate them widely. Effective interventions to improve rates of LD/LRT in African Americans could help eliminate large disparities in receipt of organs for ESRD. The substantial experience of our team in the design and conduct of behavioral, epidemiologic and interventional studies related to donor/recipient health, minority health and kidney disease provides a strong foundation for this research.

"Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Blacks are disproportionately affected by kidney disease, exhibiting high rates of age-adjusted incident CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and more rapid progression to end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular disease. Prior studies in this area have been limited by the use of creatinine-based measures of kidney function that may mask early kidney disease (declines in kidney function at GFR e 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and by the absence of longitudinal data on cohorts with adequate numbers of Black participants and no prevalent disease at baseline. We propose to combine repeated measurements of cystatin C, a marker of kidney function, with longitudinal data on risk factor and cardiovascular disease development in the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort.  Cystatin C may offer advantages over creatinine-based estimates of kidney function for detecting early declines in function. CARDIA offers a cohort of 5115 young adults with similar numbers of Blacks and Whites and of men and women, who at baseline were aged 18-30 and free of cardiovascular disease. After 20 years of follow-up, Black CARDIA participants (compared with Whites) have 2-fold higher rates of hypertension, 4-fold higher rates of kidney dysfunction, and 10-fold higher rates of heart failure, making this cohort ideal for exploring factors that place Blacks at particular risk for these processes. We will: (1) evaluate declines in kidney function, hypothesizing (a) a greater decline in Blacks that is mediated by hypertension, socioeconomic factors, and inflammation, and (b) that cystatin C will be more sensitive than creatinine-based estimates for detecting declines in kidney function at GFR = 60 ml/min/1.73 m2; (2) determine the association between declining kidney function and subsequent sub-clinical cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing (a) that cystatin C will be a stronger predictor than creatinine-based estimates of GFR or microalbuminuria, and (b) that cystatin C will predict carotid wall thickness more strongly in Blacks, but will predict coronary artery calcium more strongly in Whites; (3) determine the association between declining kidney function and subsequent cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing that cystatin C will be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than creatinine-based estimates of kidney function.

"Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans African Americans are less likely than Whites to receive kidney transplants, despite their being more than two-fold as likely as Whites to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD). Living related ddney donation (LD) offers patients an opportunity to bypass many barriers to receipt of deceased kidney transplants (e.g. waiting lists and immunological incompatibility), but minorities are less likely to receive living related kidney transplants (LRT). Evidence suggests African Americans may not discuss LD/LRT with their families or physicians at optimal rates, and thus may not have adequate information :o initiate or participate in shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT. African Americans may also  lave financial concerns regarding convalescence and out of pocket expenses related to LD/LRT, another barrier impeding LD/LRT.  The primary goals of this study are to overcome these important barriers by enhancing ethnic minorities' consideration of LD/LRT through the promotion of shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT and provision of financial assistance for out of pocket expenses. Our specific aims are: a) to develop culturally sensitive informational (audiovisual) and financial interventions and b) to perform a  ¿andomized controlled trial to assess their effectiveness in increasing pursuit of LD/LRT among African American patients with ESRD and their families. We will conduct focus groups to refine the content/delivery of the informational (audiovisual) intervention to promote patient and family shared- decision making and design a written brochure describing the financial assistance (for work loss, childcare and travel costs) intervention. We will enroll 210 adult African American patients with new- onset ESRD from 4 sites (9 dialysis facilities) in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment to pursue LD/LRT (using the Transtheoretical Model for stages of behavior change). Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1) informational incentive alone, 2) informational intervention plus financial assistance, and 3) no intervention (usual care). We will follow participants for up to 12 months for progression in their commitment to LD/LRT (precontemplation stage to contemplation stage to preparation stage to action stage to completion stage (receipt of LD/LRT)). If the interventions are successful in activating patients and their families to consider and undergo LD/LRT, we will disseminate them widely. Effective interventions to improve  rates of LD/LRT in African Americans could help eliminate large disparities in receipt of organs for  ESRD. The substantial experience of our team in the design and conduct of behavioral, epidemiologic and interventional studies related to donor/recipient health, minority health and kidney  disease provides a strong foundation for this research.

"Understanding Race and Culture in Living Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive kidney transplants, the optimal treatment for ESRD. Race disparities exist in the (a) overall rate of transplantation; (b) type of transplant received [i.e., deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) versus living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT)]; and, (c) early post-transplant health outcomes. One of the best ways to reduce racial disparities in transplantation may be to increase the rate of LDKT among AAs. Although it is known that LDKT is the optimal treatment for ESRD, and that AAs receive LDKTs at much lower rates than whites, the reasons for this disparity among patients already referred for transplant are poorly understood. Further, even among the group of patients who receive LDKT, race disparities in early post- transplant health outcomes persist. Known biological differences associated with race (e.g., presensitization or heightened immune response, donor co-morbid health conditions) do not fully explain the observed racial disparities. Thus, the central goals of this prospective cohort study are to understand (a) the culturally-related and psychosocial factors associated with race disparities in LDKT, and (b) the relationship of those factors with early post-transplant health outcomes in a sample of AA and white transplant candidates. The proposed project will take an interdisciplinary approach in developing a bio-psychosocial model to understand race disparities in LDKT. It will control for demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, SES), and physical health factors (e.g., physical health, co-morbidities, post-transplant adherence) in order to understand the role of culturally-related factors (e.g., medical mistrust, perceived racism and discrimination, religious beliefs, family networks), transplant related beliefs (e.g., knowledge, decision-making factors, transplant attitudes) and psychosocial factors (e.g., depression/anxiety, social support, coping strategies) on race disparities in LDKT. This prospective cohort study will assess patients (n=1775) at two critical time points leading to transplantation (pre-transplant work-up and completion of transplant evaluation), and at 6 months post-transplant. Predictor variables will be assessed via telephone interview at pre-transplant work-up. Whether or not patients completed transplant evaluation will be assessed at the second time-point through medical record abstraction, and patients' perspective of the quantity and quality of interactions with transplant staff will be assessed with a follow-up interview after transplant evaluation is completed. Finally, type of transplant received as well as early post-transplant health outcomes will be assessed using a final follow-up telephone interview, and additional medical record abstraction. Findings from this study are an essential step toward the long-term goal of developing patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post- transplant health outcomes among African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESRD. Because known biological differences do not fully explain the observed racial disparities, this project will examine how culturally-related factors are associated with barriers and facilitators to LDKT and subsequent early post-transplant health outcomes.

"Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Blacks are disproportionately affected by kidney disease, exhibiting high rates of age-adjusted incident CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and more rapid progression to end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular disease. Prior studies in this area have been limited by the use of creatinine-based measures of kidney function that may mask early kidney disease (declines in kidney function at GFR e 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and by the absence of longitudinal data on cohorts with adequate numbers of Black participants and no prevalent disease at baseline. We propose to combine repeated measurements of cystatin C, a marker of kidney function, with longitudinal data on risk factor and cardiovascular disease development in the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort.  Cystatin C may offer advantages over creatinine-based estimates of kidney function for detecting early declines in function. CARDIA offers a cohort of 5115 young adults with similar numbers of Blacks and Whites and of men and women, who at baseline were aged 18-30 and free of cardiovascular disease. After 20 years of follow-up, Black CARDIA participants (compared with Whites) have 2-fold higher rates of hypertension, 4-fold higher rates of kidney dysfunction, and 10-fold higher rates of heart failure, making this cohort ideal for exploring factors that place Blacks at particular risk for these processes. We will: (1) evaluate declines in kidney function, hypothesizing (a) a greater decline in Blacks that is mediated by hypertension, socioeconomic factors, and inflammation, and (b) that cystatin C will be more sensitive than creatinine-based estimates for detecting declines in kidney function at GFR = 60 ml/min/1.73 m2; (2) determine the association between declining kidney function and subsequent sub-clinical cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing (a) that cystatin C will be a stronger predictor than creatinine-based estimates of GFR or microalbuminuria, and (b) that cystatin C will predict carotid wall thickness more strongly in Blacks, but will predict coronary artery calcium more strongly in Whites; (3) determine the association between declining kidney function and subsequent cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing that cystatin C will be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than creatinine-based estimates of kidney function. The results of this epidemiologic study will provide important insights into the timing of CKD development in young to middle-aged people and the relative importance of various risk factors in kidney function decline and cardiovascular risk. These findings will be important as a guide for preventive efforts and future research, particularly in Blacks.          ",Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Young Adults,7600593,R01DK078124,"['Creatinine ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Cysteine Proteinase Antagonists ', ' Cysteine Protease Inhibitors ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Masks ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Participant ', ' post gamma-globulins ', ' post-gamma-protein ', ' cystatin C ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Microalbuminuria ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complication ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' intima media ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' high risk ', ' longitudinal design ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,308044,0.1134539232891877
"A Randomized Trial and Reduce to Disparity in Live Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans comprise a higher percentage of the waiting list for kidney transplantation than would be expected based on population parameters, they wait longer for kidney transplantation, and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT among African Americans with ESRD, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in this patient population. The long-term goal of this research program is to improve education provided to African Americans and, thereby, increase rates of LDKT. The objective of this application is to determine the relative effectiveness of three strategies for increasing LDKT rates in African Americans. The central hypothesis is that a home-based intervention that involves the patient and significant others yields higher LDKT rates in an African American population relative to educational interventions delivered in the transplant center. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the clinical effectiveness of three separate LDKT educational approaches with African American patients; and 2) Determine the sociodemographic, medical, and donation-specific variables that are most strongly associated with pursuing LDKT. One hundred eighty African American adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will be urn randomized to receive one of three educational interventions: home-based (HB), group-based (GB), or standard care (SC). The HB (in the home) and GB (in the transplant center) interventions will provide education to patients and their immediate and extended family members, significant others, and friends. The SC intervention (in the transplant center) mirrors what is currently done at this transplant center and will provide education to individual patients only. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who receive LDKT. Secondary outcomes include live donor inquiries, live donor evaluations, number of potential live donors educated, and LDKT knowledge, concerns, and willingness. Recruitment rates, attrition rates, reasons for nonparticipation and attrition, protocol adherence, and participant satisfaction ratings will be gathered. The proposed research is innovative because it evaluates the relative effectiveness of three educational strategies designed to increase LDKT rates in African Americans. Findings from this study have the potential to close this racial disparity gap by identifying evidence-based educational strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT rates in African Americans.

"Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. L. Ebony Boulware is a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who recently trained in Internal Medicine at University of Maryland Medical Center and completed a fellowship in General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins. She seeks this Mentored Clinical Scientist Award to study why the health burden of CKD is magnified among ethnic/racial minorities. Ethnic/racial disparities in the incidence and prevalence of CKD are striking, with African Americans suffering rates of CKD 4 to 6 times greater than their White counterparts. While some of the excess incidence of ESRD in high-risk populations can be explained by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, much of the excess risk of progression toward ESRD for ethnic minorities remains unexplained.   Building on research experience and skills attained during her fellowship, Dr. Boulware aims to assess potential attitudinal, behavioral, and clinical mechanisms (awareness and perceived susceptibility to disease, adherence, trust and perceived discrimination, patient-physician communication) through which previously unexplained ethnic/racial disparities in CKD could be explained. She will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of participants in a multi-center study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), high-risk African Americans (Jackson Heart Study), and high-risk patients in urban clinical settings (collecting data in her proposed ancillary study to an ongoing NIH/NHLBI-funded randomized controlled trial of persons with hypertension and diabetes in Maryland). Data include medical history, behavioral measures, physical examination measures, and laboratory studies. Analytic methods will include logistic regression, survival analysis, analysis of clustered data, and other longitudinal data analysis techniques.    In addition to experience in the conduct of these studies, Dr. Boulware will enhance her research knowledge and skills through advanced coursework, research team meetings, conferences, and seminars in the supportive and multidisciplinary environment of the Welch Center. This award will provide Dr. Boulware with a foundation to launch her independent research career devoted to understanding the reasons behind ethnic/racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, and in reducing ethnic/racial disparities in CKD.

"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   According to the 2002 U.S. Census, Hispanics are now the nation's largest minority group. There has also been a dramatic rise in the Hispanic end stage renal disease (ESRD) population, with the number of Hispanics on dialysis increasing by more than 70 percent between 1996 and 2001. Further growth of the Hispanic ESRD population is expected in view of the increasing size of the overall Hispanic population, a high prevalence of diabetes, and an increased incidence of ESRD in Hispanics. Despite the magnitude of this problem, little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is one of seven clinical centers for the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, which is an NIH-sponsored multi-centered study investigating risk factors for progression of kidney and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 3,000 participants with CKD. The CRIC Study cohort is 50 percent White and 50 percent Black. This application seeks to establish a sizable cohort of Hispanics with CKD that will be integrated into the overall CRIC Study.

"Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease and Vitamin D: Are they related?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   My goal for this career development award is to become an excellent independent investigator in patient-oriented research in chronic kidney disease progression. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are world-wide epidemics with an estimated 19 million people living with CKD and over 300,000 treated with dialysis in the United States. African-Americans and other minorities are disproportionately affected by ESRD with an incidence rate that is almost fourfold that of whites. Risk factors of initiation and progression of CKD and the factors underlying the racial disparities in ESRD have not been fully elucidated. Vitamin D has anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory properties and functions as an endocrine regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. As such, low levels of vitamin D are a potential novel risk factor for progression of CKD. In addition, African-Americans and Hispanics in the United States have lower vitamin D levels than whites, making differences in vitamin D a possible contributor to the differential CKD progression between African-Americans, Hispanics and whites. The first part of my research proposal will use data from the Women's Health Initiative to explore the factors underlying the differences in vitamin D levels between AA and whites. I will then use data from the NHANES III mortality and Medicare linkages to assess associations between low vitamin D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality and incident ESRD. If these associations exist, I will then evaluate whether differences in vitamin D levels may explain the racial disparities in ESRD. My third aim will be to conduct a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D repletion in a multi-ethnic population with CKD, vitamin D deficient and albuminuria to evaluate correction of vitamin D levels, and reductions in albuminuria and blood pressure. I have already proven my commitment and ability to become a successful clinical investigator by obtaining a Master's degree in Clinical Epidemiology and obtaining independent funding as a nephrology fellow through an individual NRSA. This K23 grant will allow me to develop my career through advanced formal coursework, intensive mentoring and the design, planning and conduct of a randomized clinical trial.       ",Racial

"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   According to the 2002 U.S. Census, Hispanics are now the nation's largest minority group. There has also been a dramatic rise in the Hispanic end stage renal disease (ESRD) population, with the number of Hispanics on dialysis increasing by more than 70 percent between 1996 and 2001. Further growth of the Hispanic ESRD population is expected in view of the increasing size of the overall Hispanic population, a high prevalence of diabetes, and an increased incidence of ESRD in Hispanics. Despite the magnitude of this problem, little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is one of seven clinical centers for the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, which is an NIH-sponsored multi-centered study investigating risk factors for progression of kidney and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 3,000 participants with CKD. The CRIC Study cohort is 50 percent White and 50 percent Black. This application seeks to establish a sizable cohort of Hispanics with CKD that will be integrated into the overall CRIC Study. The overall aims of this application are:   1. To determine predictors of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKD.   2. To compare rates of progression of kidney disease and subclinical CVD in Hispanics with CKD with those seen in non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks.   3. To improve the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) prediction equations in Hispanics with CKD.

"Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. L. Ebony Boulware is a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who recently trained in Internal Medicine at University of Maryland Medical Center and completed a fellowship in General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins. She seeks this Mentored Clinical Scientist Award to study why the health burden of CKD is magnified among ethnic/racial minorities. Ethnic/racial disparities in the incidence and prevalence of CKD are striking, with African Americans suffering rates of CKD 4 to 6 times greater than their White counterparts. While some of the excess incidence of ESRD in high-risk populations can be explained by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, much of the excess risk of progression toward ESRD for ethnic minorities remains unexplained.   Building on research experience and skills attained during her fellowship, Dr. Boulware aims to assess potential attitudinal, behavioral, and clinical mechanisms (awareness and perceived susceptibility to disease, adherence, trust and perceived discrimination, patient-physician communication) through which previously unexplained ethnic/racial disparities in CKD could be explained. She will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of participants in a multi-center study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), high-risk African Americans (Jackson Heart Study), and high-risk patients in urban clinical settings (collecting data in her proposed ancillary study to an ongoing NIH/NHLBI-funded randomized controlled trial of persons with hypertension and diabetes in Maryland). Data include medical history, behavioral measures, physical examination measures, and laboratory studies. Analytic methods will include logistic regression, survival analysis, analysis of clustered data, and other longitudinal data analysis techniques.    In addition to experience in the conduct of these studies, Dr. Boulware will enhance her research knowledge and skills through advanced coursework, research team meetings, conferences, and seminars in the supportive and multidisciplinary environment of the Welch Center. This award will provide Dr. Boulware with a foundation to launch her independent research career devoted to understanding the reasons behind ethnic/racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, and in reducing ethnic/racial disparities in CKD.       ",Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities,7677396,K23DK070757,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award (K23) ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart ', ' Hostility ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' racism ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Incidence ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Maryland ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Morbidity -

"Social Networks and Pathways to Transplant Parity for Black Hemodialysis Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to address critical gaps in the scientific knowledge on kidney transplant disparity in the United States, and establish a program of meritorious research related to this public health problem at the University of South Carolina College of Social Work. Research has shown that black End Stage Renal Disease patients are significantly less likely than their white peers to be evaluated and listed for a kidney transplant, and a significant portion of this disparity remains unexplained. This project will explore the hypothesis that black hemodialysis patients' lack of access to social contacts with useful information about kidney transplantation may hinder information transaction regarding the benefits of, and pathway to, kidney transplantation. To answer the research questions a) What is the role of the various types of social networks in providing information about kidney transplantation to black hemodialysis patients?, and b) What is the relationship between this information transaction and a patient's likelihood of being placed on a kidney transplant waiting list?, the proposal will meet the following aims: 1) To describe black hemodialysis patients' knowledge about how to get a kidney transplant, and 2) To determine the association between black hemodialysis patients' knowledge and understanding about how to get a kidney transplant, black hemodialysis patients' social network composition, and the likelihood that these patients are listed for a kidney transplant. As this proposal meets the goals of the AREA research program to support meritorious research, strengthen the institution's research environment, and expose students to research, the final aim of this research will be 3) To further undergraduate and graduate education at the University of South Carolina College of Social Work by establishing a funded program of meritorious research on the pathways to kidney transplant parity and including students in all aspects of the research. The project aims will be achieved through a cross-sectional survey of black hemodialysis patients age 18-65 within 90 miles of Columbia, SC. The proposed study is novel because it uses a unique conceptual model involving the social network relationships of black hemodialysis patients to explain a portion of kidney transplant disparity. The project is also significant because the knowledge gained can provide suggestions for subsequent interventions that aim to ameloriate the public health problem of kidney transplant disparity. Furthermore, this project will provide a unique training environment for undergraduate and graduate students to advance their careers in health research. This project can provide information to dialysis teams and other researchers that can be used to improve interdisciplinary patient care mandated by the Medicare Conditions for Coverage. The results of this project will be disseminated broadly through publications and presentations, both locally and nationally, that involve the participation of the undergraduate and graduate student assistants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the United States, black hemodialysis patients are significantly less likely than white patients to be evaluated and listed for a kidney transplant. Using a unique conceptual model, this project will explore the role of black hemodialysis patients' social relationships in providing patients with information about how to get a kidney transplant. The results from this study can help practitioners improve the care they provide to help black hemodialysis patients get kidney transplants, and can suggest future research that studies related interventions that can help address this public health problem.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Title: Social Networks and Pathways to Transplant Parity for Black Hemodialysis Patients In the United States, black hemodialysis patients are significantly less likely than white patients to be evaluated and listed for a kidney transplant.

"A Randomized Trial and Reduce to Disparity in Live Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans comprise a higher percentage of the waiting list for kidney transplantation than would be expected based on population parameters, they wait longer for kidney transplantation, and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT among African Americans with ESRD, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in this patient population. The long-term goal of this research program is to improve education provided to African Americans and, thereby, increase rates of LDKT. The objective of this application is to determine the relative effectiveness of three strategies for increasing LDKT rates in African Americans. The central hypothesis is that a home-based intervention that involves the patient and significant others yields higher LDKT rates in an African American population relative to educational interventions delivered in the transplant center. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the clinical effectiveness of three separate LDKT educational approaches with African American patients; and 2) Determine the sociodemographic, medical, and donation-specific variables that are most strongly associated with pursuing LDKT. One hundred eighty African American adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will be urn randomized to receive one of three educational interventions: home-based (HB), group-based (GB), or standard care (SC). The HB (in the home) and GB (in the transplant center) interventions will provide education to patients and their immediate and extended family members, significant others, and friends. The SC intervention (in the transplant center) mirrors what is currently done at this transplant center and will provide education to individual patients only. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who receive LDKT. Secondary outcomes include live donor inquiries, live donor evaluations, number of potential live donors educated, and LDKT knowledge, concerns, and willingness. Recruitment rates, attrition rates, reasons for nonparticipation and attrition, protocol adherence, and participant satisfaction ratings will be gathered. The proposed research is innovative because it evaluates the relative effectiveness of three educational strategies designed to increase LDKT rates in African Americans. Findings from this study have the potential to close this racial disparity gap by identifying evidence-based educational strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT rates in African Americans. This proposal directly addresses three of the priority areas of HealthyPeople2010 (4-1, 4-5, 4-6).

"Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. L. Ebony Boulware is a junior faculty member in the Department of Medicine and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who recently trained in Internal Medicine at University of Maryland Medical Center and completed a fellowship in General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins. She seeks this Mentored Clinical Scientist Award to study why the health burden of CKD is magnified among ethnic/racial minorities. Ethnic/racial disparities in the incidence and prevalence of CKD are striking, with African Americans suffering rates of CKD 4 to 6 times greater than their White counterparts. While some of the excess incidence of ESRD in high-risk populations can be explained by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, much of the excess risk of progression toward ESRD for ethnic minorities remains unexplained.   Building on research experience and skills attained during her fellowship, Dr. Boulware aims to assess potential attitudinal, behavioral, and clinical mechanisms (awareness and perceived susceptibility to disease, adherence, trust and perceived discrimination, patient-physician communication) through which previously unexplained ethnic/racial disparities in CKD could be explained. She will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of participants in a multi-center study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), high-risk African Americans (Jackson Heart Study), and high-risk patients in urban clinical settings (collecting data in her proposed ancillary study to an ongoing NIH/NHLBI-funded randomized controlled trial of persons with hypertension and diabetes in Maryland). Data include medical history, behavioral measures, physical examination measures, and laboratory studies. Analytic methods will include logistic regression, survival analysis, analysis of clustered data, and other longitudinal data analysis techniques.    In addition to experience in the conduct of these studies, Dr. Boulware will enhance her research knowledge and skills through advanced coursework, research team meetings, conferences, and seminars in the supportive and multidisciplinary environment of the Welch Center. This award will provide Dr. Boulware with a foundation to launch her independent research career devoted to understanding the reasons behind ethnic/racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, and in reducing ethnic/racial disparities in CKD.       ",Clinical and Behavioral Determinants  of CKD Disparities,7923168,K23DK070757,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award (K23) ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart ', ' Hostility ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' racism ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Incidence ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Maryland ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Morbidity -

"Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Blacks are disproportionately affected by kidney disease, exhibiting high rates of age-adjusted incident CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and more rapid progression to end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular disease. Prior studies in this area have been limited by the use of creatinine-based measures of kidney function that may mask early kidney disease (declines in kidney function at GFR e 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and by the absence of longitudinal data on cohorts with adequate numbers of Black participants and no prevalent disease at baseline. We propose to combine repeated measurements of cystatin C, a marker of kidney function, with longitudinal data on risk factor and cardiovascular disease development in the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort.  Cystatin C may offer advantages over creatinine-based estimates of kidney function for detecting early declines in function. CARDIA offers a cohort of 5115 young adults with similar numbers of Blacks and Whites and of men and women, who at baseline were aged 18-30 and free of cardiovascular disease. After 20 years of follow-up, Black CARDIA participants (compared with Whites) have 2-fold higher rates of hypertension, 4-fold higher rates of kidney dysfunction, and 10-fold higher rates of heart failure, making this cohort ideal for exploring factors that place Blacks at particular risk for these processes. We will: (1) evaluate declines in kidney function, hypothesizing (a) a greater decline in Blacks that is mediated by hypertension, socioeconomic factors, and inflammation, and (b) that cystatin C will be more sensitive than creatinine-based estimates for detecting declines in kidney function at GFR = 60 ml/min/1.73 m2; (2) determine the association between declining kidney function and subsequent sub-clinical cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing (a) that cystatin C will be a stronger predictor than creatinine-based estimates of GFR or microalbuminuria, and (b) that cystatin C will predict carotid wall thickness more strongly in Blacks, but will predict coronary artery calcium more strongly in Whites; (3) determine the association between declining kidney function and subsequent cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing that cystatin C will be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than creatinine-based estimates of kidney function. The results of this epidemiologic study will provide important insights into the timing of CKD development in young to middle-aged people and the relative importance of various risk factors in kidney function decline and cardiovascular risk.

"Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans are less likely than Whites to receive kidney transplants, despite their being more than two-fold as likely as Whites to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD). Living related kidney donation (LD) offers patients an opportunity to bypass many barriers to receipt of deceased kidney transplants (e.g. waiting lists and immunological incompatibility), but minorities are less likely to receive living related kidney transplants (LRT). Evidence suggests African Americans may not discuss LD/LRT with their families or physicians at optimal rates, and thus may not have adequate information to initiate or participate in shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT. African Americans may also have financial concerns regarding convalescence and out of pocket expenses related to LD/LRT, another barrier impeding LD/LRT.   The primary goals of this study are to overcome these important barriers by enhancing ethnic minorities' consideration of LD/LRT through the promotion of shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT and provision of financial assistance for out of pocket expenses. Our specific aims are: a) to develop culturally sensitive informational (audiovisual) and financial interventions and b) to perform a randomized controlled trial to assess their effectiveness in increasing pursuit of LD/LRT among African American patients with ESRD and their families. We will conduct focus groups to refine the content/delivery of the informational (audiovisual) intervention to promote patient and family shared-decision making and design a written brochure describing the financial assistance (for work loss, childcare and travel costs) intervention. We will enroll 210 adult African American patients with new-onset ESRD from 4 sites (9 dialysis facilities) in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment to pursue LD/LRT (using the Transtheoretical Model for stages of behavior change). Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1) informational incentive alone, 2) informational intervention plus financial assistance, and 3) no intervention (usual care). We will follow participants for up to 12 months for progression in their commitment to LD/LRT (precontemplation stage to contemplation stage to preparation stage to action stage to completion stage (receipt of LD/LRT)). If the interventions are successful in activating patients and their families to consider and undergo LD/LRT, we will disseminate them widely. Effective interventions to improve rates of LD/LRT in African Americans could help eliminate large disparities in receipt of organs for ESRD. The substantial experience of our team in the design and conduct of behavioral, epidemiologic and interventional studies related to donor/recipient health, minority health and kidney disease provides a strong foundation for this research.       ",Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans,7903181,R01DK079682,"['Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Audiovisual Material ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Organ ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' minority health ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Individual ', ' Persons ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Travel ', ' Attitude ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Baltimore ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Bypass ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' effective intervention ', ' successful intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' shared decision making ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Convalescence ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,226737,0.05657686918273709
"Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease and Vitamin D: Are they related?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   My goal for this career development award is to become an excellent independent investigator in patient-oriented research in chronic kidney disease progression. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are world-wide epidemics with an estimated 19 million people living with CKD and over 300,000 treated with dialysis in the United States. African-Americans and other minorities are disproportionately affected by ESRD with an incidence rate that is almost fourfold that of whites. Risk factors of initiation and progression of CKD and the factors underlying the racial disparities in ESRD have not been fully elucidated. Vitamin D has anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory properties and functions as an endocrine regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. As such, low levels of vitamin D are a potential novel risk factor for progression of CKD. In addition, African-Americans and Hispanics in the United States have lower vitamin D levels than whites, making differences in vitamin D a possible contributor to the differential CKD progression between African-Americans, Hispanics and whites. The first part of my research proposal will use data from the Women's Health Initiative to explore the factors underlying the differences in vitamin D levels between AA and whites. I will then use data from the NHANES III mortality and Medicare linkages to assess associations between low vitamin D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality and incident ESRD. If these associations exist, I will then evaluate whether differences in vitamin D levels may explain the racial disparities in ESRD. My third aim will be to conduct a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D repletion in a multi-ethnic population with CKD, vitamin D deficient and albuminuria to evaluate correction of vitamin D levels, and reductions in albuminuria and blood pressure. I have already proven my commitment and ability to become a successful clinical investigator by obtaining a Master's degree in Clinical Epidemiology and obtaining independent funding as a nephrology fellow through an individual NRSA. This K23 grant will allow me to develop my career through advanced formal coursework, intensive mentoring and the design, planning and conduct of a randomized clinical trial.       ",Racial

Purnell is a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a research trainee at the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research. She seeks this National Research Service Award (NRSA) Training Grant to support her career development with the goal of becoming a successful independent clinical researcher studying ways to address ethnic/racial health disparities for patients with chronic kidney disease. During this award, Ms. Purnell will pursue rigorous research and didactic training in a program designed to provide a strong foundation for her future career. In her research, she will examine ethnic/racial differences in attitudes regarding economic risks of live kidney donation, determine whether ethnic/racial differences in attitudes are associated with ethnic/race differences in willingness to donate, and she will assess the impact of federal and state policy interventions addressing economic barriers to live donation upon ethnic/racial differences in live kidney donation rates. Additionally, she will assess whether access to enabling resources (including income/wealth, health insurance, and occupational prestige) explain the relation of ethnic/race differences in attitudes toward economic risks and ethnic/race differences in willingness to donate. To accomplish these aims, she will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of living kidney donation attitudes and behaviors in the United States, utilizing complex weighted survey data obtained from regional and national studies of persons in the general public and by creating a national dataset of living kidney donors utilizing publicly available data from several sources. She will employ regression analyses, multiple-time series analyses, and other longitudinal analysis techniques in these studies. Ms. Purnell's research objectives are closely aligned with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases end-stage renal disease target focus of improving rates of kidney transplantation and donation, particularly by African Americans and other ethnic/racial minority groups. In her didactic program, Ms. Purnell will take advanced coursework in research methods, including advanced techniques in study design and analysis, grant writing, and research ethics. Through attendance at national meetings as well as several advanced research seminars, held in the supportive training environment at the Welch Center, she will also have the opportunity to observe the work of others and present her own work. She has identified a team of experienced faculty mentors who are committed to supporting her success and who will make sure she has the resources to assure her completion of the proposed aims of this application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My primary career goal is to become a successful independent health services and policy researcher whose work directly contributes to improving health outcomes and reducing disparities in measures of access and quality for patients with chronic kidney disease.

"Exploring factors influencing gender disparities in access to transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the modern era, kidney transplantation is a safe and effective treatment for many patients with kidney failure. However, choosing the right patients for kidney transplantation is difficult, especially among older patients. Although older patients who receive transplants survive longer than if they had stayed on dialysis, still very few older patients are placed on the transplant waiting list. This is because no tools exist for determining risk in older patients undergoing transplantation, so clinical decision making has to be based on subjective perceptions of a patient's strength and reserve. Misclassification of these factors by the patient or provider likely results in decreased access to transplantation in a population that stands to greatly benefit from this treatment.  Although transplant outcomes and survival benefit are similar in men and women, it has been well established that women have significantly less access to transplantation than men. We recently showed that this disparity is strongest in older patients, with older women having 30-60% less access than their male counterparts. However, it remains unclear whether patient or provider level factors contribute to this disparity. In this study we will explore differences by gender and age in factors influencing a patient's decision and ability to pursue transplantation. We will then use a new technique to explore the potential role of gender and age biases in a provider's choice to refer a patient for transplantation. Understanding the root causes of this gender/age disparity is crucial to developing interventions to improve access to transplantation, and healthcare in general, for women and older adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although kidney transplantation is safe, effective, and life-extending for many patients, women have significantly less access to transplantation than their male counterparts, and we have shown that this disparity is widest among older women compared with older men. It is unknown whether this happens because of patient-level barriers to seeking transplantation or because of provider-level biases against referral of women compared with men. Since over 50% of dialysis patients are over the age of 65, equal access to transplantation for this subgroup is important; the goal of this project is to explore potential sources of the gender disparity in access to transplantation, and access to healthcare in general, so that interventions to minimize this disparity can be designed.           Public Health Relevance Although kidney transplantation is safe, effective, and life-extending for many patients, women have significantly less access to transplantation than their male counterparts, and we have shown that this disparity is widest among older women compared with older men.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are world-wide epidemics with an estimated 19 million people living with CKD and over 300,000 treated with dialysis in the United States. African-Americans and other minorities are disproportionately affected by ESRD with an incidence rate that is almost fourfold that of whites. Risk factors of initiation and progression of CKD and the factors underlying the racial disparities in ESRD have not been fully elucidated. Vitamin D has anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory properties and functions as an endocrine regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. As such, low levels of vitamin D are a potential novel risk factor for progression of CKD. In addition, African-Americans and Hispanics in the United States have lower vitamin D levels than whites, making differences in vitamin D a possible contributor to the differential CKD progression between African-Americans, Hispanics and whites. The first part of my research proposal will use data from the Women's Health Initiative to explore the factors underlying the differences in vitamin D levels between AA and whites. I will then use data from the NHANES III mortality and Medicare linkages to assess associations between low vitamin D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality and incident ESRD. If these associations exist, I will then evaluate whether differences in vitamin D levels may explain the racial disparities in ESRD. My third aim will be to conduct a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D repletion in a multi-ethnic population with CKD, vitamin D deficient and albuminuria to evaluate correction of vitamin D levels, and reductions in albuminuria and blood pressure. I have already proven my commitment and ability to become a successful clinical investigator by obtaining a Master's degree in Clinical Epidemiology and obtaining independent funding as a nephrology fellow through an individual NRSA. This K23 grant will allow me to develop my career through advanced formal coursework, intensive mentoring and the design, planning and conduct of a randomized clinical trial.

"Association among serum perfluroalkyl chemicals,chronic kidney disease and cardio    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a population-based study to examine the relation of blood levels of perfluroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) to the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in two separate studies in a population-based sample of Appalachian adults. We are requesting funding for secondary analysis of data. This proposal takes advantage of the data on exposures and outcomes already gathered on a population-based cross-sectional sample of 56,554 Appalachian adults who were aged e18 years and 53% of whom were women, residing in six communities in Ohio and West Virginia, called the C8 Health Study. In the study, we have data available on serum PFC levels, the main exposure of interest, on all members of the cohort, including serum levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS or C8s), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA or C8), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS or C6S), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA or C6), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA or C5), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA or C7), perfluorononaoic acid (PFNA or C9), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA or C10), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA or C11), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA or C12) as part of a previous court-mandated health survey. We also have available pertinent data that will enable us to define CKD and CVD, the main outcomes of interest. This includes serum creatinine measurement that is available on all study subjects, enabling us to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. We will define CKD as an eGFR of <60 mL/min per 1.73 meter2, consistent with current guidelines. We also have data on validated, physician diagnosed CVD, including coronary heart disease and stroke. We will examine the putative association between serum PFCs and the outcomes of interest (CKD or CVD) employing standard epidemiological techniques, including multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, gender, race- ethnicity, education, body mass index, and other confounders. Our study provides a unique and cost-effective opportunity to assess the independent association between serum PFC and the presence of CVD and CKD in a large community-based cohort in Appalachia, which is a designated health disparity population. Data from our study will improve the understanding of the health effects of PFCs on humans. Results from the current study will also guide the planning of future follow-up studies of the same cohort population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Perfluroalkyl chemicals (PFC) are detectable in the blood of >98% of S adults. We will study the association between blood PFCs and kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. If we find an association, it indirectly suggests that reducing PFCs may have a role in preventing these diseases.              Perfluroalkyl chemicals (PFC) are detectable in the blood of >98% of US adults.

"Engaging Communities and Institutions to Reduce Health Disparities in Cleveland Cleveland is characterized by an extremely high poverty rate, substantial numbers of racial/ethnic minorities, and marked health disparities. We propose to engage Cleveland's health care providers, educational institutions, community organizations, and government agencies to understand and reduce health disparities.  To take advantage of pre-existing community and institutional strengths, we will focus initially on 3 interrelated prototypical conditions: hypertension, kidney disease, and transplantation. These conditions affect many individuals and have some of the most striking health disparities observed in the United States.      The Research Core includes projects that involve (a) utilizing lay health advisors to help patients address the social contextual factors that act as barriers to hypertension management, (b) utilizing interpreters as advocates for Spanish speaking patients with hypertension or kidney disease, and (c) utilizing transplant recipients as navigators to improve access to kidney transplantation. The Research Training/Education Core involves (a) recruiting students, particularly from minority backgrounds, into undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral programs related to health disparities, (b) providing diverse educational opportunities relevant to health disparities research, and (c) supporting postdoctoral students and junior faculty, particularly from underrepresented groups, to ensure successful entry into academic positions. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core involves a community-based video intervention to enhance signing of organ donor cards. The Administrative Core will coordinate and foster interactions across projects/cores, provide shared resources and personnel, assist in other community efforts to address disparities, lead interactions with other NCMHD Research Centers of Excellence, disseminate findings, and develop future initiatives.   Each of the three research projects as well as the Community Engagement/Outreach Core focus on testing interventions to reduce health disparities. Moreover, the design of these interventions is informed by an understanding of the mechanisms that created health disparities in each of the areas studied. Other strengths and innovative features of our application include selection of projects through a community-wide approach, a strong institutional commitment, and the experience and commitment of the study team. In addition, the proposed projects have been designed not only to address an important aspect of health disparities but also to set the stage for future larger scale efforts. The community and institutional infrastructure established as a result of conducting these projects will be used in future efforts that target a broader range of conditions.

"Racial Differences in Phosphorus Metabolism in Health and in Kidney Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Candidate: Orlando Gutierrez received his MD from the University of Toledo, and completed his Internal Medicine Residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is currently a clinical and research fellow in nephrology at MGH, and a candidate for a Master's degree in human physiological investigation from Harvard Medical School. Mentor: Dr. David Nathan is a renowned clinical investigator who has trained numerous investigators in patient-oriented clinical research. Dr. Nathan will ensure the success of Dr. Gutierrez's research training, project, and overall career development. Research: Blacks with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progress to end stage renal disease and develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) more rapidly than Whites. The mechanisms that underlie these disparities remain elusive. Hyperphosphatemia is linked with both accelerated kidney and CVD progression. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) are the primary hormones that regulate serum phosphate (Pi) levels. Preliminary data from our group indicate that Blacks with CKD have a higher prevalence of hyperphosphatemia than Whites at all levels of glomerular filtration rate despite higher PTH levels, suggesting that Blacks have impaired Pi excreting capacity. Impaired Pi excretion may represent a novel risk factor for faster kidney and CV disease progression in Blacks. However, no studies have examined differences in Pi handling by race. For Aim 1, we will examine racial differences in gut and renal Pi handling by measuring (1) gut Pi absorption after a fixed Pi meal and (2) dynamic changes in urinary Pi excretion in response to oral Pi loading in healthy Blacks vs. Whites. For Aim 2, we will examine racial differences in hormonal reguation of Pi metabolism by comparing (1) the phosphaturic effect of synthetic PTH infusion and (2) dynamic changes in FGF-23 levels after oral Pi loading in healthy Blacks vs. Whites. For Aim 3, we will examine racial differences in Pi handling in CKD by measuring urinary Pi excretion in response to dietary Pi loading in Blacks vs. Whites with CKD. We will then compare any differences in CKD to those seen in healthy individuals. We believe the results of these studies will provide critical new insights into racial differences in Pi metabolism that may help elucidate racial disparities in CKD outcomes with important public health implications. A K23 award will allow Dr. Gutierrez to attain new skills in clinical investigation and develop into an independent clinical investigator.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We believe the results of these studies will provide critical new insights into racial differences in serum phosphate metabolism that may help elucidate racial disparities in chronic kidney disease outcomes with important public health implications.                ",Racial Differences in Phosphorus Metabolism in Health and in Kidney Disease,7886768,K23DK081673,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Diet ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Dietary intake ', ' training project ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Epidemic ', ' Cyclic AMP ', ' cAMP ', "" adenosine 3'5' monophosphate "", "" Adenosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogen phosphate) "", ' Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', "" Adenosine Cyclic 3',5'-Monophosphate "", "" 3'5'-cyclic ester of AMP "", ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' urinary ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' General Hospitals ', ' human PTH protein ', ' human parathyroid hormone ', ' hPTH(1-84) ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Excretory function ', ' excretion ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nephrons ', ' Uriniferous Tube ', ' Parathyroid Hormones ', ' parathormone ', ' Parathyroid Hormone (1-84) ', ' PTH (1-84) ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Hormonal ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' phosphorus metabolism ', ' success ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' absorption ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' hormone regulation ', ' hormonal regulation ', ' Accounting ', ' feeding ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' fibroblast growth factor 23 ', ' FGF23 gene product ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2010,67222,0.07164340455961171
"Chronic Kidney Disease in Disadvantaged Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Yoshio Hall, an Assistant Professor in nephrology at the University of Washington. Dr. Hall is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in medically underserved populations. This K23 award will provide Dr. Hall with training and mentored research experience in the following areas: (1) recruiting and maintaining a patient cohort; (2) performing and validating diagnostic tests; (3) developing and maintaining a CKD registry from multiple data sources; (4) training in health information technology, (5) training in advanced statistical and epidemiologic methods; and (6) designing pilot intervention studies. To achieve these goals, Dr. Hall has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Jonathan Himmelfarb, Director of the Kidney Research Institute and Professor of Medicine, who is recognized internationally as a leader in translational and outcomes research in persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and acute kidney injury, and two co-mentors: Dr. Edward Boyko, Acting Head of the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Washington and former Director of the VA-funded Epidemiologic Research and Information Center, who is an internationally known investigator in the epidemiology of diabetes and obesity with extensive experience in disease registry development and management; and Dr. Glenn Chertow, Chief of Nephrology and Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, who is internationally recognized as a leader in improving care for persons with acute and chronic kidney disease . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health problem which affects more than 26 million Americans. In the US, members of racial-ethnic minority groups and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of CKD, particularly ESRD. We hypothesize that the disparate rates of ESRD among these at-risk groups reflect a pattern of underutilization of care. We further hypothesize that public health systems which disproportionately care for diverse populations do not consistently identify or provide recommended care to persons with CKD who are at highest risk for progressive disease. We will test these hypotheses using a series of analyses that leverage data from (1) Harborview Medical Center, the largest public hospital system in the northwestern United States; and (2) The Community Health Network, a large safety net health system in northern California. This research will form the basis for patient-centered interventions to improve the delivery of care to diverse populations. Public health relevance: Improved understanding of local- and system-level barriers to care delivery in historically disadvantaged populations may reduce pervasive racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in care and decrease the growing burden of CKD and ESRD to society.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is defined as the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or loss of kidney function. In the United States, chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 27 million Americans and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and cost. In this country, racial-ethnic minority groups and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of chronic kidney disease, particularly end-stage renal disease. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that modifiable local- and system-level factors can be identified which influence the delivery of care and impact long-term risk for development and progression of chronic kidney disease to ESRD among disadvantaged populations.           Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease is defined as the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or loss of kidney function.

"Understanding Race and Culture in Living Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive kidney transplants, the optimal treatment for ESRD. Race disparities exist in the (a) overall rate of transplantation; (b) type of transplant received [i.e., deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) versus living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT)]; and, (c) early post-transplant health outcomes. One of the best ways to reduce racial disparities in transplantation may be to increase the rate of LDKT among AAs. Although it is known that LDKT is the optimal treatment for ESRD, and that AAs receive LDKTs at much lower rates than whites, the reasons for this disparity among patients already referred for transplant are poorly understood. Further, even among the group of patients who receive LDKT, race disparities in early post- transplant health outcomes persist. Known biological differences associated with race (e.g., presensitization or heightened immune response, donor co-morbid health conditions) do not fully explain the observed racial disparities. Thus, the central goals of this prospective cohort study are to understand (a) the culturally-related and psychosocial factors associated with race disparities in LDKT, and (b) the relationship of those factors with early post-transplant health outcomes in a sample of AA and white transplant candidates. The proposed project will take an interdisciplinary approach in developing a bio-psychosocial model to understand race disparities in LDKT. It will control for demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, SES), and physical health factors (e.g., physical health, co-morbidities, post-transplant adherence) in order to understand the role of culturally-related factors (e.g., medical mistrust, perceived racism and discrimination, religious beliefs, family networks), transplant related beliefs (e.g., knowledge, decision-making factors, transplant attitudes) and psychosocial factors (e.g., depression/anxiety, social support, coping strategies) on race disparities in LDKT. This prospective cohort study will assess patients (n=1775) at two critical time points leading to transplantation (pre-transplant work-up and completion of transplant evaluation), and at 6 months post-transplant. Predictor variables will be assessed via telephone interview at pre-transplant work-up. Whether or not patients completed transplant evaluation will be assessed at the second time-point through medical record abstraction, and patients' perspective of the quantity and quality of interactions with transplant staff will be assessed with a follow-up interview after transplant evaluation is completed. Finally, type of transplant received as well as early post-transplant health outcomes will be assessed using a final follow-up telephone interview, and additional medical record abstraction. Findings from this study are an essential step toward the long-term goal of developing patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post- transplant health outcomes among African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESRD. Because known biological differences do not fully explain the observed racial disparities, this project will examine how culturally-related factors are associated with barriers and facilitators to LDKT and subsequent early post-transplant health outcomes.

"Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is a request for a Mentored Career Award for Faculty at Minority Institutions that will allow the candidate to develop a long-term research program concerned with the relationship between socio- economic distress (SED) associated with disadvantaged minority group membership and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The primary goal of this research project is to develop and elaborate a model specifying how distressing social and economic environments are associated with psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that impact the prevalence of CKD among African Americans. This project proposal outlines a plan of career development and intensive research activities that will leverage already completed doctoral level research and training in the social sciences. Substantive courses in addition to intense topical workshops and seminars will provide a structured means to strengthen five core competencies (i. e., epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, leadership, and scientific presentation) that are necessary to establish a program of research investigating how non-traditional, non-biomedical factors and traditional biomedical risk factors independently and collectively impact CKD among an at-risk population. The research proposed in this application has three specific aims. The proposed project will: 1) examine the extent to which socio-economic distress or SED is associated with CKD among African Americans: 2) assess the degree to which potentially mediating mechanisms are independently and collectively associated with CKD among African Americans; and 3) determine the extent to which the relationship between SED and CKD is mediated by psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical factors. The models associated with each aim will be assessed through an innovative analysis of data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). The JHS is a longitudinal, population-based study of CVD and related risk factors among African Americans in Mississippi - the state with the worst health profile in the nation. The resources at Meharry Medical College, Vanderbilt University, and the JHS provide a unique setting for a five year program of mentored research, education, and training that will build on the candidate's background in the social sciences to produce cutting-edge epidemiological research focusing on health disparities, CKD, and CVD. This research will incorporate information about the context in which African Americans live and work into empirical models specifying how non-traditional (as well as traditional) biomedical risk factors impact health outcomes; thereby informing health policy's effort to address and eliminate CKD and CVD disparities.           ",Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study,7777771,K01HL088735,"['Behavioral ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Heart ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Distress ', ' Leadership ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Research Activity ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mississippi ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Training and Education ', ' Structure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' population based ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Research Training ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Faculty ', ' ']",NHLBI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,K01,2010,125722,0.0862006873106904
"Impact of Vitamin D on Diabetic Kidney Disease in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic kidney disease is increasing in prevalence and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Health disparities exist in the progression of diabetic kidney disease, with minorities being more affected even when adjusting for treatment, glycemic and hypertensive control, and medical coverage. Secondary prevention of the progression of diabetic kidney disease is hindered by a lack of easily modifiable risk factors. Based on animal and observational studies, vitamin D deficiency is potentially a novel, modifiable risk factor that may interrupt or delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease through direct effects as well as by helping to ameliorate kidney disease risk factors, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension and inflammation. In addition, based on minorities having a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, it may also potentially impact the differential progression of diabetic kidney disease in minorities. However, clinical trials evaluating the impact of vitamin D supplementation on diabetic kidney disease are lacking. Thus, this pilot study has the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation (vitamin D3 at 400 IU/d versus supplementation of 4000 IU/d) on the proportion of African Americans with progression of albuminuria over 12 months and 2) to identify whether kidney disease risk factors such as blood pressure and glycemic control mediate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of albuminuria over 12 months.   We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 102 African American adults ?=18 years old) with vitamin D deficiency, previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes and stage 1 or 2 chronic kidney disease receiving usual care for their diabetes. After a 3 month run-in period of vitamin D supplementation, we will follow participants for an additional 12 months. This pilot will provide relevant information to be used to design a larger randomized, controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Based on current health disparities and vitamin D's biologic mechanisms of action, vitamin D deficiency has the possibility of being a novel, modifiable risk factor that could be added to usual care to decrease health disparities by delaying the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Since much information is unknown regarding the role of Vitamin D in diabetic kidney disease due to the lack of human studies, this pilot study is an important first step towards evaluating the potential impact of this intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetic kidney disease is increasing in prevalence and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D deficiency is potentially a novel, modifiable risk factor that could delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Minorities have been shown to have a higher prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency and are more affected by health disparities that exist in the progression of kidney disease. Due to a lack of clinical trials and human studies, the role of vitamin D in the delaying the progression of early stage diabetic kidney disease is unknown.

"Gender Disparity in Liver Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this multi-disciplinary project is to provide this outstanding candidate with mentored training in patient-oriented research focused on complications of cirrhosis and liver transplantation (LT) outcomes and to prepare her for a career as an independent clinician-scientist. The candidate's research and training activities will be closely supervised and guided by a primary mentor, co-mentors, an Advisory Committee and consultants, each with unique expertise germane to different aspects of the proposed project. The candidate's preliminary data showed that women with serum creatinine (Cr) e 1.0 mg/dl had lower survival rates on the LT waiting list compared to men; this was likely caused by underestimating renal dysfunction in women when using Cr rather than glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to calculate Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Moreover, serum Cr is not an accurate biomarker to detect kidney dysfunction in cirrhosis regardless of gender. The PI will test the hypotheses that (1) gender disparity is caused by underestimating severity of kidney disease in women when using serum Cr rather than GFR to calculate MELD scores, (2) that cystatin C and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) are more accurate biomarkers of renal function in cirrhosis than Cr, and (3) that an equation that includes serum cystatin C, SDMA or both and patient characteristics will be more accurate and precise for determining renal dysfunction in subjects with cirrhosis than existing Cr- and cystatin C-based GFR-estimating equations that were derived in populations without cirrhosis. To test these hypotheses, the PI proposes three Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that gender disparity on the LT waiting list is caused by underestimating renal dysfunction in women when using serum Cr rather than GFR to calculate MELD scores. The PI will elucidate factors underlying gender disparity on the LT waiting list by analyzing United Network for Organ Sharing data of subjects with cirrhosis listed between 2002 and 2009. 2) Establish an accurate biomarker of kidney function in cirrhosis. The PI will enroll 100 subjects with cirrhosis, directly measure GFR using the validated method of non-radiolabeled iothalamate plasma clearance and simultaneously measure serum cystatin C, SDMA, Cr and 24-hour urinary Cr clearance and compare the accuracy of each biomarker for estimating true GFR. 3) Develop an accurate and precise equation to estimate GFR in cirrhosis. The PI will derive and assess the performance of a novel GFR-estimating equation in cirrhosis, based on serum cystatin C, SDMA or both and patient characteristics. The results of this study are anticipated to spur modifications of the MELD score that will reduce gender disparity in liver allocation and establish an inexpensive, readily available, accurate, non-invasive measure of kidney function in cirrhosis. The mentored research training and courses supported by this K23 award will provide the PI with excellent grounding for a successful academic career in health services and patient-oriented research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver) is a leading cause of death and the most common indication for liver transplantation. Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk to develop kidney disease. If kidney disease is not timely and accurately detected in patients with cirrhosis, it may progress to kidney failure and lead to higher mortality rates in women on the liver transplant waiting list causing gender disparity. Currently, existing blood and urine tests are not sensitive enough to detect kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis. This proposed project will examine the gender disparity on the liver transplant waiting list, how well the kidneys work (kidney function) and determine which blood tests are the most accurate for detecting kidney disease in cirrhosis.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver) is a leading cause of death and the most common indication for liver transplantation.

"Living Donor Information Network for Caregiving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 19 million Americans experience the devastating and costly effects of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) African Americans (AA) experience an incidence and prevalence rates 4-6 times greater than Caucasian Americans. Compounding this disparity is the low rate of AAs receiving living kidney donation, which provides the best survival and improvement in physical and psychological outcomes. Only 12% of the living kidney donors in 2008 were AAs. Inadequate donor candidate and caregiver information about donation, and a lack of trust in the healthcare team and transplant center are critical barriers which have been reported (Boulware et al. 2002; Sankar et al., 2006). The purpose of the proposed study is to pilot test randomized clinical trial (RCT) procedures to determine the association of a web-based information and support intervention on donor and informal caregiver psychological outcomes and trust in the transplant team and transplant center. The Living Donor Information Network for Caregiving (LINC) has three components: 1) information modules and links, 2) a discussion board with former kidney donors and their caregivers as mentors, and 3) online study instruments. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) To determine the relationship between donor candidate and caregiver characteristics including race (black and white), previous internet use, and postoperative physical status to use of LINC (times and modules accessed and number of posts). 2) To determine associations in donor candidate and caregiver characteristics to psychological outcomes and trust in the healthcare team and transplant center among those with and without LINC. 3) To explore donor candidate and informal caregiver use of the LINC discussion board. This intervention will address the barrier of inadequate information from health professionals and may diminish concerns among AAs that information provided is inadequate due to racial biases. The long-term objective of LINC is to develop a model of online information and support to be implemented at transplant centers nationally to increase the number of AA living kidney donors. A mixed method approach will be used with quantitative analysis and qualitative description serving to enrich and provide context for quantitative findings. The LINC intervention will provide a model for transplant centers nationally in the use of web-based technology to provide information and support to living organ donors and their informal caregivers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an urgent need to address End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in over 19 million Americans and particularly in African Americans who experience incidence and prevalence rates 4-6 times greater than Caucasian Americans but receive only 12% of the living kidney donations. The disparity in living donations among African Americans which is attributed to inadequate education and support of potential donors can be addressed using the internet at this time of rapidly increasing access to internet-based health information among African Americans (Pew, 2007).

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Kidney Function Decline: Genes or Environment?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carmen A. Peralta, who proposes a novel, multi-disciplinary approach to understanding racial/ethnic disparities in kidney function decline. This award will allow Dr. Peralta the resources and protected time to achieve the following career development goals: (1) to become an independent, translational clinical researcher in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease; (2) to become an expert in the application of genetic epidemiology methods to study these differences; and (3) to utilize sociodemographic measurements to improve understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in these disparities. To achieve these goals, Dr. Peralta has assembled a mentoring team comprised of her sponsor and primary mentor, Dr. Michael Shlipak (an expert in the field of cardiovascular complications of early kidney dysfunction), and two co-mentors: Dr. Neil Risch (a genetic epidemiologist) and Dr. Paula Braveman (an expert in social determinants of health). The epidemic of kidney disease currently affects 13% of U.S. adults, and the progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) affects minorities disparately. African-Americans and Hispanics are the fastest growing groups in the ESRD population. Despite well-documented disparities in progression of advanced kidney disease to ESRD, no studies have evaluated the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or early kidney function decline in the US across racial/ethnic groups. It is unknown whether certain racial/ethnic groups have an increased genetic predisposition due to a common genetic ancestry or whether social or environ- mental factors explain observed differences. Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), Dr. Peralta will compare rates of kidney function decline and incident CKD across four major racial groups and test possible genetic and sociodemographic mechanisms to explain these differences. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To compare rates of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease across four major racial/ethnic groups (Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese- Americans) using creatinine and cystatin C based measures; Aim 2: To evaluate whether genetic ancestry is an independent predictor of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease within racial groups and to explore gene-environment interactions in kidney function decline and incident kidney; and Aim 3: To evaluate the association of individual and neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics with kidney function decline and incident kidney disease across racial groups.       Relevance: A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in racial/ethnic disparities in kidney function decline at earlier stages of kidney dysfunction could lead to important interventions and prevention strategies in halting this costly epidemic.

"A Randomized Trial and Reduce to Disparity in Live Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans comprise a higher percentage of the waiting list for kidney transplantation than would be expected based on population parameters, they wait longer for kidney transplantation, and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT among African Americans with ESRD, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in this patient population. The long-term goal of this research program is to improve education provided to African Americans and, thereby, increase rates of LDKT. The objective of this application is to determine the relative effectiveness of three strategies for increasing LDKT rates in African Americans. The central hypothesis is that a home-based intervention that involves the patient and significant others yields higher LDKT rates in an African American population relative to educational interventions delivered in the transplant center. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the clinical effectiveness of three separate LDKT educational approaches with African American patients; and 2) Determine the sociodemographic, medical, and donation-specific variables that are most strongly associated with pursuing LDKT. One hundred eighty African American adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will be urn randomized to receive one of three educational interventions: home-based (HB), group-based (GB), or standard care (SC). The HB (in the home) and GB (in the transplant center) interventions will provide education to patients and their immediate and extended family members, significant others, and friends. The SC intervention (in the transplant center) mirrors what is currently done at this transplant center and will provide education to individual patients only. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who receive LDKT. Secondary outcomes include live donor inquiries, live donor evaluations, number of potential live donors educated, and LDKT knowledge, concerns, and willingness. Recruitment rates, attrition rates, reasons for nonparticipation and attrition, protocol adherence, and participant satisfaction ratings will be gathered. The proposed research is innovative because it evaluates the relative effectiveness of three educational strategies designed to increase LDKT rates in African Americans. Findings from this study have the potential to close this racial disparity gap by identifying evidence-based educational strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT rates in African Americans.

"Clinical characterization of the APOL1-associated phenotype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer from kidney disease at dramatically higher rates than Caucasian Americans. While socioeconomic factors explain some part of this disparity, genetic factors appear to account for much of the increased disease burden. Work by our team has shown that the major genetic risk is conferred by variants in the APOL1 gene. These variants are coding changes that, in the heterozygous state, provided protection against the trypanosomes that cause African Sleeping Sickness, explaining their high frequency in populations with recent African ancestry. However, two copies of the variants promote kidney disease. We are aware of few if any disease-causing variants of similarly high frequency (the combined allele frequency of the two risk alleles is greater than 30% in African Americans) that carry such high risk of severe disease. Little is known about the precise clinical phenotype conferred by AP0L1 variants. Now that we are able to classify patients by AP0L1 genotype, we can perform clinical studies aimed at understanding how AP0L1- associated kidney disease differs from non-APOLI associated disease. We can begin to determine if the large fraction of African Americans with the high risk genotype differ in the rate of kidney disease progression, response to medication, rate of extra-renal complications, and transplant outcomes. Defining this phenotype in detail will have implications both for understanding the mechanism of this form of disease and for developing better methods of kidney disease prevention and treatment. We have assembled a team of five investigators from four Boston institutions with differing areas of expertise in order to develop a new research aimed at defining the detailed AP0L1-associated phenotype.       RELEVANCE:  This work is aimed at precisely defining the clinical phenotype of kidney disease in African-Americans recently shown to be highly associated with variants in the AP0L1 gene. This appears to be the most important genetic factor contributing to the high rate of kidney disease in African Americans. We anticipate that this work will lead us to a much better understanding of how to care for and prevent kidney disease in this population.           ",Clinical characterization of the APOL1-associated phenotype,8152381,R24DK092158,"['clinical phenotype ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' Placenta ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' loss of function ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' podocyte ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' African ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Endothelium ', ' Chloride Channels ', ' Chloride Ion Channels ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' autophagy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' mutant ', ' Biology ', ' Work ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Research ', ' Outcome ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' response ', ' Health ', ' base ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Physiology ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Institution ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Infection ', ' Patients ', ' Accounting ', ' Genotype ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Clinical ', ' Modeling ', ' Prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' particle ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Caring ', ' Reporting ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Population ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Phenotype ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Risk ', ' Boston ', ' Genes ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Injury ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Cells ', ' Area ', ' Methods ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' high risk ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Pattern ', ' skills ', ' Immune ', ' pathogen ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' Trypanosome ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein oxidation ', ' LDL oxidation ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22 ', ' Chromosome 22 ', ' Acute-Phase Proteins ', ' Acute-Phase Reactants ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R24,2011,492908,0.11897293528319473
"Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease and Vitamin D: Are they related?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   My goal for this career development award is to become an excellent independent investigator in patient-oriented research in chronic kidney disease progression. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are world-wide epidemics with an estimated 19 million people living with CKD and over 300,000 treated with dialysis in the United States. African-Americans and other minorities are disproportionately affected by ESRD with an incidence rate that is almost fourfold that of whites. Risk factors of initiation and progression of CKD and the factors underlying the racial disparities in ESRD have not been fully elucidated. Vitamin D has anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory properties and functions as an endocrine regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. As such, low levels of vitamin D are a potential novel risk factor for progression of CKD. In addition, African-Americans and Hispanics in the United States have lower vitamin D levels than whites, making differences in vitamin D a possible contributor to the differential CKD progression between African-Americans, Hispanics and whites. The first part of my research proposal will use data from the Women's Health Initiative to explore the factors underlying the differences in vitamin D levels between AA and whites. I will then use data from the NHANES III mortality and Medicare linkages to assess associations between low vitamin D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality and incident ESRD. If these associations exist, I will then evaluate whether differences in vitamin D levels may explain the racial disparities in ESRD. My third aim will be to conduct a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D repletion in a multi-ethnic population with CKD, vitamin D deficient and albuminuria to evaluate correction of vitamin D levels, and reductions in albuminuria and blood pressure. I have already proven my commitment and ability to become a successful clinical investigator by obtaining a Master's degree in Clinical Epidemiology and obtaining independent funding as a nephrology fellow through an individual NRSA. This K23 grant will allow me to develop my career through advanced formal coursework, intensive mentoring and the design, planning and conduct of a randomized clinical trial.       ",Racial

"Exploring factors influencing gender disparities in access to transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the modern era, kidney transplantation is a safe and effective treatment for many patients with kidney failure. However, choosing the right patients for kidney transplantation is difficult, especially among older patients. Although older patients who receive transplants survive longer than if they had stayed on dialysis, still very few older patients are placed on the transplant waiting list. This is because no tools exist for determining risk in older patients undergoing transplantation, so clinical decision making has to be based on subjective perceptions of a patient's strength and reserve. Misclassification of these factors by the patient or provider likely results in decreased access to transplantation in a population that stands to greatly benefit from this treatment.  Although transplant outcomes and survival benefit are similar in men and women, it has been well established that women have significantly less access to transplantation than men. We recently showed that this disparity is strongest in older patients, with older women having 30-60% less access than their male counterparts. However, it remains unclear whether patient or provider level factors contribute to this disparity. In this study we will explore differences by gender and age in factors influencing a patient's decision and ability to pursue transplantation. We will then use a new technique to explore the potential role of gender and age biases in a provider's choice to refer a patient for transplantation. Understanding the root causes of this gender/age disparity is crucial to developing interventions to improve access to transplantation, and healthcare in general, for women and older adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although kidney transplantation is safe, effective, and life-extending for many patients, women have significantly less access to transplantation than their male counterparts, and we have shown that this disparity is widest among older women compared with older men. It is unknown whether this happens because of patient-level barriers to seeking transplantation or because of provider-level biases against referral of women compared with men. Since over 50% of dialysis patients are over the age of 65, equal access to transplantation for this subgroup is important; the goal of this project is to explore potential sources of the gender disparity in access to transplantation, and access to healthcare in general, so that interventions to minimize this disparity can be designed.           Public Health Relevance Although kidney transplantation is safe, effective, and life-extending for many patients, women have significantly less access to transplantation than their male counterparts, and we have shown that this disparity is widest among older women compared with older men.

"Gender Disparity in Liver Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this multi-disciplinary project is to provide this outstanding candidate with mentored training in patient-oriented research focused on complications of cirrhosis and liver transplantation (LT) outcomes and to prepare her for a career as an independent clinician-scientist. The candidate's research and training activities will be closely supervised and guided by a primary mentor, co-mentors, an Advisory Committee and consultants, each with unique expertise germane to different aspects of the proposed project. The candidate's preliminary data showed that women with serum creatinine (Cr) e 1.0 mg/dl had lower survival rates on the LT waiting list compared to men; this was likely caused by underestimating renal dysfunction in women when using Cr rather than glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to calculate Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Moreover, serum Cr is not an accurate biomarker to detect kidney dysfunction in cirrhosis regardless of gender. The PI will test the hypotheses that (1) gender disparity is caused by underestimating severity of kidney disease in women when using serum Cr rather than GFR to calculate MELD scores, (2) that cystatin C and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) are more accurate biomarkers of renal function in cirrhosis than Cr, and (3) that an equation that includes serum cystatin C, SDMA or both and patient characteristics will be more accurate and precise for determining renal dysfunction in subjects with cirrhosis than existing Cr- and cystatin C-based GFR-estimating equations that were derived in populations without cirrhosis. To test these hypotheses, the PI proposes three Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that gender disparity on the LT waiting list is caused by underestimating renal dysfunction in women when using serum Cr rather than GFR to calculate MELD scores. The PI will elucidate factors underlying gender disparity on the LT waiting list by analyzing United Network for Organ Sharing data of subjects with cirrhosis listed between 2002 and 2009. 2) Establish an accurate biomarker of kidney function in cirrhosis. The PI will enroll 100 subjects with cirrhosis, directly measure GFR using the validated method of non-radiolabeled iothalamate plasma clearance and simultaneously measure serum cystatin C, SDMA, Cr and 24-hour urinary Cr clearance and compare the accuracy of each biomarker for estimating true GFR. 3) Develop an accurate and precise equation to estimate GFR in cirrhosis. The PI will derive and assess the performance of a novel GFR-estimating equation in cirrhosis, based on serum cystatin C, SDMA or both and patient characteristics. The results of this study are anticipated to spur modifications of the MELD score that will reduce gender disparity in liver allocation and establish an inexpensive, readily available, accurate, non-invasive measure of kidney function in cirrhosis. The mentored research training and courses supported by this K23 award will provide the PI with excellent grounding for a successful academic career in health services and patient-oriented research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver) is a leading cause of death and the most common indication for liver transplantation. Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk to develop kidney disease. If kidney disease is not timely and accurately detected in patients with cirrhosis, it may progress to kidney failure and lead to higher mortality rates in women on the liver transplant waiting list causing gender disparity. Currently, existing blood and urine tests are not sensitive enough to detect kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis. This proposed project will examine the gender disparity on the liver transplant waiting list, how well the kidneys work (kidney function) and determine which blood tests are the most accurate for detecting kidney disease in cirrhosis.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver) is a leading cause of death and the most common indication for liver transplantation.

"Understanding Race and Culture in Living Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive kidney transplants, the optimal treatment for ESRD. Race disparities exist in the (a) overall rate of transplantation; (b) type of transplant received [i.e., deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) versus living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT)]; and, (c) early post-transplant health outcomes. One of the best ways to reduce racial disparities in transplantation may be to increase the rate of LDKT among AAs. Although it is known that LDKT is the optimal treatment for ESRD, and that AAs receive LDKTs at much lower rates than whites, the reasons for this disparity among patients already referred for transplant are poorly understood. Further, even among the group of patients who receive LDKT, race disparities in early post- transplant health outcomes persist. Known biological differences associated with race (e.g., presensitization or heightened immune response, donor co-morbid health conditions) do not fully explain the observed racial disparities. Thus, the central goals of this prospective cohort study are to understand (a) the culturally-related and psychosocial factors associated with race disparities in LDKT, and (b) the relationship of those factors with early post-transplant health outcomes in a sample of AA and white transplant candidates. The proposed project will take an interdisciplinary approach in developing a bio-psychosocial model to understand race disparities in LDKT. It will control for demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, SES), and physical health factors (e.g., physical health, co-morbidities, post-transplant adherence) in order to understand the role of culturally-related factors (e.g., medical mistrust, perceived racism and discrimination, religious beliefs, family networks), transplant related beliefs (e.g., knowledge, decision-making factors, transplant attitudes) and psychosocial factors (e.g., depression/anxiety, social support, coping strategies) on race disparities in LDKT. This prospective cohort study will assess patients (n=1775) at two critical time points leading to transplantation (pre-transplant work-up and completion of transplant evaluation), and at 6 months post-transplant. Predictor variables will be assessed via telephone interview at pre-transplant work-up. Whether or not patients completed transplant evaluation will be assessed at the second time-point through medical record abstraction, and patients' perspective of the quantity and quality of interactions with transplant staff will be assessed with a follow-up interview after transplant evaluation is completed. Finally, type of transplant received as well as early post-transplant health outcomes will be assessed using a final follow-up telephone interview, and additional medical record abstraction. Findings from this study are an essential step toward the long-term goal of developing patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post- transplant health outcomes among African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESRD.

"Dialysis Chains and Access to Cadaveric Renal Transplantation Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dialysis Chains and Access to Cadaveric Renal Transplantation Therapy Abstract Background. Previous research findings and public policy have focused extensively on the factors related to allocation of cadaveric donor kidneys in the U.S. among dialysis patients suffering from End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Kidney transplantation rates differ by sociodemographic characteristics, yet the reasons for this variation are not fully understood. Little is known about why such disparities exist and whether the interplay between dialysis facility chain status and patient case-mix, especially race, can further explain the variation in access to renal transplant therapy (RTT). Using Medicare program data and matching to Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Kidney Wait List files, we will apply multilevel regression models to answer the following two research questions: Research Questions. We propose two research questions: Is there an independent (direct) effect of facility chain status on access to RTT? The hypothesis to be tested: Chain status is independently associated with patient access to RTT, after controlling for facility characteristics and patient case-mix. Can the lower RTT rates for Blacks, Hispanics, women and elderly be further explained by differences in a dialysis facility's chain status? The hypothesis to be tested: Chain status is another important explanatory factor accounting for the previously documented disparities in access to RTT by patient age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Study Design. This analysis will use a retrospective cohort design of incident hemodialysis patients and their providers with two main phases: 1) a 3-month baseline period following enrollment in the Medicare ESRD program, during which time all patient baseline characteristics will be obtained; and 2) a 7-year follow-up period that tracks the participants on the RTT wait- list, RTT procedures, death and censoring events. The study has two analyses, each with a different outcome measure. Analysis I: placement on the OPTN cadaveric kidney transplant waiting list during the 7-year follow-up period. Data on date of wait-listing will be obtained from the USRDS UNOS file; and Analysis II: time to 1st cadaveric transplantation since wait-listed, measured as the total number of days that a patient was active on the wait list Significance. Despite repeated attempts to reduce existing disparities in RTT, there have been limited improvements in this area, suggesting that our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited and incomplete. We propose to examine an innovative new factor - the role of chain status - in access to RTT. Furthermore, given the vitriolic and ongoing debate on ways to improve access and equity in this treatment area, particularly in terms of racial differences, the role that the chains might play appears crucial and has to date not been examined. Achieving study objectives will provide important insights on the relationship between type of facility and RTT, aid clinicians and policy makers in achieving a more equitable access to RTT, and eventually improve care and outcomes of ESRD patients in the U.S. Finally, this study is consistent with Healthy People 2010 Objectives: Chronic Kidney Disease goals of decreasing racial and gender disparities in kidney transplantation rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dialysis Chains and Access to Cadaveric Renal Transplantation Therapy Study Narrative Previous research findings and public policy have focused extensively on the factors related to allocation of cadaveric donor kidneys in the U.S. among dialysis patients suffering from End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

"Exploring factors influencing gender disparities in access to transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the modern era, kidney transplantation is a safe and effective treatment for many patients with kidney failure. However, choosing the right patients for kidney transplantation is difficult, especially among older patients. Although older patients who receive transplants survive longer than if they had stayed on dialysis, still very few older patients are placed on the transplant waiting list. This is because no tools exist for determining risk in older patients undergoing transplantation, so clinical decision making has to be based on subjective perceptions of a patient's strength and reserve. Misclassification of these factors by the patient or provider likely results in decreased access to transplantation in a population that stands to greatly benefit from this treatment.  Although transplant outcomes and survival benefit are similar in men and women, it has been well established that women have significantly less access to transplantation than men. We recently showed that this disparity is strongest in older patients, with older women having 30-60% less access than their male counterparts. However, it remains unclear whether patient or provider level factors contribute to this disparity. In this study we will explore differences by gender and age in factors influencing a patient's decision and ability to pursue transplantation. We will then use a new technique to explore the potential role of gender and age biases in a provider's choice to refer a patient for transplantation. Understanding the root causes of this gender/age disparity is crucial to developing interventions to improve access to transplantation, and healthcare in general, for women and older adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although kidney transplantation is safe, effective, and life-extending for many patients, women have significantly less access to transplantation than their male counterparts, and we have shown that this disparity is widest among older women compared with older men. It is unknown whether this happens because of patient-level barriers to seeking transplantation or because of provider-level biases against referral of women compared with men. Since over 50% of dialysis patients are over the age of 65, equal access to transplantation for this subgroup is important; the goal of this project is to explore potential sources of the gender disparity in access to transplantation, and access to healthcare in general, so that interventions to minimize this disparity can be designed.

"Effects of Age and Race on GFR Estimation in a Population-based Cohort This protocol will evaluate the utility of the two GFR markers, creatinine and cystatin C, in comparison with measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by iohexol clearance in 375 Black and White adult participants of the population-based Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort from the Johns Hopkins clinical center. Although GFR estimation by creatinine has improved over the past decade, there has been inadequate inclusion of persons over 65 years of age, and no study of GFR measurement has occurred within a population-based sample of Blacks and Whites in the United States. To advance the detection and definition of CKD across a broad age range of diverse adults,, we must focus on the higher ranges of GFR, and we must identify the optimal strategy for GFR estimation. The first Aim of this cross-sectional study will be to determine the influence of Black race-ethnicity on serum levels of filtration markers (creatinine and cystatin C) in the general population, and to modify current GFR equations to capture optimally the influence of Black race. The second Aim will be: to evaluate age-related decline in GFR; to compare the relative ability of the filtration markers to capture declining GFR with age; and, to modify current GFR equations to incorporate the influence of age. In executing these Aims, we will determine the optimal biomarker(s) for GFR estimation ¿ creatinine, cystatin C, or both. In addition, blood specimens will be stored with the potential for examination of future filtration markers. To accomplish our objectives, we will measure iohexol-GFR in approximately 375 Black and White MESA participants, spanning a target age range of 55-95. This study could be a major contributor to the National Institute of Health¿s efforts to address the persistent racial disparities in the burden of kidney disease in the United States.  Chronic kidney disease is a public health problem that disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the US.

"Financial Risks and Ethnic/Racial Disparities in Live Kidney Donation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tanjala S. Purnell is a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a research trainee at the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research. She seeks this National Research Service Award (NRSA) Training Grant to support her career development with the goal of becoming a successful independent clinical researcher studying ways to address ethnic/racial health disparities for patients with chronic kidney disease. During this award, Ms. Purnell will pursue rigorous research and didactic training in a program designed to provide a strong foundation for her future career. In her research, she will examine ethnic/racial differences in attitudes regarding economic risks of live kidney donation, determine whether ethnic/racial differences in attitudes are associated with ethnic/race differences in willingness to donate, and she will assess the impact of federal and state policy interventions addressing economic barriers to live donation upon ethnic/racial differences in live kidney donation rates. Additionally, she will assess whether access to enabling resources (including income/wealth, health insurance, and occupational prestige) explain the relation of ethnic/race differences in attitudes toward economic risks and ethnic/race differences in willingness to donate. To accomplish these aims, she will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of living kidney donation attitudes and behaviors in the United States, utilizing complex weighted survey data obtained from regional and national studies of persons in the general public and by creating a national dataset of living kidney donors utilizing publicly available data from several sources. She will employ regression analyses, multiple-time series analyses, and other longitudinal analysis techniques in these studies. Ms. Purnell's research objectives are closely aligned with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases end-stage renal disease target focus of improving rates of kidney transplantation and donation, particularly by African Americans and other ethnic/racial minority groups. In her didactic program, Ms. Purnell will take advanced coursework in research methods, including advanced techniques in study design and analysis, grant writing, and research ethics. Through attendance at national meetings as well as several advanced research seminars, held in the supportive training environment at the Welch Center, she will also have the opportunity to observe the work of others and present her own work. She has identified a team of experienced faculty mentors who are committed to supporting her success and who will make sure she has the resources to assure her completion of the proposed aims of this application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My primary career goal is to become a successful independent health services and policy researcher whose work directly contributes to improving health outcomes and reducing disparities in measures of access and quality for patients with chronic kidney disease. I want my future work to contribute to the implementation of federal and state policy legislation that improves health outcomes for chronic kidney disease patients and influences healthcare decision-making that will improve delivery of care for vulnerable populations. I also plan to motivate and train future health services and policy researchers by pursuing a career in academia.

"TAILORED COMPUTER EDUCATION TO INCREASE LIVING DONATION IN AFRICAN-AMERICANS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney transplantation offers patients in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 3 to 17 additional years of life and improved quality-of-life compared to remaining on dialysis. Because of the deceased donor organ shortage, more kidney patients are choosing to receive kidneys from family and friends, a process called living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Although African-Americans are 3.7 times more likely to develop ESRD, they are less likely to receive LDKTs. Therefore, this project will assess whether racial disparities in transplant knowledge, readiness to pursue LDKT, completion of transplant medical evaluation, and receipt of LDKTs can be reduced when ESRD patients receive access to personalized coaching and individually-tailored feedback using an Explore Transplant computerized Expert System. This multilevel study will also examine how other known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT impact the Expert System's effectiveness. ESRD patients presenting for transplant medical evaluation at Barnes-Jewish Transplant Center in St. Louis, Missouri (465 African-Americans, 465 Whites) will be stratified by race and randomized to one of two education conditions (Explore Transplant Expert System vs. Standard Education Control). As they complete transplant medical evaluation, patients in the Expert System condition will receive individually tailored feedback reports and personalized coaching addressing variables important to behavior change and associated with LDKT health disparities. Control patients will only receive standard-of-care education provided by the transplant center. Changes in key outcomes will be assessed at four time points (2-months before in-hospital evaluation day (IHED) (baseline), 2- and 6-months post-IHED, and 18-months post-baseline). The grant has four aims:  Aim 1 (Primary): Compared to the Control Group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System increase in their LDKT readiness and transplant knowledge 6-months post-IHED.  Aim 2: Compared to the Control group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System are more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT 18- months post-baseline.  Aim 3: To examine whether the Expert System's effectiveness in changing LDKT decision-making and behavior is equivalent between African-Americans and Whites.  Aim 4: To examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with the Expert System to affect African-Americans' decision-making and behavior.  At the conclusion of the study, we will have developed an innovative and cost-effective Explore Transplant Expert System that could be utilized by providers in 5,000 dialysis and 250 transplant centers to tailor LDKT discussion and education based on the needs of individual patients of different races.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with kidney failure have better health and quality-of-life when they receive a transplant, especially a transplant from a living donor (LDKT). Although kidney failure disproportionately affects African-Americans, Whites are more likely to receive LDKTs. This randomized controlled trial of 930 African-American and White patients will develop and assess the effectiveness of individually tailored, computer-generated education using an Expert System for overcoming specific barriers affecting African-Americans' pursuit of LDKT.           Patients with kidney failure have better health and quality-of-life when they receive a transplant, especially a transplant from a living donor (LDKT).

"Chronic Kidney Disease in Disadvantaged Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Yoshio Hall, an Assistant Professor in nephrology at the University of Washington. Dr. Hall is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in medically underserved populations. This K23 award will provide Dr. Hall with training and mentored research experience in the following areas: (1) recruiting and maintaining a patient cohort; (2) performing and validating diagnostic tests; (3) developing and maintaining a CKD registry from multiple data sources; (4) training in health information technology, (5) training in advanced statistical and epidemiologic methods; and (6) designing pilot intervention studies. To achieve these goals, Dr. Hall has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Jonathan Himmelfarb, Director of the Kidney Research Institute and Professor of Medicine, who is recognized internationally as a leader in translational and outcomes research in persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and acute kidney injury, and two co-mentors: Dr. Edward Boyko, Acting Head of the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Washington and former Director of the VA-funded Epidemiologic Research and Information Center, who is an internationally known investigator in the epidemiology of diabetes and obesity with extensive experience in disease registry development and management; and Dr. Glenn Chertow, Chief of Nephrology and Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, who is internationally recognized as a leader in improving care for persons with acute and chronic kidney disease . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health problem which affects more than 26 million Americans. In the US, members of racial-ethnic minority groups and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of CKD, particularly ESRD. We hypothesize that the disparate rates of ESRD among these at-risk groups reflect a pattern of underutilization of care. We further hypothesize that public health systems which disproportionately care for diverse populations do not consistently identify or provide recommended care to persons with CKD who are at highest risk for progressive disease. We will test these hypotheses using a series of analyses that leverage data from (1) Harborview Medical Center, the largest public hospital system in the northwestern United States; and (2) The Community Health Network, a large safety net health system in northern California. This research will form the basis for patient-centered interventions to improve the delivery of care to diverse populations. Public health relevance: Improved understanding of local- and system-level barriers to care delivery in historically disadvantaged populations may reduce pervasive racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in care and decrease the growing burden of CKD and ESRD to society.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is defined as the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or loss of kidney function. In the United States, chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 27 million Americans and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and cost. In this country, racial-ethnic minority groups and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of chronic kidney disease, particularly end-stage renal disease. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that modifiable local- and system-level factors can be identified which influence the delivery of care and impact long-term risk for development and progression of chronic kidney disease to ESRD among disadvantaged populations.           Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease is defined as the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or loss of kidney function.

"Engaging Communities and Institutions to Reduce Health Disparities in Cleveland Cleveland is characterized by an extremely high poverty rate, substantial numbers of racial/ethnic minorities, and marked health disparities. We propose to engage Cleveland's health care providers, educational institutions, community organizations, and government agencies to understand and reduce health disparities.  To take advantage of pre-existing community and institutional strengths, we will focus initially on 3 interrelated prototypical conditions: hypertension, kidney disease, and transplantation. These conditions affect many individuals and have some of the most striking health disparities observed in the United States.      The Research Core includes projects that involve (a) utilizing lay health advisors to help patients address the social contextual factors that act as barriers to hypertension management, (b) utilizing interpreters as advocates for Spanish speaking patients with hypertension or kidney disease, and (c) utilizing transplant recipients as navigators to improve access to kidney transplantation. The Research Training/Education Core involves (a) recruiting students, particularly from minority backgrounds, into undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral programs related to health disparities, (b) providing diverse educational opportunities relevant to health disparities research, and (c) supporting postdoctoral students and junior faculty, particularly from underrepresented groups, to ensure successful entry into academic positions. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core involves a community-based video intervention to enhance signing of organ donor cards. The Administrative Core will coordinate and foster interactions across projects/cores, provide shared resources and personnel, assist in other community efforts to address disparities, lead interactions with other NCMHD Research Centers of Excellence, disseminate findings, and develop future initiatives.   Each of the three research projects as well as the Community Engagement/Outreach Core focus on testing interventions to reduce health disparities. Moreover, the design of these interventions is informed by an understanding of the mechanisms that created health disparities in each of the areas studied. Other strengths and innovative features of our application include selection of projects through a community-wide approach, a strong institutional commitment, and the experience and commitment of the study team. In addition, the proposed projects have been designed not only to address an important aspect of health disparities but also to set the stage for future larger scale efforts. The community and institutional infrastructure established as a result of conducting these projects will be used in future efforts that target a broader range of conditions.

"Impact of Vitamin D on Diabetic Kidney Disease in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic kidney disease is increasing in prevalence and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Health disparities exist in the progression of diabetic kidney disease, with minorities being more affected even when adjusting for treatment, glycemic and hypertensive control, and medical coverage. Secondary prevention of the progression of diabetic kidney disease is hindered by a lack of easily modifiable risk factors. Based on animal and observational studies, vitamin D deficiency is potentially a novel, modifiable risk factor that may interrupt or delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease through direct effects as well as by helping to ameliorate kidney disease risk factors, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension and inflammation. In addition, based on minorities having a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, it may also potentially impact the differential progression of diabetic kidney disease in minorities. However, clinical trials evaluating the impact of vitamin D supplementation on diabetic kidney disease are lacking. Thus, this pilot study has the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation (vitamin D3 at 400 IU/d versus supplementation of 4000 IU/d) on the proportion of African Americans with progression of albuminuria over 12 months and 2) to identify whether kidney disease risk factors such as blood pressure and glycemic control mediate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of albuminuria over 12 months.   We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 102 African American adults ?=18 years old) with vitamin D deficiency, previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes and stage 1 or 2 chronic kidney disease receiving usual care for their diabetes. After a 3 month run-in period of vitamin D supplementation, we will follow participants for an additional 12 months. This pilot will provide relevant information to be used to design a larger randomized, controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Based on current health disparities and vitamin D's biologic mechanisms of action, vitamin D deficiency has the possibility of being a novel, modifiable risk factor that could be added to usual care to decrease health disparities by delaying the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Since much information is unknown regarding the role of Vitamin D in diabetic kidney disease due to the lack of human studies, this pilot study is an important first step towards evaluating the potential impact of this intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetic kidney disease is increasing in prevalence and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D deficiency is potentially a novel, modifiable risk factor that could delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Minorities have been shown to have a higher prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency and are more affected by health disparities that exist in the progression of kidney disease. Due to a lack of clinical trials and human studies, the role of vitamin D in the delaying the progression of early stage diabetic kidney disease is unknown. This project is an attempt to determine the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of early stage diabetic kidney disease.           Diabetic kidney disease is increasing in prevalence and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality.

"Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mid-Career Investigator Award in ""Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD"" by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Associate Professor-in-Residence of Medicine, Pediatrics and Epidemiology at UCLA Schools of Medicine & Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several UCLA related campuses including Harbor-UCLA and Charles-Drew University. These centers provide care to underserved and indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis to survive. African Americans and Hispanics are vastly overrepresented by 3.6 and 1.5 times greater than non-Hispanic Whites, respectively, among US dialysis patients. Whereas the 5-year survival of dialysis patients is <35%, with the highest mortality among malnourished patients, minorities exhibit lower dialysis mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival disparities and their link to nutritional status and dietary barriers can have major clinical and public health implications. PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race; whereas 2 alternative hypotheses related to bone-and-mineral disorders and psychosocial and coping status will also be examined. PI proposes a 5-year patient-oriented, prospective study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,050 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African Americans & 1/3 Hispanics), in collaboration with Southern California DaVita dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status & quality of life will be assessed longitudinally. Clinical events and survival will be followed, and specimens for ongoing and future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed at GCRC. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be develop- ed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 100,000 HD patients. This K24 award with proposed cohort study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue and expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator of training of new investigators in the fields of CKD nutrition & disparities by continuing his liaison with faculty across several campuses, schools and departments within UCLA system including Depts. of Medicine and Pediatrics, Charles-Drew Univ., and UCLA Public Health. (2) Continue and expand his credible efforts in increasing the availability of research participation to minority populations with CKD in Southern California; and (3) Continue to develop a relatively new area of CKD disparity and nutrition research specifically through continued support of the DaVita Clinical Research both in Southern California and across the nation by examining the cohort of Southern dialysis patients and national dialysis cohorts. The data collected and hypotheses generated throughout this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to power additional clinical studies by early career investigators and mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve on patient care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their relationship to nutritional status, diet and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to developing more effective strategies to improve outcomes in dialysis population, other 20 million Americans with CKD, and another 30 to 40 million people who suffer from chronic disease states and wasting disorders including chronic heart failure, chronic lung or liver diseases, terminal malignancy, AIDS, advanced age, and other conditions with cachexia.

"Association among serum perfluroalkyl chemicals,chronic kidney disease and cardio    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a population-based study to examine the relation of blood levels of perfluroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) to the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in two separate studies in a population-based sample of Appalachian adults. We are requesting funding for secondary analysis of data. This proposal takes advantage of the data on exposures and outcomes already gathered on a population-based cross-sectional sample of 56,554 Appalachian adults who were aged e18 years and 53% of whom were women, residing in six communities in Ohio and West Virginia, called the C8 Health Study. In the study, we have data available on serum PFC levels, the main exposure of interest, on all members of the cohort, including serum levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS or C8s), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA or C8), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS or C6S), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA or C6), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA or C5), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA or C7), perfluorononaoic acid (PFNA or C9), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA or C10), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA or C11), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA or C12) as part of a previous court-mandated health survey. We also have available pertinent data that will enable us to define CKD and CVD, the main outcomes of interest. This includes serum creatinine measurement that is available on all study subjects, enabling us to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. We will define CKD as an eGFR of <60 mL/min per 1.73 meter2, consistent with current guidelines. We also have data on validated, physician diagnosed CVD, including coronary heart disease and stroke. We will examine the putative association between serum PFCs and the outcomes of interest (CKD or CVD) employing standard epidemiological techniques, including multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, gender, race- ethnicity, education, body mass index, and other confounders. Our study provides a unique and cost-effective opportunity to assess the independent association between serum PFC and the presence of CVD and CKD in a large community-based cohort in Appalachia, which is a designated health disparity population. Data from our study will improve the understanding of the health effects of PFCs on humans. Results from the current study will also guide the planning of future follow-up studies of the same cohort population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Perfluroalkyl chemicals (PFC) are detectable in the blood of >98% of S adults. We will study the association between blood PFCs and kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. If we find an association, it indirectly suggests that reducing PFCs may have a role in preventing these diseases.              Perfluroalkyl chemicals (PFC) are detectable in the blood of >98% of US adults.

"Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is a request for a Mentored Career Award for Faculty at Minority Institutions that will allow the candidate to develop a long-term research program concerned with the relationship between socio- economic distress (SED) associated with disadvantaged minority group membership and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The primary goal of this research project is to develop and elaborate a model specifying how distressing social and economic environments are associated with psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors that impact the prevalence of CKD among African Americans. This project proposal outlines a plan of career development and intensive research activities that will leverage already completed doctoral level research and training in the social sciences. Substantive courses in addition to intense topical workshops and seminars will provide a structured means to strengthen five core competencies (i. e., epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, leadership, and scientific presentation) that are necessary to establish a program of research investigating how non-traditional, non-biomedical factors and traditional biomedical risk factors independently and collectively impact CKD among an at-risk population. The research proposed in this application has three specific aims. The proposed project will: 1) examine the extent to which socio-economic distress or SED is associated with CKD among African Americans: 2) assess the degree to which potentially mediating mechanisms are independently and collectively associated with CKD among African Americans; and 3) determine the extent to which the relationship between SED and CKD is mediated by psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical factors. The models associated with each aim will be assessed through an innovative analysis of data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). The JHS is a longitudinal, population-based study of CVD and related risk factors among African Americans in Mississippi - the state with the worst health profile in the nation. The resources at Meharry Medical College, Vanderbilt University, and the JHS provide a unique setting for a five year program of mentored research, education, and training that will build on the candidate's background in the social sciences to produce cutting-edge epidemiological research focusing on health disparities, CKD, and CVD. This research will incorporate information about the context in which African Americans live and work into empirical models specifying how non-traditional (as well as traditional) biomedical risk factors impact health outcomes; thereby informing health policy's effort to address and eliminate CKD and CVD disparities.           ",Socio-economic Distress and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Jackson Heart Study,8195205,K01HL088735,"['Training and Education ', ' Mississippi ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Heart ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Minority ', ' psychosocial ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Faculty ', ' Research Training ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Prevalence ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Work ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Mediating ', ' Environment ', ' Modeling ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' population based ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Structure ', ' Award ', ' programs ', ' career development ', ' Testing ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Goals ', ' social ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Health ', ' Distress ', ' Life ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Institution ', ' Universities ', ' Research ', ' career ', ' ']",NHLBI,JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2011,125202,0.0862006873106904
"Myeloablative T- Replete Haploidentical PBSCT for Patients Without MRD or MUD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many patients, particularly those from ethnic minorities, are unable to access the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation due to the lack of a suitable donor. For such patients, umbilical cord blood can offer an alternative source of hematopoietic cells. However, adults typically require the concurrent use of two cord blood units (DCBT) at considerable expense. In adults such transplants are also associated with delayed immune reconstitution, increased rate of infections and a higher treatment related mortality than transplants from conventional donors. Recently the use of haploidentical (partially matched related donor) hematopoietic cell transplants (haplo-HCT) using T-cell-replete marrow grafts and post- transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have been shown to produce high rates of engraftment and low treatment related mortality (TRM) when used with a non-myeloablative preparative regimen, in patients who lack conventional donors. However, such transplants have limited efficacy in aggressive/advanced myeloid malignancies because of a high relapse rate. In an institutional pilot trial, we have assessed the use of T- replete mobilized peripheral blood (PBSC) and a myeloablative preparative regimen with haplo-HCT + PTCy. Despite the advanced and high-risk nature of the malignancies treated, estimated 6 month TRM was 14% and disease-free survival was 72%. All patients engrafted and developed full donor chimerism in CD3+ and CD33+ cells by day +30. A multi-institutional phase II trial is therefore proposed within the BMT CTN to confirm these encouraging results. The proposed trial will test the hypothesis that this novel approach to myeloablative haplo-HCT is safe and effective when used in a multi-institutional setting. Upon successful completion of this phase II trial, a randomized phase 111 comparison is proposed between this approach to haplo-HCT and myeloablative DCBT. The objective of this phase 111 study will be to directly compare these two approaches to alternative donor transplantation with respect to safety, toxicity, efficacy, cost and immune reconstitution. This trial would definitively determine the best option for myeloablative transplantation in patients with advanced malionancies who lack a matched-sibling or matched unrelated donor RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed research addresses a significant current deficiency in public health. Specifically, it tests a novel strategy that will enable curative myeloablative blood stem cell transplants in patients (particularly those from underserved minorities) who are currently unable to access them due to lack of a conventional donor. If successful, it will transform the standard-of-care by offering life-saving therapy to patients who would have died from their cancer and close a major disparity in healthcare access for ethnic minorities.            ",Myeloablative T- Replete Haploidentical PBSCT for Patients Without MRD or MUD,8174228,U10HL109526,"['Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation ', ' UCB transplantation ', ' Cord Blood Transplantation ', ' Acute Graft Versus Host Disease ', ' Acute GVHD ', ' Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease ', ' Chronic GVHD ', ' pilot trial ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Allogenic ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' peripheral stem cell support ', ' peripheral blood stem cell support ', ' Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Transplantation ', ' Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' PBSC transplantation ', ' PBPC transplantation ', ' Graft Rejection ', ' Transplantation Rejection ', ' Transplant Rejection ', ' Cyclophosphamide ', ' Zytoxan ', ' Syklofosfamid ', ' Sendoxan ', ' Procytox ', ' Neosar ', ' Mitoxan ', ' Ledoxina ', ' Genuxal ', ' Genoxal ', ' Fosfaseron ', ' Enduxan ', ' Endoxana ', ' Endoxan ', ' Cytoxan ', ' Cytophosphane ', ' Cytophosphan ', ' Cyclostine ', ' Cyclostin ', ' Cyclophosphanum ', ' Cyclophosphane ', ' Cyclophosphan ', ' Cyclophosphamidum ', ' Cyclophospham ', ' Cycloblastine ', ' Cycloblastin ', ' Claphene ', ' Clafen ', ' Cicloxal ', ' Ciclofosfamide ', ' Ciclofosfamida ', ' Carloxan ', ' CYCLO-cell ', ' CTX ', ' 2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorin-2-amine, N,N-is(2-chloroethyl)tetrahydro-,2-oxide ', ' 2H-1,3,2-Oxazaphosphorin-2-amine, N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)tetrahydro-, 2-oxide ', ' Cell Transplantation ', ' Siblings ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase II protocol ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' Engraftment ', ' conditioning ', ' Cell Transplants ', ' T-Cell Depletion ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Infection ', ' Marrow ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Safety ', ' Myeloid Cells ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Immune ', ' CD3 Antigens ', ' T3 molecule ', ' T3 Complex ', ' T3 Antigens ', ' OKT3 antigen ', ' CD3 molecule ', ' CD3 Complex ', ' CD3 ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' reconstitution ', ' reconstitute ', ' Graft-vs-Host Disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' Graft-Versus-Host Disease ', ' GVHD ', ' Instruction ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Relapse ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Phase ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Minority ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Caring ', ' Testing ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' cost ', ' in vivo ', ' high risk ', ' comparative ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Research ', ' Address ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Outcome ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Cells ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' Incidence ', ' Life ', ' Regimen ', ' Nature ', ' Peripheral Blood Stem Cell ', ' Peripheral Stem Cells ', ' PBSC ', ' Myeloproliferative disease ', ' myeloproliferative neoplasm ', ' Myeloproliferative Tumors ', ' Myeloproliferative Disorders ', ' Myeloid Tumor ', ' Myeloid Neoplasm ', ' Myeloid Malignancy ', ' Myeloid Disease ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Chimerism ', ' Disease-Free Survival ', ' Event-Free Survival ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHSIDE HOSPITAL ATLANTA,U10,2011,97532,0.060600867481371855
"Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   African Americans are less likely than Whites to receive kidney transplants, despite their being more than two-fold as likely as Whites to develop end stage renal disease (ESRD). Living related kidney donation (LD) offers patients an opportunity to bypass many barriers to receipt of deceased kidney transplants (e.g. waiting lists and immunological incompatibility), but minorities are less likely to receive living related kidney transplants (LRT). Evidence suggests African Americans may not discuss LD/LRT with their families or physicians at optimal rates, and thus may not have adequate information to initiate or participate in shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT. African Americans may also have financial concerns regarding convalescence and out of pocket expenses related to LD/LRT, another barrier impeding LD/LRT.   The primary goals of this study are to overcome these important barriers by enhancing ethnic minorities' consideration of LD/LRT through the promotion of shared decision-making regarding LD/LRT and provision of financial assistance for out of pocket expenses. Our specific aims are: a) to develop culturally sensitive informational (audiovisual) and financial interventions and b) to perform a randomized controlled trial to assess their effectiveness in increasing pursuit of LD/LRT among African American patients with ESRD and their families. We will conduct focus groups to refine the content/delivery of the informational (audiovisual) intervention to promote patient and family shared-decision making and design a written brochure describing the financial assistance (for work loss, childcare and travel costs) intervention. We will enroll 210 adult African American patients with new-onset ESRD from 4 sites (9 dialysis facilities) in the Baltimore metropolitan area and measure their initial commitment to pursue LD/LRT (using the Transtheoretical Model for stages of behavior change). Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: 1) informational incentive alone, 2) informational intervention plus financial assistance, and 3) no intervention (usual care). We will follow participants for up to 12 months for progression in their commitment to LD/LRT (precontemplation stage to contemplation stage to preparation stage to action stage to completion stage (receipt of LD/LRT)). If the interventions are successful in activating patients and their families to consider and undergo LD/LRT, we will disseminate them widely. Effective interventions to improve rates of LD/LRT in African Americans could help eliminate large disparities in receipt of organs for ESRD. The substantial experience of our team in the design and conduct of behavioral, epidemiologic and interventional studies related to donor/recipient health, minority health and kidney disease provides a strong foundation for this research.       ",Information and Financial Interventions for Kidney Donation in African Americans,8132858,R01DK079682,"['ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Audiovisual Material ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Baltimore ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Participant ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Knowledge ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Foundations ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Preparation ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Travel ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Physicians ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' programs ', ' Health ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Process ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Organ ', ' Research ', ' Measures ', ' Site ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Life ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Staging ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Writing ', ' Family ', ' Behavioral ', ' Individual ', ' experience ', ' Patients ', ' Decision Making ', ' Goals ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Work ', ' Modeling ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' cost ', ' metropolitan ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' effective intervention ', ' behavior change ', ' willingness ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Bypass ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' intervention effect ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Persons ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Minority ', ' Convalescence ', ' successful intervention ', ' shared decision making ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' minority health ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,224468,0.05657686918273709

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Kidney Function Decline: Genes or Environment?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carmen A. Peralta, who proposes a novel, multi-disciplinary approach to understanding racial/ethnic disparities in kidney function decline. This award will allow Dr. Peralta the resources and protected time to achieve the following career development goals: (1) to become an independent, translational clinical researcher in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease; (2) to become an expert in the application of genetic epidemiology methods to study these differences; and (3) to utilize sociodemographic measurements to improve understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in these disparities. To achieve these goals, Dr. Peralta has assembled a mentoring team comprised of her sponsor and primary mentor, Dr. Michael Shlipak (an expert in the field of cardiovascular complications of early kidney dysfunction), and two co-mentors: Dr. Neil Risch (a genetic epidemiologist) and Dr. Paula Braveman (an expert in social determinants of health). The epidemic of kidney disease currently affects 13% of U.S. adults, and the progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) affects minorities disparately. African-Americans and Hispanics are the fastest growing groups in the ESRD population. Despite well-documented disparities in progression of advanced kidney disease to ESRD, no studies have evaluated the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or early kidney function decline in the US across racial/ethnic groups. It is unknown whether certain racial/ethnic groups have an increased genetic predisposition due to a common genetic ancestry or whether social or environ- mental factors explain observed differences. Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), Dr. Peralta will compare rates of kidney function decline and incident CKD across four major racial groups and test possible genetic and sociodemographic mechanisms to explain these differences. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To compare rates of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease across four major racial/ethnic groups (Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese- Americans) using creatinine and cystatin C based measures; Aim 2: To evaluate whether genetic ancestry is an independent predictor of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease within racial groups and to explore gene-environment interactions in kidney function decline and incident kidney; and Aim 3: To evaluate the association of individual and neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics with kidney function decline and incident kidney disease across racial groups.       Relevance: A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in racial/ethnic disparities in kidney function decline at earlier stages of kidney dysfunction could lead to important interventions and prevention strategies in halting this costly epidemic.

"Effects of Age and Race on GFR Estimation in a Population-based Cohort This protocol will evaluate the utility of the two GFR markers, creatinine and cystatin C, in comparison with measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by iohexol clearance in 375 Black and White adult participants of the population-based Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort from the Johns Hopkins clinical center. Although GFR estimation by creatinine has improved over the past decade, there has been inadequate inclusion of persons over 65 years of age, and no study of GFR measurement has occurred within a population-based sample of Blacks and Whites in the United States. To advance the detection and definition of CKD across a broad age range of diverse adults,, we must focus on the higher ranges of GFR, and we must identify the optimal strategy for GFR estimation. The first Aim of this cross-sectional study will be to determine the influence of Black race-ethnicity on serum levels of filtration markers (creatinine and cystatin C) in the general population, and to modify current GFR equations to capture optimally the influence of Black race. The second Aim will be: to evaluate age-related decline in GFR; to compare the relative ability of the filtration markers to capture declining GFR with age; and, to modify current GFR equations to incorporate the influence of age. In executing these Aims, we will determine the optimal biomarker(s) for GFR estimation ¿ creatinine, cystatin C, or both. In addition, blood specimens will be stored with the potential for examination of future filtration markers. To accomplish our objectives, we will measure iohexol-GFR in approximately 375 Black and White MESA participants, spanning a target age range of 55-95. This study could be a major contributor to the National Institute of Health¿s efforts to address the persistent racial disparities in the burden of kidney disease in the United States. Chronic kidney disease is a public health problem that disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the US. The normal levels of kidney function and the accuracy of equations to estimate kidney function are not known in racial and ethnic minorities, which represent barriers to effective clinical practice, research and public health efforts for CKD in these groups. The goals of the proposed project are to characterize the usual levels of kidney function in racial and ethnic minorities; to develop more accurate ways to estimate kidney function in racial and ethnic groups.",Effects of Age and Race on GFR Estimation in a Population-based Cohort,8334051,R01DK087961,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Black race ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Creatinine ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Filtration Fractionation ', ' Filtration ', ' Future ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Iohexol 350 ', "" 1,3-Benzenedicarboxamide, 5-(acetyl(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)amino)-N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo- "", ' Iohexol ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' post-gamma-protein ', ' cystatin C ', ' post gamma-globulins ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Sampling ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy aging ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' public health research ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NIDDK,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2012,251028,0.10704027687234287
"Health Literacy in Hispanics with Chronic Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 for Dr. Claudia Lora, who proposes the first systematic examination of health literacy in Hispanics with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This award will allow Dr. Lora the resources and protected time to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming a successful, independent patient-oriented researcher focusing on health care disparities in Hispanics with CKD. While Hispanics currently comprise 15% of the population, they are projected to comprise a quarter of the US population by 2050, Hispanics with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, a better understanding of the factors contributing to the progression of CKD in Hispanics is critical for reducing health disparities and developing therapeutic interventions. Health literacy is known to be associated with health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been well studied in the context of CKD. The potential for health literacy to affect patients' chronic disease management has been recognized by the Institute of Medicine, which in 2004, issued a call to action for research in health literac. Examining health literacy in Hispanics is of utmost importance because minorities and non-English speakers are more likely to have low functional health literacy than non-Hispanic whites. Low health literacy likely contributes to poor health outcomes in Hispanics with CKD through various mechanisms including disease knowledge, access to health care, and health behaviors. By understanding the relationship between health literacy and CKD, we may identify a therapeutic target in CKD progression. In view of the disproportionate burden of kidney disease in Hispanics, the proposed study will examine health literacy in a cohort of Hispanics with CKD. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) To examine health literacy as a predictor for progression of kidney disease in Hispanics with CKD; 2) To examine health literacy as a predictor for cardiovascular events and progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in Hispanics with CKD; and 3) To develop and field test a culturally sensitive, low-literacy, touch tablet application to improve knowledge of hypertension in Hispanics with CKD. The project contains novel concepts and strategies, and will result in the development of a new therapeutic intervention that could improve the health of Hispanics with CKD. The strengths of the proposal are the comprehensive career development plan, the experience and commitment of the mentoring team, and the strong institutional resources and support. In addition, the proposed research is innovative, addresses a growing public health problem, leverages the infrastructure of an ongoing NIH-funded cohort study, and will allow the applicant to gain the skills and experience needed to develop into an independent patient-oriented researcher.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health literacy is known to influence health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been studied in Hispanics with predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). In view of the disproportionate burden of CKD in U.S. Hispanics, the mentored research has two overarching goals: 1) To examine health literacy as a predictor of CKD progression and cardiovascular outcomes in Hispanics with CKD and 2) To develop and pilot a low- literacy, touch tablet application to improve knowledge of hypertension in Hispanics with CKD, which will serve as the basis for a future R01 proposal. The proposed study will advance my research skills towards developing into an independent investigator and the knowledge gained has the potential to advance concepts that drive the field and thereby minimize health disparities in Hispanics with CKD.          Health literacy is known to influence health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been studied in Hispanics with predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD).

"Gender Disparity in Liver Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this multi-disciplinary project is to provide this outstanding candidate with mentored training in patient-oriented research focused on complications of cirrhosis and liver transplantation (LT) outcomes and to prepare her for a career as an independent clinician-scientist. The candidate's research and training activities will be closely supervised and guided by a primary mentor, co-mentors, an Advisory Committee and consultants, each with unique expertise germane to different aspects of the proposed project. The candidate's preliminary data showed that women with serum creatinine (Cr) e 1.0 mg/dl had lower survival rates on the LT waiting list compared to men; this was likely caused by underestimating renal dysfunction in women when using Cr rather than glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to calculate Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Moreover, serum Cr is not an accurate biomarker to detect kidney dysfunction in cirrhosis regardless of gender. The PI will test the hypotheses that (1) gender disparity is caused by underestimating severity of kidney disease in women when using serum Cr rather than GFR to calculate MELD scores, (2) that cystatin C and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) are more accurate biomarkers of renal function in cirrhosis than Cr, and (3) that an equation that includes serum cystatin C, SDMA or both and patient characteristics will be more accurate and precise for determining renal dysfunction in subjects with cirrhosis than existing Cr- and cystatin C-based GFR-estimating equations that were derived in populations without cirrhosis. To test these hypotheses, the PI proposes three Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that gender disparity on the LT waiting list is caused by underestimating renal dysfunction in women when using serum Cr rather than GFR to calculate MELD scores. The PI will elucidate factors underlying gender disparity on the LT waiting list by analyzing United Network for Organ Sharing data of subjects with cirrhosis listed between 2002 and 2009. 2) Establish an accurate biomarker of kidney function in cirrhosis. The PI will enroll 100 subjects with cirrhosis, directly measure GFR using the validated method of non-radiolabeled iothalamate plasma clearance and simultaneously measure serum cystatin C, SDMA, Cr and 24-hour urinary Cr clearance and compare the accuracy of each biomarker for estimating true GFR. 3) Develop an accurate and precise equation to estimate GFR in cirrhosis. The PI will derive and assess the performance of a novel GFR-estimating equation in cirrhosis, based on serum cystatin C, SDMA or both and patient characteristics. The results of this study are anticipated to spur modifications of the MELD score that will reduce gender disparity in liver allocation and establish an inexpensive, readily available, accurate, non-invasive measure of kidney function in cirrhosis. The mentored research training and courses supported by this K23 award will provide the PI with excellent grounding for a successful academic career in health services and patient-oriented research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver) is a leading cause of death and the most common indication for liver transplantation. Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk to develop kidney disease. If kidney disease is not timely and accurately detected in patients with cirrhosis, it may progress to kidney failure and lead to higher mortality rates in women on the liver transplant waiting list causing gender disparity. Currently, existing blood and urine tests are not sensitive enough to detect kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis. This proposed project will examine the gender disparity on the liver transplant waiting list, how well the kidneys work (kidney function) and determine which blood tests are the most accurate for detecting kidney disease in cirrhosis.

"Dialysis Chains and Access to Cadaveric Renal Transplantation Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dialysis Chains and Access to Cadaveric Renal Transplantation Therapy Abstract Background. Previous research findings and public policy have focused extensively on the factors related to allocation of cadaveric donor kidneys in the U.S. among dialysis patients suffering from End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Kidney transplantation rates differ by sociodemographic characteristics, yet the reasons for this variation are not fully understood. Little is known about why such disparities exist and whether the interplay between dialysis facility chain status and patient case-mix, especially race, can further explain the variation in access to renal transplant therapy (RTT). Using Medicare program data and matching to Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Kidney Wait List files, we will apply multilevel regression models to answer the following two research questions: Research Questions. We propose two research questions: Is there an independent (direct) effect of facility chain status on access to RTT? The hypothesis to be tested: Chain status is independently associated with patient access to RTT, after controlling for facility characteristics and patient case-mix. Can the lower RTT rates for Blacks, Hispanics, women and elderly be further explained by differences in a dialysis facility's chain status? The hypothesis to be tested: Chain status is another important explanatory factor accounting for the previously documented disparities in access to RTT by patient age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Study Design. This analysis will use a retrospective cohort design of incident hemodialysis patients and their providers with two main phases: 1) a 3-month baseline period following enrollment in the Medicare ESRD program, during which time all patient baseline characteristics will be obtained; and 2) a 7-year follow-up period that tracks the participants on the RTT wait- list, RTT procedures, death and censoring events. The study has two analyses, each with a different outcome measure. Analysis I: placement on the OPTN cadaveric kidney transplant waiting list during the 7-year follow-up period. Data on date of wait-listing will be obtained from the USRDS UNOS file; and Analysis II: time to 1st cadaveric transplantation since wait-listed, measured as the total number of days that a patient was active on the wait list Significance. Despite repeated attempts to reduce existing disparities in RTT, there have been limited improvements in this area, suggesting that our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited and incomplete. We propose to examine an innovative new factor - the role of chain status - in access to RTT. Furthermore, given the vitriolic and ongoing debate on ways to improve access and equity in this treatment area, particularly in terms of racial differences, the role that the chains might play appears crucial and has to date not been examined. Achieving study objectives will provide important insights on the relationship between type of facility and RTT, aid clinicians and policy makers in achieving a more equitable access to RTT, and eventually improve care and outcomes of ESRD patients in the U.S. Finally, this study is consistent with Healthy People 2010 Objectives: Chronic Kidney Disease goals of decreasing racial and gender disparities in kidney transplantation rates.        Dialysis Chains and Access to Cadaveric Renal Transplantation Therapy Study Narrative Previous research findings and public policy have focused extensively on the factors related to allocation of cadaveric donor kidneys in the U.S. among dialysis patients suffering from End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Kidney transplantation rates differ by sociodemographic characteristics, yet the reasons for this variation are not fully understood. Little is known about why such disparities exist and whether the interplay between dialysis facility chain status and patient case-mix, especially race, can further explain the variation in access to renal transplant therapy (RTT). This study will determine the proportion of dialysis patients placed on the Wait List and the median time for a first cadaveric kidney transplant based on chain status of the patient's dialysis facility. This study will extend research on variation of access to RTT by examining the role of chain status thereby identifying a potentially new and modifiable factor. Achieving study objectives will provide important insights on the relationship between type of facility and RTT, aid clinicians and policy makers in achieving a more equitable access to RTT, and eventually improve care and outcomes of ESRD patients in the U.S. This study is consistent with Healthy People 2010 Objectives: Chronic Kidney Disease goals of decreasing racial and gender disparities in kidney transplantation rates.

"Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mid-Career Investigator Award in ""Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD"" by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Associate Professor-in-Residence of Medicine, Pediatrics and Epidemiology at UCLA Schools of Medicine & Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several UCLA related campuses including Harbor-UCLA and Charles-Drew University. These centers provide care to underserved and indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis to survive. African Americans and Hispanics are vastly overrepresented by 3.6 and 1.5 times greater than non-Hispanic Whites, respectively, among US dialysis patients. Whereas the 5-year survival of dialysis patients is <35%, with the highest mortality among malnourished patients, minorities exhibit lower dialysis mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival disparities and their link to nutritional status and dietary barriers can have major clinical and public health implications. PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race; whereas 2 alternative hypotheses related to bone-and-mineral disorders and psychosocial and coping status will also be examined. PI proposes a 5-year patient-oriented, prospective study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,050 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African Americans & 1/3 Hispanics), in collaboration with Southern California DaVita dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status & quality of life will be assessed longitudinally. Clinical events and survival will be followed, and specimens for ongoing and future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed at GCRC. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be develop- ed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 100,000 HD patients. This K24 award with proposed cohort study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue and expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator of training of new investigators in the fields of CKD nutrition & disparities by continuing his liaison with faculty across several campuses, schools and departments within UCLA system including Depts. of Medicine and Pediatrics, Charles-Drew Univ., and UCLA Public Health. (2) Continue and expand his credible efforts in increasing the availability of research participation to minority populations with CKD in Southern California; and (3) Continue to develop a relatively new area of CKD disparity and nutrition research specifically through continued support of the DaVita Clinical Research both in Southern California and across the nation by examining the cohort of Southern dialysis patients and national dialysis cohorts. The data collected and hypotheses generated throughout this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to power additional clinical studies by early career investigators and mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve on patient care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their relationship to nutritional status, diet and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to developing more effective strategies to improve outcomes in dialysis population, other 20 million Americans with CKD, and another 30 to 40 million people who suffer from chronic disease states and wasting disorders including chronic heart failure, chronic lung or liver diseases, terminal malignancy, AIDS, advanced age, and other conditions with cachexia. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important plans.           Project Narrative: Relevance of Research to Public Health  Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their relationship to nutritional status, diet and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to developing more effective strategies to improve outcomes in dialysis population, other 20 million Americans with CKD, and another 30 to 40 million people who suffer from chonic disease states and wasting disorders including chronic heart failure, chronic lung or liver diseases, terminal malignacy, AIDS, advanced age, and other conditions with cachexia.

"House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While kidney transplantation is the best treatment option for adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), profound racial and socioeconomic disparities persist. Minorities and low-income patients, for instance, are less likely to receive lve donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), which yields better survival, quality of life, and health care cost outcomes than chronic dialysis or deceased donor transplantation. Guided by a socio- ecological model of LDKT, the PI developed an innovative House Calls intervention that has shown to be effective at overcoming barriers and increasing LDKT rates in Black patients. We now seek to expand the reach and intensity of the House Calls intervention by including other minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and by adding a novel Patient-Centered Decision Support component. Also, little is known about those variables that mediate the intervention's impact on the occurrence of LDKT or whether the intervention can attenuate the growing gender disparity in living donation. In this study, we will pursue three specific aims: (1) evaluate the differential benefit of adding a patient-centered decision support component to the House Calls intervention; (2) identify mediators of the relationship between the interventions and the occurrence of LDKT; and (3) examine whether the House Calls intervention reduces the gender disparity in rates of living kidney donation. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a single-site, randomized controlled trial with a planned enrollment of 100 minority and low income patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Patients will be randomized to receive the House Calls intervention alone (HC) or the House Calls intervention + a web-based Patient-Centered Decision Support intervention (HC+DS). The central hypothesis is that, compared to HC alone, the HC+DS group will have a higher proportion of enrolled patients with LDKT by the 2-yr study endpoint (primary outcome) and higher proportions of enrolled patients with at least one live donor inquiry, at least one live donor evaluation, and in LDKT action (vs. contemplation) stages (secondary outcomes). Also, we will evaluate whether the House Calls intervention (either HC alone or HC+DS) leads to more donor inquiries, evaluations, and actual donations from men, relative to a non-intervention control group, controlling for patient race/ethnicity, gender, age, and household income. By identifying effective interventions for patient populations with historically lower rates of LDKT, we can eliminate many barriers to access, reduce disease burden, and lower mortality rates by producing more donor organs for transplantation. We are especially well-prepared to conduct the proposed research due to the multidisciplinary nature of the research team, as well as the expertise and experience of the team in developing LDKT and living donation educational materials, implementing and evaluating the House Calls intervention, conducting LDKT research with minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, and producing meaningful scientific and clinical outcomes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Certain minorities and low-income patients are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease. While kidney transplantation offers the best option for long-term survival and reduced morbidity, minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged wait longer for kidney transplantation and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in minority and low-income patients. The proposed research is innovative because it further evaluates the relative effectiveness of one of the only empirically-supported interventions to reduce racial disparities in LDKT. Specifically, it will expand the reach of the intervention to include more minority groups, low-income patients, and a novel patient-centered decision support component. Findings from this study have the potential to close the health disparity gap by identifying effective educational and interventional strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT in minority and low-income patients.              Certain minorities and low-income patients are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease.

"Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but large racial disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. In 2009, Blacks, who comprised 36.9% of the dialysis population, received 32.4% of deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKTs) but just 13.7% of LDKTs. A multi- component intervention that addresses the many barriers that impede LDKT (e.g. transplant candidates' lack of knowledge about LDKT; fears regarding donor's future health; guilt; and discomfort with discussing LDKT) could plausibly increase LDKT among Blacks. Our main objective is to test an educational and behavioral intervention that is designed to increase receipt of LDKT among newly-listed transplant candidates who are Black. We hypothesize that a multi-component intervention will increase both readiness to pursue LDKT and actual receipt of LDKTs among Blacks. We propose a parallel group, two-arm randomized trial among 500 Black kidney transplant candidates. After Blacks are placed on the waiting list for a DDKT, we will randomly assign them to either: (1) a control group that will receive Usual Care, or (2) an Intervention group that will receive a culturally sensitive, group-based intervention. Participants randomized to the Intervention will be asked to attend a 60-90 minute small group seminar (family and friends strongly encouraged to attend) that will feature brief talks regarding: basic facts about CKD, transplant, and the waiting list; basic facts about live kidney donation; the experience of receiving a transplant and LDKT; the experience of serving as a live kidney donor; and skill-building regarding how to ask for a live donor. These talks will directly address the barriers that impede LDKT. Physicians and Black LDKT recipients and live donors will lead these talks, supplemented by educational videos. In our preparatory aim, we will develop the Intervention and train the speakers. Our primary aim will compare LDKT readiness and LDKT receipt in the Intervention vs. Usual Care groups of our randomized clinical trial; our primary outcome is change in readiness to pursue LDKT, and our main secondary outcome is actual receipt of LDKT, after 18 months of follow-up. Our secondary aims will determine (a) the social and behavioral variables that modify the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt; and (b) whether changes in social and behavioral factors mediate the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. This clinical trial will occur at two neighboring transplant centers that share the same policies, procedures, and personnel. In an average year, these two centers combine to place over 200 Blacks on the DDKT waiting list and perform over 135 LDKTs (including ~29 among Blacks). By intervening upon patients ""distal"" in the transplant process, at two centers that perform many LDKTs, we have excellent power to detect a beneficial effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. At the end of this study, we will have developed and tested a culturally sensitive educational and behavioral Intervention that has the potential to increase receipt of LDKT among Blacks and decrease the striking racial disparities in receipt of LDKT.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blacks with kidney failure are much less likely to receive a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which is usually the best treatment for kidney failure. We propose a randomized clinical trial to test an intervention consisting of practical but potent educational seminars that will feature video-based modules and ""live"" talks by physicians, LDKT recipients, and live donors. Among 500 kidney transplant candidates who are Black and newly activated on the transplant waiting list, our trial will determine whether this Intervention (compared to Usual Care) increases readiness for and receipt of LDKT.              Blacks with kidney failure are much less likely to receive a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which is usually the best treatment for kidney failure.

"Improving Primary Care to Narrow Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem affecting over 30 million US adults, who are at increased risk for hospitalization, cardiovascular disease, progression to end-stage renal disease, and death. African Americans are disproportionately affected by CKD, experiencing a four-fold greater incidence of end-stage renal disease than Whites. Receipt of high-quality primary care for patients with CKD creates opportunities for patients to identify and treat their risks for CKD progression and represents a key strategy for both improving patients' clinical outcomes overall and for addressing racial disparities in CKD progression. Evidence suggests that, overall, the primary care of patients with CKD (including patients' appropriate utilization of primary care services, primary care providers' appropriate management of CKD, and high-quality patient-physician discussions about CKD) is lacking. Studies identifying the contribution of suboptimal primary care to racial disparities in CKD outcomes have not previously been performed. Further, mechanisms through which interventions to improve primary care might narrow disparities are unknown. The overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) conduct a retrospective cohort study to quantify differences in the utilization of primary care services and the quality of CKD care among African American and Whites with CKD and explore the contribution of these differences to racial disparities in CKD outcomes, 2) conduct a cross- sectional study to identify key system-, provider-, and patient-level factors contributing to racial disparities in utilization and quality of CKD care in primary care settings, and 3) conduct a prospective cohort study of African Americans with CKD, to assess the quality of patients' interactions with their primary care providers about CKD, and to explore the association of high-quality interactions with patients' improved understanding and self-management of their risks for CKD progression.  The candidate for this mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Raquel Greer, is a General Internist and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and her long-term career goal is to establish her independence as a patient-oriented researcher addressing mechanisms leading to ethnic/racial disparities in CKD. During the award, Dr. Greer will undergo a rigorous didactic and research program, including an advanced, intensive set of didactic courses, seminars, and practical research experience that will substantially build her skills in developing and studying interventions to address ethnic/racial disparities in the care of patients with CKD. These career development activities will be conducted within the rich training environment of Johns Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research with direct guidance from outstanding mentors and advisors with expertise in studying the health care and clinical outcomes of patients with CKD, health disparities research, and other related research methods.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Kidney Function Decline: Genes or Environment? Project Summary: This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carmen A. Peralta, who proposes a novel, multi-disciplinary approach to understanding racial/ethcnic disparities in kidney function decline. This award will allow Dr. Peralta the resources and protected time to achieve the following career development goals: (1) to become an independent, translational clinical researcher in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease; (2) to become an expert in the application of genetic epidemiology methods to study these differences; and (3) to utilize sociodemographic measurements to improve understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in these disparities. To achieve these goals, Dr. Peralta has assembled a mentoring team comprised of her sponsor and primary mentor, Dr. Michael Shlipak (an expert in the field of cardiovascular complications of early kidney dysfunction), and two co-mentors: Dr. Neil Risch (a genetic epidemiologist) and Dr. Paula Braveman (an expert in social determinants of health).  The epidemic of kidney disease currently affects 13% of U.S. adults, and the progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) affects minorities disparately. African-Americans and Hispanics are the fastest grow- ing groups in the ESRD population. Despite well-documented disparities in progression of advanced kidney disease to ESRD, no studies have evaluated the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or early kidney function decline in the US across racial/ethnic groups. It is unknown whether certain racial/ethnic groups have an increased genetic predisposition due to a common genetic ancestry or whether social or environ- mental factors explain observed differences. Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), Dr. Peralta will compare rates of kidney function decline and incident CKD across four major racial groups and test possible genetic and sociodemographic mechanisms to explain these differences. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To compare rates of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease across four major racial/ethnic groups (Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese- Americans) using creatinine and cystatin C based measures; Aim 2: To evaluate whether genetic ancestry is an independent predictor of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease within racial groups and to explore gene-environment interactions in kidney function decline and incident kidney; and Aim 3: To evaluate the association of individual and neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics with kidney function decline and incident kidney disease across racial groups. Relevance: A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in racial/ethnic disparities in kidney function decline at earlier stages of kidney dysfunction could lead to important interventions and prevention strategies in halting this costly epidemic. .

"Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mid-Career Investigator Award in ""Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD"" by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Associate Professor-in-Residence of Medicine, Pediatrics and Epidemiology at UCLA Schools of Medicine & Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several UCLA related campuses including Harbor-UCLA and Charles-Drew University. These centers provide care to underserved and indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis to survive. African Americans and Hispanics are vastly overrepresented by 3.6 and 1.5 times greater than non-Hispanic Whites, respectively, among US dialysis patients. Whereas the 5-year survival of dialysis patients is <35%, with the highest mortality among malnourished patients, minorities exhibit lower dialysis mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival disparities and their link to nutritional status and dietary barriers can have major clinical and public health implications. PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race; whereas 2 alternative hypotheses related to bone-and-mineral disorders and psychosocial and coping status will also be examined. PI proposes a 5-year patient-oriented, prospective study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,050 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African Americans & 1/3 Hispanics), in collaboration with Southern California DaVita dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status & quality of life will be assessed longitudinally. Clinical events and survival will be followed, and specimens for ongoing and future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed at GCRC. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be develop- ed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 100,000 HD patients. This K24 award with proposed cohort study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue and expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator of training of new investigators in the fields of CKD nutrition & disparities by continuing his liaison with faculty across several campuses, schools and departments within UCLA system including Depts. of Medicine and Pediatrics, Charles-Drew Univ., and UCLA Public Health. (2) Continue and expand his credible efforts in increasing the availability of research participation to minority populations with CKD in Southern California; and (3) Continue to develop a relatively new area of CKD disparity and nutrition research specifically through continued support of the DaVita Clinical Research both in Southern California and across the nation by examining the cohort of Southern dialysis patients and national dialysis cohorts. The data collected and hypotheses generated throughout this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to power additional clinical studies by early career investigators and mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve on patient care.        Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their relationship to nutritional status, diet and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to developing more effective strategies to improve outcomes in dialysis population, other 20 million Americans with CKD, and another 30 to 40 million people who suffer from chronic disease states and wasting disorders including chronic heart failure, chronic lung or liver diseases, terminal malignancy, AIDS, advanced age, and other conditions with cachexia. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important plans.

"Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are less likely to become registered organ donors. In addition, although first-person consent laws have been passed in 48 states, hospitals remain reluctant to harvest organs without the consent of the registered donor's family. Epidemiologic studies on African Americans have focused on the willingness to donate organs. Little research has been done on the positive decision-making process of becoming a registered organ donor. Objectives: The goal of this project is to identify facilitators associated with becoming a registered organ donor and providing familial notification. We hypothesize that positive outcome expectations (physical, social, and self-evaluative) will be associated with increased African American organ donor registration. We also hypothesize that increased perceived self-efficacy (PSE) will be associated with increased familial notification. Design and Methods: Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a guiding framework, a qualitative study involving focus groups will be performed and then validated by large-scale quantitative telephone surveys. African Americans, age 19 and older, who made a decision regarding organ donation at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past 3 months will be stratified into those who chose to become a registered organ donor and those who declined. The dependent variables for analysis will be 1) becoming a registered organ donor and 2) family notification of the decision to become a registered organ donor. Significance: The study will identify the key factors that drive African Americans to become registered organ donors and the determinants of familial notification. This data will inform future interventions to increase African American donor registration and develop mechanisms to ensure family consent, thereby reducing disparities in organ donation and improving the health outcomes of African Americans.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans who registered at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past three months will be stratified into those who chose to be an organ donor and those who declined. A qualitative study involving focus groups and validated by quantitative surveys will be performed to determine the factors associated with the decision of African Americans to become registered organ donors and to inform their families of their donation wishes.        African Americans who registered at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past three months will be stratified into those who chose to be an organ donor and those who declined.

"Understanding Race and Culture in Living Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive kidney transplants, the optimal treatment for ESRD. Race disparities exist in the (a) overall rate of transplantation; (b) type of transplant received [i.e., deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) versus living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT)]; and, (c) early post-transplant health outcomes. One of the best ways to reduce racial disparities in transplantation may be to increase the rate of LDKT among AAs. Although it is known that LDKT is the optimal treatment for ESRD, and that AAs receive LDKTs at much lower rates than whites, the reasons for this disparity among patients already referred for transplant are poorly understood. Further, even among the group of patients who receive LDKT, race disparities in early post- transplant health outcomes persist. Known biological differences associated with race (e.g., presensitization or heightened immune response, donor co-morbid health conditions) do not fully explain the observed racial disparities. Thus, the central goals of this prospective cohort study are to understand (a) the culturally-related and psychosocial factors associated with race disparities in LDKT, and (b) the relationship of those factors with early post-transplant health outcomes in a sample of AA and white transplant candidates. The proposed project will take an interdisciplinary approach in developing a bio-psychosocial model to understand race disparities in LDKT. It will control for demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, SES), and physical health factors (e.g., physical health, co-morbidities, post-transplant adherence) in order to understand the role of culturally-related factors (e.g., medical mistrust, perceived racism and discrimination, religious beliefs, family networks), transplant related beliefs (e.g., knowledge, decision-making factors, transplant attitudes) and psychosocial factors (e.g., depression/anxiety, social support, coping strategies) on race disparities in LDKT. This prospective cohort study will assess patients (n=1775) at two critical time points leading to transplantation (pre-transplant work-up and completion of transplant evaluation), and at 6 months post-transplant. Predictor variables will be assessed via telephone interview at pre-transplant work-up. Whether or not patients completed transplant evaluation will be assessed at the second time-point through medical record abstraction, and patients' perspective of the quantity and quality of interactions with transplant staff will be assessed with a follow-up interview after transplant evaluation is completed. Finally, type of transplant received as well as early post-transplant health outcomes will be assessed using a final follow-up telephone interview, and additional medical record abstraction. Findings from this study are an essential step toward the long-term goal of developing patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post- transplant health outcomes among African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESRD. Because known biological differences do not fully explain the observed racial disparities, this project will examine how culturally-related factors are associated with barriers and facilitators to LDKT and subsequent early post-transplant health outcomes. Findings from this study are needed in order to develop patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post-transplant health outcomes among African Americans.           PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESRD. Because known biological differences do not fully explain the observed racial disparities, this project will examine how culturally-related factors are associated with barriers and facilitators to LDKT and subsequent early post-transplant health outcomes.

"Chronic Kidney Disease Knowledge and Awareness among American Indians DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. The overarching goal of this K23 award is to provide Dr. Stacey Jolly, an Alaska Native academic general internist, with the training, research skills, experience, and professional development to establish an independent program of chronic kidney disease-related research. Her proposed training program consists of three core components: (1) community based and translational research principles; (2) qualitative methods and survey design; and, (3) methodology, implementation, and evaluation of prospective clinical trials. She has proposed formal coursework, tutorials, and practical experience for each of the components. She will learn about and incorporate community based and translational research principles. She will develop new analytic skills in the area of qualitative and mixed methods research. She will learn how to translate rich qualitative data into quantitative approaches, specifically survey development. She will learn how to create culturally and content appropriate chronic kidney disease educational materials in the form of computerized digital stories made by American Indians. She will test this inventive modality in a pilot interventional trial with the aim of increasing chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness and chronic kidney disease protective behaviors among American Indians, as well as assessing feasibility acceptability, and effect size. At the completion, she will be well suited to obtain independent research funding. Her career will advance not only as a physician researcher but in academic medicine as well moving from the Assistant to Associate Professor level. Environment. The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, and its affiliate Case Western Reserve University are the major education and research facilities in Cleveland, OH. Dr. Jolly is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. She will benefit from a rich, multidisciplinary mentorship and training environment, which includes experts in nephrology, qualitative methods, public health, epidemiology, biostatistics, and health disparities research. Dr. Ashwini Sehgal is a Professor of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University and Principal Investigator of the Case Center for Reducing Health Disparities will serve as Dr. Jolly's primary mentor. Dr. Spero Manson is a Professor of Medicine at University of Colorado Denver and Principal Investigator of the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health will serve as a co-mentor. Dr. Cheryl Killion is an Associate Professor of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University and qualitative methods expert will serve as a co-mentor. Dr. Jolly brings together a diverse mentorship team, consultants, and advisory committee members that offer extensive research experience, especially among American Indians, and support of her career development program. The site of her research project and data collection will be in South Dakota in which she will work closely with the Strong Heart Study Dakota Center run by Marcia O'Leary of Missouri Breaks Research Industries, Inc. The Strong Heart Study is a well established NIH/NHLBI funded study. Research Project. The goal of this project is to assess chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness among American Indians in the Northern Plains who have metabolic syndrome. Prior work among the general population and some minority populations adversely affected by chronic kidney disease has shown low knowledge and awareness of the condition. To our knowledge, no study has examined in detail chronic kidney disease knowledge, awareness, and beliefs among American Indians. This study proposes to conduct a series of focus groups and create a chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness survey. Few educational intervention clinical trials have been conducted among those at risk for or with early chronic kidney disease. To our knowledge none have used digital storytelling as a means to deliver the educational messaged and have been conducted among American Indians, a group with high prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease.    The aims of the research project are to:   1) Quantify levels of chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness among American Indians with metabolic syndrome.    2) Determine the effectiveness of a culturally tailored health presentation with computerized digital stories made by American Indians compared to a conventional health video presentation only for improving chronic kidney disease knowledge and factors thought to be preventative of chronic kidney disease or its progression at baseline and follow-up in a pilot clinical intervention trial.    In summary, with this K23 award, Dr. Jolly will be able to focus the majority of her time and effort on career development and research to acquire the advanced training and receive the critical mentorship needed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is a chronic medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and a public health problem. Chronic kidney disease can lead to kidneys failing and needing to be on a dialysis kidney machine or have a kidney transplant. It seems a lot of people do not know they have chronic kidney disease or are at risk for getting chronic kidney disease. We want to understand this better and develop ways to help people, specifically American Indians, who have a high burden of chronic kidney disease.",Chronic Kidney Disease Knowledge and Awareness

"Impact of Vitamin D on Diabetic Kidney Disease in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic kidney disease is increasing in prevalence and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Health disparities exist in the progression of diabetic kidney disease, with minorities being more affected even when adjusting for treatment, glycemic and hypertensive control, and medical coverage. Secondary prevention of the progression of diabetic kidney disease is hindered by a lack of easily modifiable risk factors. Based on animal and observational studies, vitamin D deficiency is potentially a novel, modifiable risk factor that may interrupt or delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease through direct effects as well as by helping to ameliorate kidney disease risk factors, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension and inflammation. In addition, based on minorities having a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, it may also potentially impact the differential progression of diabetic kidney disease in minorities. However, clinical trials evaluating the impact of vitamin D supplementation on diabetic kidney disease are lacking. Thus, this pilot study has the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation (vitamin D3 at 400 IU/d versus supplementation of 4000 IU/d) on the proportion of African Americans with progression of albuminuria over 12 months and 2) to identify whether kidney disease risk factors such as blood pressure and glycemic control mediate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of albuminuria over 12 months.   We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 102 African American adults ?=18 years old) with vitamin D deficiency, previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes and stage 1 or 2 chronic kidney disease receiving usual care for their diabetes. After a 3 month run-in period of vitamin D supplementation, we will follow participants for an additional 12 months. This pilot will provide relevant information to be used to design a larger randomized, controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Based on current health disparities and vitamin D's biologic mechanisms of action, vitamin D deficiency has the possibility of being a novel, modifiable risk factor that could be added to usual care to decrease health disparities by delaying the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Since much information is unknown regarding the role of Vitamin D in diabetic kidney disease due to the lack of human studies, this pilot study is an important first step towards evaluating the potential impact of this intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetic kidney disease is increasing in prevalence and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D deficiency is potentially a novel, modifiable risk factor that could delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Minorities have been shown to have a higher prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency and are more affected by health disparities that exist in the progression of kidney disease. Due to a lack of clinical trials and human studies, the role of vitamin D in the delaying the progression of early stage diabetic kidney disease is unknown. This project is an attempt to determine the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the progression of early stage diabetic kidney disease.

"TAILORED COMPUTER EDUCATION TO INCREASE LIVING DONATION IN AFRICAN-AMERICANS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney transplantation offers patients in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 3 to 17 additional years of life and improved quality-of-life compared to remaining on dialysis. Because of the deceased donor organ shortage, more kidney patients are choosing to receive kidneys from family and friends, a process called living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Although African-Americans are 3.7 times more likely to develop ESRD, they are less likely to receive LDKTs. Therefore, this project will assess whether racial disparities in transplant knowledge, readiness to pursue LDKT, completion of transplant medical evaluation, and receipt of LDKTs can be reduced when ESRD patients receive access to personalized coaching and individually-tailored feedback using an Explore Transplant computerized Expert System. This multilevel study will also examine how other known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT impact the Expert System's effectiveness. ESRD patients presenting for transplant medical evaluation at Barnes-Jewish Transplant Center in St. Louis, Missouri (465 African-Americans, 465 Whites) will be stratified by race and randomized to one of two education conditions (Explore Transplant Expert System vs. Standard Education Control). As they complete transplant medical evaluation, patients in the Expert System condition will receive individually tailored feedback reports and personalized coaching addressing variables important to behavior change and associated with LDKT health disparities. Control patients will only receive standard-of-care education provided by the transplant center. Changes in key outcomes will be assessed at four time points (2-months before in-hospital evaluation day (IHED) (baseline), 2- and 6-months post-IHED, and 18-months post-baseline). The grant has four aims:  Aim 1 (Primary): Compared to the Control Group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System increase in their LDKT readiness and transplant knowledge 6-months post-IHED.  Aim 2: Compared to the Control group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System are more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT 18- months post-baseline.  Aim 3: To examine whether the Expert System's effectiveness in changing LDKT decision-making and behavior is equivalent between African-Americans and Whites.  Aim 4: To examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with the Expert System to affect African-Americans' decision-making and behavior.  At the conclusion of the study, we will have developed an innovative and cost-effective Explore Transplant Expert System that could be utilized by providers in 5,000 dialysis and 250 transplant centers to tailor LDKT discussion and education based on the needs of individual patients of different races.        Patients with kidney failure have better health and quality-of-life when they receive a transplant, especially a transplant from a living donor (LDKT). Although kidney failure disproportionately affects African-Americans, Whites are more likely to receive LDKTs. This randomized controlled trial of 930 African-American and White patients will develop and assess the effectiveness of individually tailored, computer-generated education using an Expert System for overcoming specific barriers affecting African-Americans' pursuit of LDKT.

"Myeloablative T- Replete Haploidentical PBSCT for Patients Without MRD or MUD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many patients, particularly those from ethnic minorities, are unable to access the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation due to the lack of a suitable donor. For such patients, umbilical cord blood can offer an alternative source of hematopoietic cells. However, adults typically require the concurrent use of two cord blood units (DCBT) at considerable expense. In adults such transplants are also associated with delayed immune reconstitution, increased rate of infections and a higher treatment related mortality than transplants from conventional donors. Recently the use of haploidentical (partially matched related donor) hematopoietic cell transplants (haplo-HCT) using T-cell-replete marrow grafts and post- transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have been shown to produce high rates of engraftment and low treatment related mortality (TRM) when used with a non-myeloablative preparative regimen, in patients who lack conventional donors. However, such transplants have limited efficacy in aggressive/advanced myeloid malignancies because of a high relapse rate. In an institutional pilot trial, we have assessed the use of T- replete mobilized peripheral blood (PBSC) and a myeloablative preparative regimen with haplo-HCT + PTCy. Despite the advanced and high-risk nature of the malignancies treated, estimated 6 month TRM was 14% and disease-free survival was 72%. All patients engrafted and developed full donor chimerism in CD3+ and CD33+ cells by day +30. A multi-institutional phase II trial is therefore proposed within the BMT CTN to confirm these encouraging results. The proposed trial will test the hypothesis that this novel approach to myeloablative haplo-HCT is safe and effective when used in a multi-institutional setting. Upon successful completion of this phase II trial, a randomized phase 111 comparison is proposed between this approach to haplo-HCT and myeloablative DCBT. The objective of this phase 111 study will be to directly compare these two approaches to alternative donor transplantation with respect to safety, toxicity, efficacy, cost and immune reconstitution. This trial would definitively determine the best option for myeloablative transplantation in patients with advanced malionancies who lack a matched-sibling or matched unrelated donor RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed research addresses a significant current deficiency in public health. Specifically, it tests a novel strategy that will enable curative myeloablative blood stem cell transplants in patients (particularly those from underserved minorities) who are currently unable to access them due to lack of a conventional donor. If successful, it will transform the standard-of-care by offering life-saving therapy to patients who would have died from their cancer and close a major disparity in healthcare access for ethnic minorities.

"APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop kidney failure at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently, we discovered two coding sequence variants in ApolipoproteinL1 (APOL1) that account for a large proportion of this major health disparity. APOL1 kidney disease variants have a major impact on multiple different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Risk inheritance is recessive: individuals with two variant APOL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. We predict that more than 3.5 million African Americans have the high-risk APOL1 genotype. The presence of two risk alleles does not lead to kidney disease in all individuals, indicating that other genetic and environmental factors are important modifiers. Understanding why some individuals with the high-risk genotype develop kidney disease while others do not will improve risk stratification and may illuminate the pathways most amenable to therapy. We therefore propose to: Aim 1: Identify additional genetic modifiers at the APOL1 gene locus. Our data suggest that APOL1 kidney disease risk variants are gain-of- function alleles. Since not all individuals with two risk alleles develop disease, other local polymorphisms may regulate expression of APOL1, modulating the effect of the disease-causing APOL1 coding mutations. We will define structural variants that may alter APOL1 gene expression, and test their effects on the penetrance of the two disease-causing alleles. We will test whether polymorphisms in transcription factor and microRNA binding sites affect the penetrance of these APOL1 risk alleles. Aim 2: Find epistatic modifiers of APOL1 penetrance. The APOL1 renal risk variants increased in frequency in Africa, at least in part, because they provided protection against trypanosomes. We hypothesize that additional genetic loci is simultaneously selected that protect against renal injury from the major coding risk alleles, and that the protective effect of these loci may have diminished after admixture with Europeans. Here, we will perform a genome-wide screen for polymorphisms that may protect against or exacerbate APOL1 variant-induced renal injury. We will identify proteins that bind differentially to wild type and coding variant ApoL1, as these binding partners may modulate injury caused by the risk variants. Aim 3: Identify biochemical modifiers of APOL1-mediated renal disease. ApoL1 kidney disease risk variants may be most deleterious in the setting of additional risk factors. Here, we explore how two important factors may interact with APOL1 genotype to cause renal disease. Vitamin D is believed to be protective against renal injury, while certain lipid profiles may promote injury. We ask whether these molecules alter APOL1 biology in vitro, and whether biochemical levels of these mediators predict which individuals with the APOL1 risk genotype are likely to develop kidney disease.              8. Project Narrative We have recently found that specific genetic variants in the APOL1 gene account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We now want to understand the factors that combine with the high risk APOL1 genotype to cause overt kidney disease. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number of people with this serious public health problem and for reducing the very large disparity in the rates of kidney disease.",APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease,8282062,R01MD007092,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Gene Expression ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' In Vitro ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' United States ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Yeasts ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Renal glomerular syndrome ', ' Renal glomerular disorder ', ' Renal glomerular disease or syndrome ', ' Renal Glomerular Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Glomerular disease ', ' Renal glomerular disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Penetrance ', ' American ', ' Yeast One/Two-Hybrid System ', ' Yeast One Hybrid System ', ' Two Hybrid ', ' yeast two hybrid system ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Other Genetics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' protective effect ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' gain of function ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2012,435000,0.05592116064980004
"Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities ae disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. The factors responsible for this disparity are complex and incompletely understood. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing number of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient- Oriented Research provides a unique mechanism to assist established investigators to attract and retain talented new physician-scientists to careers in patient-oriented research. The candidate for this K24 is James Lash, MD, an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Lash's research focuses on the epidemiology of CKD with a particular emphasis on minority populations. He has considerable experience as a patient- oriented researcher and is the Principal Investigator for two NIDDK-sponsored studies: 1) the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study and 2) the Hispanic CRIC Study. These studies, as well as several other multicenter collaborative studies, provide a wealth of opportunities for trainees. Dr. Lash has developed a solid track record for mentoring young investigators, including a significant number from minority backgrounds. The new research program funded by this award is a natural extension of Dr. Lash's ongoing work and will provide additional opportunities for trainees. It consists of two projects which focus on potential factors contributing to disparities in adults and children with CKD: 1) individual/neighborhood socioeconomic status, and 2) health literacy. This proposed research leverages the infrastructure of two large ongoing cohort studies (the CRIC Study and Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study) and therefore, provides a unique opportunity to examine these factors in both children and adults with CKD. In addition to mentored research, trainees will participate in didactic training through the UIC K30 Clinical Research Training Program and have access to the extensive resources and infrastructure provided by the UIC Center for Clinical Translational Science (CCTS), the UIC School of Public Health, and the UIC P60 Center for Excellence in Health Disparities. This K24 award will provide Dr. Lash with the additional time and resources to amplify his efforts in contributing to our understanding of health disparities in CKD and in training new physician scientists to become independent investigators in kidney disease research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by this chronic condition.

"Racial Differences in Phosphorus Metabolism in Health and in Kidney Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Candidate: Orlando Gutierrez received his MD from the University of Toledo, and completed his Internal Medicine Residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is currently a clinical and research fellow in nephrology at MGH, and a candidate for a Master's degree in human physiological investigation from Harvard Medical School. Mentor: Dr. David Nathan is a renowned clinical investigator who has trained numerous investigators in patient-oriented clinical research. Dr. Nathan will ensure the success of Dr. Gutierrez's research training, project, and overall career development. Research: Blacks with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progress to end stage renal disease and develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) more rapidly than Whites. The mechanisms that underlie these disparities remain elusive. Hyperphosphatemia is linked with both accelerated kidney and CVD progression. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) are the primary hormones that regulate serum phosphate (Pi) levels. Preliminary data from our group indicate that Blacks with CKD have a higher prevalence of hyperphosphatemia than Whites at all levels of glomerular filtration rate despite higher PTH levels, suggesting that Blacks have impaired Pi excreting capacity. Impaired Pi excretion may represent a novel risk factor for faster kidney and CV disease progression in Blacks. However, no studies have examined differences in Pi handling by race. For Aim 1, we will examine racial differences in gut and renal Pi handling by measuring (1) gut Pi absorption after a fixed Pi meal and (2) dynamic changes in urinary Pi excretion in response to oral Pi loading in healthy Blacks vs. Whites. For Aim 2, we will examine racial differences in hormonal reguation of Pi metabolism by comparing (1) the phosphaturic effect of synthetic PTH infusion and (2) dynamic changes in FGF-23 levels after oral Pi loading in healthy Blacks vs. Whites. For Aim 3, we will examine racial differences in Pi handling in CKD by measuring urinary Pi excretion in response to dietary Pi loading in Blacks vs. Whites with CKD. We will then compare any differences in CKD to those seen in healthy individuals. We believe the results of these studies will provide critical new insights into racial differences in Pi metabolism that may help elucidate racial disparities in CKD outcomes with important public health implications. A K23 award will allow Dr. Gutierrez to attain new skills in clinical investigation and develop into an independent clinical investigator.

"Blood Donor Drives & High School Students to Educate People About Organ Donation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main limiting factor for organ transplantation is a deficiency of available organs. The shortage of available organs is especially severe for African-Americans, and to a lesser extent Hispanics. Blood donors are an inherently altruistic group, but no studies have addressed whether blood donors would be more willing to sign on as organ donors than non- blood donors. Almost all blood banks now conduct blood drives in high schools, and, in San Diego, 21% of blood donated to the San Diego Blood Bank comes from high school blood drives. These drives are organized and conducted by high school students, with assistance and supervision by blood bank officials. We propose to have high school students ask blood donors and non-blood donors to sign on to the California Department of Motor Vehicles organ donor program, which can be done quickly and easily on-line. We will conduct the study in high schools and communities that have a high percentage of African-Americans and Hispanics. Our primary hypothesis is that blood donors will be more willing to sign on as blood donors than non-blood donors. After being asked to sign on as an organ donor, participating subjects will partake in a short 10 minute educational session about organ donation led by a high school student. The subjects will then again be asked to sign on as an organ donor. Our secondary hypotheses are that the educational session will increase the number of subjects who will sign on as an organ donor, and that the effect will be greater in blood donors than non-blood donors. The educational materials will be culturally sensitive, as they will be developed by a team of three to five students that will include at least one African-American and one Hispanic student. If this program is successful, it could easily be disseminated widely throughout the United States, and we demonstrate that it could increase markedly the number of organs donated by African-Americans and Hispanics.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The number of people who are candidates for organ transplantation far exceeds the number of organ donors; this imbalance is particularly critical for minority groups such as African-Americans. We propose to determine if high school students can increase the interest of blood donors in their communities in becoming organ donors. If successful, this study could point to a method to markedly reduce the disparity between the number of organ donors and organ recipients.                  The number of people who are candidates for organ transplantation far exceeds the number of organ donors; this imbalance is particularly critical for minority groups such as African-Americans.

"Chronic Kidney Disease in Disadvantaged Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Yoshio Hall, an Assistant Professor in nephrology at the University of Washington. Dr. Hall is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in medically underserved populations. This K23 award will provide Dr. Hall with training and mentored research experience in the following areas: (1) recruiting and maintaining a patient cohort; (2) performing and validating diagnostic tests; (3) developing and maintaining a CKD registry from multiple data sources; (4) training in health information technology, (5) training in advanced statistical and epidemiologic methods; and (6) designing pilot intervention studies. To achieve these goals, Dr. Hall has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Jonathan Himmelfarb, Director of the Kidney Research Institute and Professor of Medicine, who is recognized internationally as a leader in translational and outcomes research in persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and acute kidney injury, and two co-mentors: Dr. Edward Boyko, Acting Head of the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Washington and former Director of the VA-funded Epidemiologic Research and Information Center, who is an internationally known investigator in the epidemiology of diabetes and obesity with extensive experience in disease registry development and management; and Dr. Glenn Chertow, Chief of Nephrology and Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, who is internationally recognized as a leader in improving care for persons with acute and chronic kidney disease . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health problem which affects more than 26 million Americans. In the US, members of racial-ethnic minority groups and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of CKD, particularly ESRD. We hypothesize that the disparate rates of ESRD among these at-risk groups reflect a pattern of underutilization of care. We further hypothesize that public health systems which disproportionately care for diverse populations do not consistently identify or provide recommended care to persons with CKD who are at highest risk for progressive disease. We will test these hypotheses using a series of analyses that leverage data from (1) Harborview Medical Center, the largest public hospital system in the northwestern United States; and (2) The Community Health Network, a large safety net health system in northern California. This research will form the basis for patient-centered interventions to improve the delivery of care to diverse populations. Public health relevance: Improved understanding of local- and system-level barriers to care delivery in historically disadvantaged populations may reduce pervasive racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in care and decrease the growing burden of CKD and ESRD to society.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is defined as the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or loss of kidney function. In the United States, chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 27 million Americans and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and cost. In this country, racial-ethnic minority groups and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of chronic kidney disease, particularly end-stage renal disease. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that modifiable local- and system-level factors can be identified which influence the delivery of care and impact long-term risk for development and progression of chronic kidney disease to ESRD among disadvantaged populations.

"Understanding Race and Culture in Living Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive kidney transplants, the optimal treatment for ESRD. Race disparities exist in the (a) overall rate of transplantation; (b) type of transplant received [i.e., deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) versus living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT)]; and, (c) early post-transplant health outcomes. One of the best ways to reduce racial disparities in transplantation may be to increase the rate of LDKT among AAs. Although it is known that LDKT is the optimal treatment for ESRD, and that AAs receive LDKTs at much lower rates than whites, the reasons for this disparity among patients already referred for transplant are poorly understood. Further, even among the group of patients who receive LDKT, race disparities in early post- transplant health outcomes persist. Known biological differences associated with race (e.g., presensitization or heightened immune response, donor co-morbid health conditions) do not fully explain the observed racial disparities. Thus, the central goals of this prospective cohort study are to understand (a) the culturally-related and psychosocial factors associated with race disparities in LDKT, and (b) the relationship of those factors with early post-transplant health outcomes in a sample of AA and white transplant candidates. The proposed project will take an interdisciplinary approach in developing a bio-psychosocial model to understand race disparities in LDKT. It will control for demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, SES), and physical health factors (e.g., physical health, co-morbidities, post-transplant adherence) in order to understand the role of culturally-related factors (e.g., medical mistrust, perceived racism and discrimination, religious beliefs, family networks), transplant related beliefs (e.g., knowledge, decision-making factors, transplant attitudes) and psychosocial factors (e.g., depression/anxiety, social support, coping strategies) on race disparities in LDKT. This prospective cohort study will assess patients (n=1775) at two critical time points leading to transplantation (pre-transplant work-up and completion of transplant evaluation), and at 6 months post-transplant. Predictor variables will be assessed via telephone interview at pre-transplant work-up. Whether or not patients completed transplant evaluation will be assessed at the second time-point through medical record abstraction, and patients' perspective of the quantity and quality of interactions with transplant staff will be assessed with a follow-up interview after transplant evaluation is completed. Finally, type of transplant received as well as early post-transplant health outcomes will be assessed using a final follow-up telephone interview, and additional medical record abstraction. Findings from this study are an essential step toward the long-term goal of developing patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post- transplant health outcomes among African Americans.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESRD. Because known biological differences do not fully explain the observed racial disparities, this project will examine how culturally-related factors are associated with barriers and facilitators to LDKT and subsequent early post-transplant health outcomes. Findings from this study are needed in order to develop patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post-transplant health outcomes among African Americans.

"Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are less likely to become registered organ donors. In addition, although first-person consent laws have been passed in 48 states, hospitals remain reluctant to harvest organs without the consent of the registered donor's family. Epidemiologic studies on African Americans have focused on the willingness to donate organs. Little research has been done on the positive decision-making process of becoming a registered organ donor. Objectives: The goal of this project is to identify facilitators associated with becoming a registered organ donor and providing familial notification. We hypothesize that positive outcome expectations (physical, social, and self-evaluative) will be associated with increased African American organ donor registration. We also hypothesize that increased perceived self-efficacy (PSE) will be associated with increased familial notification. Design and Methods: Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a guiding framework, a qualitative study involving focus groups will be performed and then validated by large-scale quantitative telephone surveys. African Americans, age 19 and older, who made a decision regarding organ donation at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past 3 months will be stratified into those who chose to become a registered organ donor and those who declined. The dependent variables for analysis will be 1) becoming a registered organ donor and 2) family notification of the decision to become a registered organ donor. Significance: The study will identify the key factors that drive African Americans to become registered organ donors and the determinants of familial notification. This data will inform future interventions to increase African American donor registration and develop mechanisms to ensure family consent, thereby reducing disparities in organ donation and improving the health outcomes of African Americans.      African Americans who registered at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past three months will be stratified into those who chose to be an organ donor and those who declined. A qualitative study involving focus groups and validated by quantitative surveys will be performed to determine the factors associated with the decision of African Americans to become registered organ donors and to inform their families of their donation wishes.

"Gender Disparities and Vascular Function in Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is Ana C. Ricardo, MD, MPH, a nephrologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Ricardo's short-term goals are to gain experience and develop skills by conducting research focused on gender disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the contribution of gender differences in endothelial function to these disparities. Her long-term career goals are to become an independent investigator conducting research focused on reducing health inequalities in CKD through lifestyle interventions. To achieve her goals, Dr. Ricardo has assembled a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentored research and didactic coursework at the UIC School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's strong team of mentors and collaborators includes world-class experts with longstanding NIH funding and extensive mentorship experience. Her primary mentor, James P. Lash, MD, is an expert in the epidemiology of CKD in minority populations; Martha L. Daviglus, MD, PhD, her co-mentor, has expertise in the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. The proposal also includes a multidisciplinary team of collaborators with expertise in the areas of women's health, longitudinal data analyses, and the influence of exercise on vascular function. Dr. Ricardo's successful development into an independent physician-scientist will be facilitated by the extensive facilities and resources available at UIC which include the Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Center for Research on Women and Gender, and the School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's research will advance her skills in both primary data collection and longitudinal data analyses. The proposal leverages the infrastructure of the NIH- funded Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, a large and diverse observational study of adults with CKD. Evidence suggests that there are significant gender-related disparities in CKD. Whereas data from the United States Renal Data System indicate that men have 1.5 times greater incidence of end-stage renal disease, a higher prevalence of CKD in women was seen in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Several studies suggest that men have more rapid CKD progression, but this has not been a consistent finding. Furthermore, previous studies were not designed to address this question and included few racial/ethnic minorities. In the general population, there is evidence that differential rates of cardiovascular outcomes in women and men may be related to gender differences in endothelial function, which have been in part attributed to the protective effect of estrogen in women. Moreover, limited data suggest that endothelial dysfunction may be a predictor of CKD progression. However, the contribution of endothelial function to gender disparities in CKD progression is not known. This is an area of significance because studies of non-CKD populations suggest that endothelial function may be improved with pharmacologic therapy (e.g., ACE- inhibitors) or lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise). The specific aims for the proposed project are to 1) Examine gender disparities in kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in the CRIC Study; 2) Examine gender differences in endothelial function and the role of endothelial function as a predictor of CKD progression in 150 University of Illinois CRIC Study participants; and 3) Evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week pilot resistance exercise training intervention and its effect on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This Career Development Award will provide the foundation for Dr. Ricardo to pursue an independent research career dedicated to reducing health disparities in CKD.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem in the U.S. and evidence suggests that outcomes are different for men and women with CKD. The aims of this proposal are to 1) Identify modifiable factors responsible for gender disparities in CKD outcomes; 2) Evaluate the impact of vascular function on gender disparities in CKD progression; and 3) Conduct a pilot study evaluating the effect of resistance exercise on vascular function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This research will fill important gaps in our knowledge and potentially lead to the development of targeted interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with CKD.        ",Gender Disparities and

"Racial and Cardiovascular Risk Factor Anomalies in CKD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving maintenance dialysis therapy the proportion of African American patients is significantly higher compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts, and traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and obesity show seemingly anomalous, inverse associations with adverse outcomes. The exceptionally high prevalence of end- stage renal disease (ESRD) among African Americans is likely a result of the complex interaction of their higher rates of CKD incidence and/or faster CKD progression, lower mortality, and lower likelihood of kidney transplantation. The anomalous cardiovascular risk factor profile in ESRD could be the result of short-term competing risks related to malnutrition and inflammation, with the seemingly unfavorable traditional cardiovascular risk factors associating with a better nutritional state, which could differentially affect African Americans an hence provide one explanation for their better survival in ESRD. Whether similar paradoxical differences in mortality rates in non-dialysis dependent CKD stages exist is not clear; their presence, extent, the CKD stage of its occurrence and their mechanisms of action all need to be clarified in sufficient detail to allow for the design of proper diagnostic and interventional strategies towards cardiovascular risk reduction and towards alleviating racial disparities in outcomes. In the spirit of PA-09-196 we will utilize data obtained from the national VA research database which is the only large administrative database with detailed socio-demographic and clinical information on very large numbers of individuals (over 4 million individuals including ove 0.5 million with CKD) across all parts of the US. We will examine the population-wide dynamic effects of incident CKD and mortality on racial composition and on changes in cardiovascular risk factor profiles by examining longitudinally a cohort of patients with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate. We will explore the effects of various socio-demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, biochemical measurements and medication use on mortality and progressive CKD using complex epidemiologic methods including joint modeling to assess the effect of longitudinal changes in risk factor parameters on mortality and marginal structural models in order to adjust for both baseline and time-dependent confounders. This three-year project will generate a wealth of information to more reliably examine the above hypotheses related to racial and cardiovascular discrepancies in the outcomes of patients with all levels of kidney function that could have significant public health implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CKD is a prototype for a chronic disease state and is recognized as a global epidemic and a Healthy People 2020 priority area. It is also now recognized as a CVD risk factor and most studies suggest the presence of CKD is a more powerful predictor of CV events than all traditional CV risk factors with the possible exceptions of diabetes and hypertension. Advancing our understanding of the changes in mortality risk profile from normal eGFR to advancing stages of CKD will yield invaluable insights into socio-cultural, clinical and biologic influences on mortality risk and how they interact during the development of a chronic disease state. Given the role of chronic diseases on both the personal and financial burden to our nation, this study is designed to enhance our understanding of chronic disease prevention and early intervention, and ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.            ",Racial and Cardiovascular Risk Factor Anomalies in CKD,8532600,R01DK096920,"['Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anemia ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' bone ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Evolution ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Malnutrition ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' alternative treatment ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2013,309736,0.11064997614576702
"Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but large racial disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. In 2009, Blacks, who comprised 36.9% of the dialysis population, received 32.4% of deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKTs) but just 13.7% of LDKTs. A multi- component intervention that addresses the many barriers that impede LDKT (e.g. transplant candidates' lack of knowledge about LDKT; fears regarding donor's future health; guilt; and discomfort with discussing LDKT) could plausibly increase LDKT among Blacks. Our main objective is to test an educational and behavioral intervention that is designed to increase receipt of LDKT among newly-listed transplant candidates who are Black. We hypothesize that a multi-component intervention will increase both readiness to pursue LDKT and actual receipt of LDKTs among Blacks. We propose a parallel group, two-arm randomized trial among 500 Black kidney transplant candidates. After Blacks are placed on the waiting list for a DDKT, we will randomly assign them to either: (1) a control group that will receive Usual Care, or (2) an Intervention group that will receive a culturally sensitive, group-based intervention. Participants randomized to the Intervention will be asked to attend a 60-90 minute small group seminar (family and friends strongly encouraged to attend) that will feature brief talks regarding: basic facts about CKD, transplant, and the waiting list; basic facts about live kidney donation; the experience of receiving a transplant and LDKT; the experience of serving as a live kidney donor; and skill-building regarding how to ask for a live donor. These talks will directly address the barriers that impede LDKT. Physicians and Black LDKT recipients and live donors will lead these talks, supplemented by educational videos. In our preparatory aim, we will develop the Intervention and train the speakers. Our primary aim will compare LDKT readiness and LDKT receipt in the Intervention vs. Usual Care groups of our randomized clinical trial; our primary outcome is change in readiness to pursue LDKT, and our main secondary outcome is actual receipt of LDKT, after 18 months of follow-up. Our secondary aims will determine (a) the social and behavioral variables that modify the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt; and (b) whether changes in social and behavioral factors mediate the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. This clinical trial will occur at two neighboring transplant centers that share the same policies, procedures, and personnel. In an average year, these two centers combine to place over 200 Blacks on the DDKT waiting list and perform over 135 LDKTs (including ~29 among Blacks). By intervening upon patients ""distal"" in the transplant process, at two centers that perform many LDKTs, we have excellent power to detect a beneficial effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. At the end of this study, we will have developed and tested a culturally sensitive educational and behavioral Intervention that has the potential to increase receipt of LDKT among Blacks and decrease the striking racial disparities in receipt of LDKT.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blacks with kidney failure are much less likely to receive a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which is usually the best treatment for kidney failure. We propose a randomized clinical trial to test an intervention consisting of practical but potent educational seminars that will feature video-based modules and ""live"" talks by physicians, LDKT recipients, and live donors. Among 500 kidney transplant candidates who are Black and newly activated on the transplant waiting list, our trial will determine whether this Intervention (compared to Usual Care) increases readiness for and receipt of LDKT.            ",Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist,8554362,R01DK098744,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Guilt ', ' Health ', ' Israel ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Friends ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Policies ', ' Saints ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' volunteer ', ' stem ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,ST.

"CKD-Targeted Analyses of the Jackson Heart Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects over 26 million Americans. Racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence and incidence of CKD. For example, nationally representative data demonstrate that 19.4% of all African Americans have CKD stage 3 or above, and the most recent data on endstage renal disease (ESRD) indicate African Americans have the highest prevalence and incidence of ESRD in the United States. Unique social, cultural, and behavioral characteristics as well as novel biologic risk factors may contribute to the development and progression of CKD in African Americans, but these pathways have not been adequately defined. The goal of the current grant application is to develop a chronic kidney disease (CKD) working group to evaluate CKD and CKD risk factors among the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohorts, to assess risk factors for the progression of CKD and development of endstage renal disease (ESRD), and to determine the influence of CKD on development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Although much is known regarding disparities in the incidence of ESRD, less is known regarding the contribution of differences in novel biologic, behavioral, and social/cultural risk factors to the development of CKD in African Americans. JHS will provide a NIH-funded cohort with which to study the association of CKD and CVD outcomes and death among a population of African Americans. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1: Develop infrastructure for a highly-functioning diverse, national CKD working group for the Jackson Heart Study with expertise in health disparities, epidemiology, and biostatistics; Aim 2: Examine the association of novel and traditional risk factors for CKD, progression of CKD, and ESRD in the JHS cohort. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationship of CKD with traditional CVD risk factors, intermediate cardiac outcomes, incident CVD and death in the JHS cohort.  This research will develop 1) the infrastructure for a successful productive CKD working group, 2) a research agenda that will elucidate determinants of development, progression and outcomes of CKD in the JHS and 3) a future workforce capable of conducting high quality research on the interrelationship of CKD and CVD, thereby improving the public health of African Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE STATEMENT Background and Rationale: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an important public health problem due its high prevalence, morbidity, and poor health outcomes. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected with CKD and currently, African Americans have the highest incidence of kidney failure in the world and are less likely to be transplanted. Identification of reversible risk factors early in the course of disease would help to identify and target patients who are at high risk for potential interventions. This application will develop the infrastructure or a national Jackson Heart Study CKD working group that will evaluate novel and non-traditional risk factors for CKD. To that end the specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop infrastructure for a highly-functioning diverse, national CKD working group for the Jackson Heart Study with expertise in health disparities, epidemiology, and biostatistics; Aim 2: Examine the association of novel and traditional risk factors for CKD, progression of CKD, and ESRD in the JHS cohort. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationship of CKD with traditional CVD risk factors, intermediate cardiac outcomes, incident CVD and death in the JHS cohort. This research will develop 1) the infrastructure for a successful productive CKD working group, 2) a research agenda that will elucidate determinants of development, progression and outcomes of CKD in the JHS and 3) a future workforce capable of conducting high quality research on the interrelationship of CKD and CVD, thereby improving the public health of African Americans.            ",CKD-Targeted Analyses of the Jackson Heart Study,8440688,R01DK102134,"['Corticotropin (1-39) ', ' Adrenocorticotropin ', ' Adrenocorticotropic Hormone ', ' ACTH (1-39) ', ' ACTH ', ' Corticotropin ', ' Affect ', ' Pregn-4-en-18-al, 11,21-dihydroxy-3,20-dioxo-, (11beta)- ', ' Aldosterone ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Angiotensins ', ' Hydrogen Carbonates ', ' HCO3 ', ' Bicarbonates ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease  SUMMARY More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop kidney failure at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently, we discovered two coding sequence variants in ApolipoproteinL1 (APOL1) that account for a large proportion of this major health disparity. APOL1 kidney disease variants have a major impact on multiple different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Risk inheritance is recessive: individuals with two variant APOL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. We predict that more than 3.5 million African Americans have the high risk APOL1 genotype. The presence of two risk alleles does not lead to kidney disease in all individuals, indicating that other genetic and environmental factors are important modifiers. Understanding why some individuals with the high-risk genotype develop kidney disease while others do not will improve risk stratification and may illuminate the pathways most amenable to therapy. We therefore propose to: Aim 1: Identify additional genetic modifiers at the APOL1 gene locus. Our data suggest that APOL1 kidney disease risk variants are gain-of- function alleles. Since not all individuals with two risk alleles develop disease, other local polymorphisms may regulate expression of APOL1, modulating the effect of the disease-causing APOL1 coding mutations. We will define structural variants that may alter APOL1 gene expression, and test their effects on the penetrance of the two disease-causing alleles. We will test whether polymorphisms in transcription factor and microRNA binding sites affect the penetrance of these APOL1 risk alleles. Aim 2: Find epistatic modifiers of APOL1 penetrance. The APOL1 renal risk variants increased in frequency in Africa, at least in part, because they provided protection against trypanosomes. We hypothesize that additional genetic loci were simultaneously selected that protect against renal injury from the major coding risk alleles, and that the protective effect of these loci may have diminished after admixture with Europeans. Here, we will perform a genome-wide screen for polymorphisms that may protect against or exacerbate APOL1 variant-induced renal injury. We will identify proteins that bind differentially to wild type and coding variant ApoL1, as these binding partners may modulate injury caused by the risk variants. Aim 3: Identify biochemical modifiers of APOL1-mediated renal disease. ApoL1 kidney disease risk variants may be most deleterious in the setting of additional risk factors. Here, we explore how two important factors may interact with APOL1 genotype to cause renal disease. Vitamin D is believed to be protective against renal injury, while certain lipid profiles may promote injury. We ask whether these molecules alter APOL1 biology in vitro, and whether biochemical levels of these mediators predict which individuals with the APOL1 risk genotype are likely to develop kidney disease.  8. Project Narrative We have recently found that specific genetic variants in the APOL1 gene account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We now want to understand the factors that combine with the high risk APOL1 genotype to cause overt kidney disease. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number of people with this serious public health problem and for reducing the very large disparity in the rates of kidney disease.",APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease,8451330,R01MD007092,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Gene Expression ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' In Vitro ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' United States ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Yeasts ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Glomerular disease ', ' Renal glomerular syndrome ', ' Renal glomerular disorder ', ' Renal glomerular disease or syndrome ', ' Renal Glomerular Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Renal glomerular disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Penetrance ', ' American ', ' Yeast One/Two-Hybrid System ', ' Yeast One Hybrid System ', ' Two Hybrid ', ' yeast two hybrid system ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Other Genetics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' protective effect ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' gain of function ', ' high risk ', ' risk variant ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2013,406725,0.05601613153438291
"House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While kidney transplantation is the best treatment option for adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), profound racial and socioeconomic disparities persist. Minorities and low-income patients, for instance, are less likely to receive lve donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), which yields better survival, quality of life, and health care cost outcomes than chronic dialysis or deceased donor transplantation. Guided by a socio- ecological model of LDKT, the PI developed an innovative House Calls intervention that has shown to be effective at overcoming barriers and increasing LDKT rates in Black patients. We now seek to expand the reach and intensity of the House Calls intervention by including other minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and by adding a novel Patient-Centered Decision Support component. Also, little is known about those variables that mediate the intervention's impact on the occurrence of LDKT or whether the intervention can attenuate the growing gender disparity in living donation. In this study, we will pursue three specific aims: (1) evaluate the differential benefit of adding a patient-centered decision support component to the House Calls intervention; (2) identify mediators of the relationship between the interventions and the occurrence of LDKT; and (3) examine whether the House Calls intervention reduces the gender disparity in rates of living kidney donation. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a single-site, randomized controlled trial with a planned enrollment of 100 minority and low income patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Patients will be randomized to receive the House Calls intervention alone (HC) or the House Calls intervention + a web-based Patient-Centered Decision Support intervention (HC+DS). The central hypothesis is that, compared to HC alone, the HC+DS group will have a higher proportion of enrolled patients with LDKT by the 2-yr study endpoint (primary outcome) and higher proportions of enrolled patients with at least one live donor inquiry, at least one live donor evaluation, and in LDKT action (vs. contemplation) stages (secondary outcomes). Also, we will evaluate whether the House Calls intervention (either HC alone or HC+DS) leads to more donor inquiries, evaluations, and actual donations from men, relative to a non-intervention control group, controlling for patient race/ethnicity, gender, age, and household income. By identifying effective interventions for patient populations with historically lower rates of LDKT, we can eliminate many barriers to access, reduce disease burden, and lower mortality rates by producing more donor organs for transplantation. We are especially well-prepared to conduct the proposed research due to the multidisciplinary nature of the research team, as well as the expertise and experience of the team in developing LDKT and living donation educational materials, implementing and evaluating the House Calls intervention, conducting LDKT research with minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, and producing meaningful scientific and clinical outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Certain minorities and low-income patients are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease. While kidney transplantation offers the best option for long-term survival and reduced morbidity, minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged wait longer for kidney transplantation and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in minority and low-income patients. The proposed research is innovative because it further evaluates the relative effectiveness of one of the only empirically-supported interventions to reduce racial disparities in LDKT. Specifically, it will expand the reach of the intervention to include more minority groups, low-income patients, and a novel patient-centered decision support component. Findings from this study have the potential to close the health disparity gap by identifying effective educational and interventional strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT in minority and low-income patients.            ",House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation,8550042,R01DK098727,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Home Visits ', ' House Call ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Low Income Population ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' Living Donors ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' functional status ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Educational Materials ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Study Section ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2013,250865,0.1441238320891264
"Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities ae disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. The factors responsible for this disparity are complex and incompletely understood. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing number of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient- Oriented Research provides a unique mechanism to assist established investigators to attract and retain talented new physician-scientists to careers in patient-oriented research. The candidate for this K24 is James Lash, MD, an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Lash's research focuses on the epidemiology of CKD with a particular emphasis on minority populations. He has considerable experience as a patient- oriented researcher and is the Principal Investigator for two NIDDK-sponsored studies: 1) the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study and 2) the Hispanic CRIC Study. These studies, as well as several other multicenter collaborative studies, provide a wealth of opportunities for trainees. Dr. Lash has developed a solid track record for mentoring young investigators, including a significant number from minority backgrounds. The new research program funded by this award is a natural extension of Dr. Lash's ongoing work and will provide additional opportunities for trainees. It consists of two projects which focus on potential factors contributing to disparities in adults and children with CKD: 1) individual/neighborhood socioeconomic status, and 2) health literacy. This proposed research leverages the infrastructure of two large ongoing cohort studies (the CRIC Study and Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study) and therefore, provides a unique opportunity to examine these factors in both children and adults with CKD. In addition to mentored research, trainees will participate in didactic training through the UIC K30 Clinical Research Training Program and have access to the extensive resources and infrastructure provided by the UIC Center for Clinical Translational Science (CCTS), the UIC School of Public Health, and the UIC P60 Center for Excellence in Health Disparities. This K24 award will provide Dr. Lash with the additional time and resources to amplify his efforts in contributing to our understanding of health disparities in CKD and in training new physician scientists to become independent investigators in kidney disease research.          Chronic kidney disease afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing number of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The strengths of this K24 proposal entitled, ""Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program"" are as follows: the applicant's robust research program focusing on chronic kidney disease in minorities, his growing success in mentoring new clinician investigators, a comprehensive plan for mentoring and developing the careers of new physician scientists, the strong institutional support and resources at the University of Illinois, and an innovative researc proposal investigating the impact of socioeconomic status and health literacy in adults and children with chronic kidney disease.

"Myeloablative T- Replete Haploidentical PBSCT for Patients Without MRD or MUD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many patients, particularly those from ethnic minorities, are unable to access the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation due to the lack of a suitable donor. For such patients, umbilical cord blood can offer an alternative source of hematopoietic cells. However, adults typically require the concurrent use of two cord blood units (DCBT) at considerable expense. In adults such transplants are also associated with delayed immune reconstitution, increased rate of infections and a higher treatment related mortality than transplants from conventional donors. Recently the use of haploidentical (partially matched related donor) hematopoietic cell transplants (haplo-HCT) using T-cell-replete marrow grafts and post- transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have been shown to produce high rates of engraftment and low treatment related mortality (TRM) when used with a non-myeloablative preparative regimen, in patients who lack conventional donors. However, such transplants have limited efficacy in aggressive/advanced myeloid malignancies because of a high relapse rate. In an institutional pilot trial, we have assessed the use of T- replete mobilized peripheral blood (PBSC) and a myeloablative preparative regimen with haplo-HCT + PTCy. Despite the advanced and high-risk nature of the malignancies treated, estimated 6 month TRM was 14% and disease-free survival was 72%. All patients engrafted and developed full donor chimerism in CD3+ and CD33+ cells by day +30. A multi-institutional phase II trial is therefore proposed within the BMT CTN to confirm these encouraging results. The proposed trial will test the hypothesis that this novel approach to myeloablative haplo-HCT is safe and effective when used in a multi-institutional setting. Upon successful completion of this phase II trial, a randomized phase 111 comparison is proposed between this approach to haplo-HCT and myeloablative DCBT. The objective of this phase 111 study will be to directly compare these two approaches to alternative donor transplantation with respect to safety, toxicity, efficacy, cost and immune reconstitution. This trial would definitively determine the best option for myeloablative transplantation in patients with advanced malionancies who lack a matched-sibling or matched unrelated donor RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed research addresses a significant current deficiency in public health. Specifically, it tests a novel strategy that will enable curative myeloablative blood stem cell transplants in patients (particularly those from underserved minorities) who are currently unable to access them due to lack of a conventional donor. If successful, it will transform the standard-of-care by offering life-saving therapy to patients who would have died from their cancer and close a major disparity in healthcare access for ethnic minorities.

"Molecular Mechanism of APOL1 Associated Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop ESRD at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently we showed that coding sequence variants in the ApolipoproteinL1 (ApoL1) gene, present only in individuals with recent African ancestry, explain a very large proportion of this health disparity. This has now been confirmed by multiple additional studies. ApoL1 variants have a major impact on different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and HIV-associated nephropathy. Individuals with two variant ApoL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. 3.5 million African Americans likely have the high risk ApoL1 genotype. African Americans without two variant alleles have minimal excess risk. At present, little is known about the biology of ApoL1 or its rol in the kidney. ApoL1 has a defined role in resistance to trypanosomes, and the G1 and G2 variants appear to have become common in Africa because they confer protection against the forms of trypanosomes that cause African Sleeping Sickness. Here, our goal is to elucidate the function of ApoL1 and its role in causing human kidney disease in order to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this large disparity in kidney disease risk. ApoL1 is a Bcl2 family member with a BH3-only domain, suggesting a possible role in apoptosis. Our initial experiments in oocytes lead us to believe that this pathway may be an important mechanism of glomerular injury in ApoL1-associated disease. We propose to: 1. Define the cell biology and cell physiology of ApoL1: We will define the basic cellular biology of ApoL1 including biosynthesis, trafficking, ion channel properties, endocytosis, and effects on organellar structure and function. We will compare wild type and renal risk variant ApoL1 biology to understand the mechanisms that lead to kidney disease. 2. Examine specific effects of ApoL1 on apoptosis in podocytes: We hypothesize that ApoL1 risk variants promote podocyte apoptosis via a BH3 domain in the N- terminus and that the renal risk variants enhance ApoL1's pro-apoptotic effects. We will test this hypothesis both in cultured podocytes of different ApoL1 genotypes and by transfecting podocytes with ApoL1 constructs designed to probe the underlying apoptotic mechanisms. 3. Use a zebrafish model to study ApoL1- mediated renal injury in vivo: We will use zebrafish to understand how ApoL1 variants promote glomerular injury. We have demonstrated that the G1 risk variant increases embryonic lethality and causes glomerular pathology, and that wild type ApoL1 can reverse the pathologic phenotype caused by G1. We will examine the effects of heterologous ApoL1 expression in a whole organism using ubiquitous and tissue-specific promoters. We will define the risk variant domains that cause disease and the wild type domains that prevent G1-mediated injury. We will also define the specific interactions between the wild-type, G1, and G2 forms of ApoL1 in vivo. Lastly, we will examine the role of ApoL1 variants in promoting or preventing apoptosis of glomerular cells.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently found that specific genetic variants in a single gene, APOL1, account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We now want to understand precisely how these genetic variants lead to this major disparity in kidney disease at a biological level. This i of major importance in understanding the molecular mechanism of an enormous minority health disparity. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number people with this serious public health problem and ultimately removing a major racial health disparity.            ",Molecular Mechanism of APOL1 Associated Kidney Disease,8486603,R01MD007898,"['Trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Caring ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' American ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' podocyte ', ' BH3 Domain ', ' Recombinants ', ' in vivo ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' genetic variant ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' risk variant ', ' Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biology ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ions ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Oocytes ', ' Organelles ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Pathology ', ' Permeability ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2013,435000,0.042077644085832
"Health Literacy in Hispanics with Chronic Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 for Dr. Claudia Lora, who proposes the first systematic examination of health literacy in Hispanics with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This award will allow Dr. Lora the resources and protected time to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming a successful, independent patient-oriented researcher focusing on health care disparities in Hispanics with CKD. While Hispanics currently comprise 15% of the population, they are projected to comprise a quarter of the US population by 2050, Hispanics with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, a better understanding of the factors contributing to the progression of CKD in Hispanics is critical for reducing health disparities and developing therapeutic interventions. Health literacy is known to be associated with health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been well studied in the context of CKD. The potential for health literacy to affect patients' chronic disease management has been recognized by the Institute of Medicine, which in 2004, issued a call to action for research in health literac. Examining health literacy in Hispanics is of utmost importance because minorities and non-English speakers are more likely to have low functional health literacy than non-Hispanic whites. Low health literacy likely contributes to poor health outcomes in Hispanics with CKD through various mechanisms including disease knowledge, access to health care, and health behaviors. By understanding the relationship between health literacy and CKD, we may identify a therapeutic target in CKD progression. In view of the disproportionate burden of kidney disease in Hispanics, the proposed study will examine health literacy in a cohort of Hispanics with CKD. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) To examine health literacy as a predictor for progression of kidney disease in Hispanics with CKD; 2) To examine health literacy as a predictor for cardiovascular events and progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in Hispanics with CKD; and 3) To develop and field test a culturally sensitive, low-literacy, touch tablet application to improve knowledge of hypertension in Hispanics with CKD. The project contains novel concepts and strategies, and will result in the development of a new therapeutic intervention that could improve the health of Hispanics with CKD. The strengths of the proposal are the comprehensive career development plan, the experience and commitment of the mentoring team, and the strong institutional resources and support. In addition, the proposed research is innovative, addresses a growing public health problem, leverages the infrastructure of an ongoing NIH-funded cohort study, and will allow the applicant to gain the skills and experience needed to develop into an independent patient-oriented researcher.      Health literacy is known to influence health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been studied in Hispanics with predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). In view of the disproportionate burden of CKD in U.S. Hispanics, the mentored research has two overarching goals: 1) To examine health literacy as a predictor of CKD progression and cardiovascular outcomes in Hispanics with CKD and 2) To develop and pilot a low- literacy, touch tablet application to improve knowledge of hypertension in Hispanics with CKD, which will serve as the basis for a future R01 proposal. The proposed study will advance my research skills towards developing into an independent investigator and the knowledge gained has the potential to advance concepts that drive the field and thereby minimize health disparities in Hispanics with CKD.

"Effects of Age and Race on GFR Estimation in a Population-based Cohort This protocol will evaluate the utility of the two GFR markers, creatinine and cystatin C, in comparison with measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by iohexol clearance in 375 Black and White adult participants of the population-based Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort from the Johns Hopkins clinical center. Although GFR estimation by creatinine has improved over the past decade, there has been inadequate inclusion of persons over 65 years of age, and no study of GFR measurement has occurred within a population-based sample of Blacks and Whites in the United States. To advance the detection and definition of CKD across a broad age range of diverse adults,, we must focus on the higher ranges of GFR, and we must identify the optimal strategy for GFR estimation. The first Aim of this cross-sectional study will be to determine the influence of Black race-ethnicity on serum levels of filtration markers (creatinine and cystatin C) in the general population, and to modify current GFR equations to capture optimally the influence of Black race. The second Aim will be: to evaluate age-related decline in GFR; to compare the relative ability of the filtration markers to capture declining GFR with age; and, to modify current GFR equations to incorporate the influence of age. In executing these Aims, we will determine the optimal biomarker(s) for GFR estimation ¿ creatinine, cystatin C, or both. In addition, blood specimens will be stored with the potential for examination of future filtration markers. To accomplish our objectives, we will measure iohexol-GFR in approximately 375 Black and White MESA participants, spanning a target age range of 55-95. This study could be a major contributor to the National Institute of Health¿s efforts to address the persistent racial disparities in the burden of kidney disease in the United States. Chronic kidney disease is a public health problem that disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the US. The normal levels of kidney function and the accuracy of equations to estimate kidney function are not known in racial and ethnic minorities, which represent barriers to effective clinical practice, research and public health efforts for CKD in these groups.

"Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney to benefit a loved one or even a stranger, but the long-term consequences of donating a kidney, particularly in African Americans, are poorly understood. In this study, we will study high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and post-donation treatment patterns in largest ever primary cohort of African American donors, Caucasian American donors, matched healthy non-donor controls (who were cleared for donation but did not ultimately donate because of recipient factors), and other matched healthy individuals (who participated in large cohort studies and were deemed healthy enough to have likely passed a donor evaluation). Our findings will influence the practice of live kidney donation in the United States, particularly among African Americans, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care.            ",Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans,8506499,R01DK096008,"['Anemia ', ' bone disorder ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Hypertensive Nephropathy ', ' Renal Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medical Records ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Minerals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' Living Donors ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' Agreement ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' data registry ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,710233,0.17693976748080628
"Understanding Race and Culture in Living Donor Kidney Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive kidney transplants, the optimal treatment for ESRD. Race disparities exist in the (a) overall rate of transplantation; (b) type of transplant received [i.e., deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) versus living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT)]; and, (c) early post-transplant health outcomes. One of the best ways to reduce racial disparities in transplantation may be to increase the rate of LDKT among AAs. Although it is known that LDKT is the optimal treatment for ESRD, and that AAs receive LDKTs at much lower rates than whites, the reasons for this disparity among patients already referred for transplant are poorly understood. Further, even among the group of patients who receive LDKT, race disparities in early post- transplant health outcomes persist. Known biological differences associated with race (e.g., presensitization or heightened immune response, donor co-morbid health conditions) do not fully explain the observed racial disparities. Thus, the central goals of this prospective cohort study are to understand (a) the culturally-related and psychosocial factors associated with race disparities in LDKT, and (b) the relationship of those factors with early post-transplant health outcomes in a sample of AA and white transplant candidates. The proposed project will take an interdisciplinary approach in developing a bio-psychosocial model to understand race disparities in LDKT. It will control for demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, SES), and physical health factors (e.g., physical health, co-morbidities, post-transplant adherence) in order to understand the role of culturally-related factors (e.g., medical mistrust, perceived racism and discrimination, religious beliefs, family networks), transplant related beliefs (e.g., knowledge, decision-making factors, transplant attitudes) and psychosocial factors (e.g., depression/anxiety, social support, coping strategies) on race disparities in LDKT. This prospective cohort study will assess patients (n=1775) at two critical time points leading to transplantation (pre-transplant work-up and completion of transplant evaluation), and at 6 months post-transplant. Predictor variables will be assessed via telephone interview at pre-transplant work-up. Whether or not patients completed transplant evaluation will be assessed at the second time-point through medical record abstraction, and patients' perspective of the quantity and quality of interactions with transplant staff will be assessed with a follow-up interview after transplant evaluation is completed. Finally, type of transplant received as well as early post-transplant health outcomes will be assessed using a final follow-up telephone interview, and additional medical record abstraction. Findings from this study are an essential step toward the long-term goal of developing patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post- transplant health outcomes among African Americans.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are four times as likely as whites to have end stage renal disease (ESRD), but only half as likely to receive a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESRD. Because known biological differences do not fully explain the observed racial disparities, this project will examine how culturally-related factors are associated with barriers and facilitators to LDKT and subsequent early post-transplant health outcomes. Findings from this study are needed in order to develop patient, provider, and system-level interventions to increase rates of LDKT and improve post-transplant health outcomes among African Americans.

"Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. organ donation system is in a perpetual state of crisis. Over 115,000 patients are waiting for transplants while the waitlist increases by several thousand annually despite over 6,500 dying and 3,500 becoming too sick to receive a transplant. Black men are disproportionally affected by this crisis, due to higher prevalence of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes and inadequate access to treatment, leading to the highest prevalence of end-stage renal disease and a greater need for kidney transplantation. While Blacks comprise only 13 percent of the total U.S. population, they comprise 34 percent of the 93,000 patients waiting for kidney transplants. Black men comprise 19 percent of the waitlist compared to black women comprising 15 percent, indicating a gender disparity as well. Federally supported interventions have increased the number of black donors such that rates are now proportional to their population percentages, but they remain well below the disproportionate need since organs best match when donors and recipients are of similar race. In this application, we will investigate means for improving organ donor registration among black men using educational video programming produced and distributed in partnership with our network of black owned barbershops in NYC. We will use entertainment education videos and determine how content produced for different audiences (generic multicultural, targeted for black men in our barbershops, and tailored for single viewers based on their prior organ donation beliefs) influences organ donor registration. Our application is a 3- phase qualitative and quantitative research design that includes an intervention development phase using digital video interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos (Aim 1); a 3 arm randomized controlled trial phase, in which customers will be randomized to receive the generic, targeted, or tailored video programming delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mailed in application (Aim 2); and a failure analysis whereby we will interview some of the participants from the randomized trial who registered and failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain the influence of the programming (Aim 3). Future studies will involve modifying this video programming based on findings from this research to promote organ donation in black owned barbershops through passive messaging with generic or targeted videos shown on large screen TVs, or with tailored programs using interactive kiosks. Through this work, we hope to reduce organ transplantation disparities through increased registration among black men who comprise a group having a disproportionally greater need for kidney transplants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will lead to increased organ donor registration among black men who visit black owned barbershops and improve understanding as to what video education strategies are best for encouraging organ donor registration in this setting. We have previously shown with our cardiovascular health promotion and cancer prevention research that, as a stage for influential peers, black owned barbershops constitute an existing and unique community setting and peer network that can be utilized to promote healthy behavior for black men. This research meets specific goals of Healthy People 2020 including, ""Decreasing disparities and measuring access to care for diverse populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and older adults"" and its agenda advocating use of targeted and tailored interventions for improving health among disadvantaged communities.            ",Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men,8561373,R01DK099639,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mails ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Visitors to Patients ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Specialist ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Organ Donations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' motivational intervention ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,368663,0.100978125428191
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Kidney Function Decline: Genes or Environment? Project Summary: This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carmen A. Peralta, who proposes a novel, multi-disciplinary approach to understanding racial/ethcnic disparities in kidney function decline. This award will allow Dr. Peralta the resources and protected time to achieve the following career development goals: (1) to become an independent, translational clinical researcher in the field of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease; (2) to become an expert in the application of genetic epidemiology methods to study these differences; and (3) to utilize sociodemographic measurements to improve understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in these disparities. To achieve these goals, Dr. Peralta has assembled a mentoring team comprised of her sponsor and primary mentor, Dr. Michael Shlipak (an expert in the field of cardiovascular complications of early kidney dysfunction), and two co-mentors: Dr. Neil Risch (a genetic epidemiologist) and Dr. Paula Braveman (an expert in social determinants of health).  The epidemic of kidney disease currently affects 13% of U.S. adults, and the progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) affects minorities disparately. African-Americans and Hispanics are the fastest grow- ing groups in the ESRD population. Despite well-documented disparities in progression of advanced kidney disease to ESRD, no studies have evaluated the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or early kidney function decline in the US across racial/ethnic groups. It is unknown whether certain racial/ethnic groups have an increased genetic predisposition due to a common genetic ancestry or whether social or environ- mental factors explain observed differences. Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), Dr. Peralta will compare rates of kidney function decline and incident CKD across four major racial groups and test possible genetic and sociodemographic mechanisms to explain these differences. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To compare rates of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease across four major racial/ethnic groups (Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese- Americans) using creatinine and cystatin C based measures; Aim 2: To evaluate whether genetic ancestry is an independent predictor of kidney function decline and incident chronic kidney disease within racial groups and to explore gene-environment interactions in kidney function decline and incident kidney; and Aim 3: To evaluate the association of individual and neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics with kidney function decline and incident kidney disease across racial groups. Relevance: A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in racial/ethnic disparities in kidney function decline at earlier stages of kidney dysfunction could lead to important interventions and prevention strategies in halting this costly epidemic. .

"Improving Primary Care to Narrow Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem affecting over 30 million US adults, who are at increased risk for hospitalization, cardiovascular disease, progression to end-stage renal disease, and death. African Americans are disproportionately affected by CKD, experiencing a four-fold greater incidence of end-stage renal disease than Whites. Receipt of high-quality primary care for patients with CKD creates opportunities for patients to identify and treat their risks for CKD progression and represents a key strategy for both improving patients' clinical outcomes overall and for addressing racial disparities in CKD progression. Evidence suggests that, overall, the primary care of patients with CKD (including patients' appropriate utilization of primary care services, primary care providers' appropriate management of CKD, and high-quality patient-physician discussions about CKD) is lacking. Studies identifying the contribution of suboptimal primary care to racial disparities in CKD outcomes have not previously been performed. Further, mechanisms through which interventions to improve primary care might narrow disparities are unknown. The overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) conduct a retrospective cohort study to quantify differences in the utilization of primary care services and the quality of CKD care among African American and Whites with CKD and explore the contribution of these differences to racial disparities in CKD outcomes, 2) conduct a cross- sectional study to identify key system-, provider-, and patient-level factors contributing to racial disparities in utilization and quality of CKD care in primary care settings, and 3) conduct a prospective cohort study of African Americans with CKD, to assess the quality of patients' interactions with their primary care providers about CKD, and to explore the association of high-quality interactions with patients' improved understanding and self-management of their risks for CKD progression.  The candidate for this mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Raquel Greer, is a General Internist and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and her long-term career goal is to establish her independence as a patient-oriented researcher addressing mechanisms leading to ethnic/racial disparities in CKD. During the award, Dr. Greer will undergo a rigorous didactic and research program, including an advanced, intensive set of didactic courses, seminars, and practical research experience that will substantially build her skills in developing and studying interventions to address ethnic/racial disparities in the care of patients with CKD. These career development activities will be conducted within the rich training environment of Johns Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research with direct guidance from outstanding mentors and advisors with expertise in studying the health care and clinical outcomes of patients with CKD, health disparities research, and other related research methods. These activities will provide Dr. Greer with a solid foundation for her successful transition toward gaining independent funding as a clinician investigator skilled in performing studies to address ethnic/racial disparities in te clinical care and outcomes of patients with CKD.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ethnic/racial minorities are more frequently affected by chronic kidney disease than non-minorities, and they experience worse clinical outcomes than non-minorities. Providing patients with high-quality primary care is a key strategy for improving their health outcomes overall and for addressing race differences in health outcomes. This application will fund studies to understand ways in which primary care providers can improve the health of minority and non-minority patients with chronic kidney disease.        ",Improving Primary Care to Narrow Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease,8544469,K23DK094975,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Creatinine ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Lipids ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Internist ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Prevention Research ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' minority health ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' Medicare claim ', ' primary care setting ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,177451,0.1309788856417086
"Molecular Mechanism of APOL1 Associated Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop ESRD at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently we showed that coding sequence variants in the ApolipoproteinL1 (ApoL1) gene, present only in individuals with recent African ancestry, explain a very large proportion of this health disparity. This has now been confirmed by multiple additional studies. ApoL1 variants have a major impact on different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and HIV-associated nephropathy. Individuals with two variant ApoL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. 3.5 million African Americans likely have the high risk ApoL1 genotype. African Americans without two variant alleles have minimal excess risk. At present, little is known about the biology of ApoL1 or its rol in the kidney. ApoL1 has a defined role in resistance to trypanosomes, and the G1 and G2 variants appear to have become common in Africa because they confer protection against the forms of trypanosomes that cause African Sleeping Sickness. Here, our goal is to elucidate the function of ApoL1 and its role in causing human kidney disease in order to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this large disparity in kidney disease risk. ApoL1 is a Bcl2 family member with a BH3-only domain, suggesting a possible role in apoptosis. Our initial experiments in oocytes lead us to believe that this pathway may be an important mechanism of glomerular injury in ApoL1-associated disease. We propose to: 1. Define the cell biology and cell physiology of ApoL1: We will define the basic cellular biology of ApoL1 including biosynthesis, trafficking, ion channel properties, endocytosis, and effects on organellar structure and function. We will compare wild type and renal risk variant ApoL1 biology to understand the mechanisms that lead to kidney disease. 2. Examine specific effects of ApoL1 on apoptosis in podocytes: We hypothesize that ApoL1 risk variants promote podocyte apoptosis via a BH3 domain in the N- terminus and that the renal risk variants enhance ApoL1's pro-apoptotic effects. We will test this hypothesis both in cultured podocytes of different ApoL1 genotypes and by transfecting podocytes with ApoL1 constructs designed to probe the underlying apoptotic mechanisms. 3. Use a zebrafish model to study ApoL1- mediated renal injury in vivo: We will use zebrafish to understand how ApoL1 variants promote glomerular injury. We have demonstrated that the G1 risk variant increases embryonic lethality and causes glomerular pathology, and that wild type ApoL1 can reverse the pathologic phenotype caused by G1. We will examine the effects of heterologous ApoL1 expression in a whole organism using ubiquitous and tissue-specific promoters. We will define the risk variant domains that cause disease and the wild type domains that prevent G1-mediated injury. We will also define the specific interactions between the wild-type, G1, and G2 forms of ApoL1 in vivo. Lastly, we will examine the role of ApoL1 variants in promoting or preventing apoptosis of glomerular cells.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently found that specific genetic variants in a single gene, APOL1, account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We now want to understand precisely how these genetic variants lead to this major disparity in kidney disease at a biological level. This i of major importance in understanding the molecular mechanism of an enormous minority health disparity. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number people with this serious public health problem and ultimately removing a major racial health disparity.            ",Molecular Mechanism of APOL1 Associated Kidney Disease,8695481,R01MD007898,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biology ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ions ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Oocytes ', ' Organelles ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Pathology ', ' Permeability ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Caring ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' American ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' podocyte ', ' BH3 Domain ', ' Recombinants ', ' in vivo ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' risk variant ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,435000,0.042077644085832
"Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mid-Career Investigator Award in ""Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD"" by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Associate Professor-in-Residence of Medicine, Pediatrics and Epidemiology at UCLA Schools of Medicine & Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several UCLA related campuses including Harbor-UCLA and Charles-Drew University. These centers provide care to underserved and indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis to survive. African Americans and Hispanics are vastly overrepresented by 3.6 and 1.5 times greater than non-Hispanic Whites, respectively, among US dialysis patients. Whereas the 5-year survival of dialysis patients is <35%, with the highest mortality among malnourished patients, minorities exhibit lower dialysis mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival disparities and their link to nutritional status and dietary barriers can have major clinical and public health implications. PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race; whereas 2 alternative hypotheses related to bone-and-mineral disorders and psychosocial and coping status will also be examined. PI proposes a 5-year patient-oriented, prospective study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,050 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African Americans & 1/3 Hispanics), in collaboration with Southern California DaVita dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status & quality of life will be assessed longitudinally. Clinical events and survival will be followed, and specimens for ongoing and future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed at GCRC. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be develop- ed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 100,000 HD patients. This K24 award with proposed cohort study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue and expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator of training of new investigators in the fields of CKD nutrition & disparities by continuing his liaison with faculty across several campuses, schools and departments within UCLA system including Depts. of Medicine and Pediatrics, Charles-Drew Univ., and UCLA Public Health. (2) Continue and expand his credible efforts in increasing the availability of research participation to minority populations with CKD in Southern California; and (3) Continue to develop a relatively new area of CKD disparity and nutrition research specifically through continued support of the DaVita Clinical Research both in Southern California and across the nation by examining the cohort of Southern dialysis patients and national dialysis cohorts. The data collected and hypotheses generated throughout this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to power additional clinical studies by early career investigators and mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve on patient care.        Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their relationship to nutritional status, diet and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to developing more effective strategies to improve outcomes in dialysis population, other 20 million Americans with CKD, and another 30 to 40 million people who suffer from chronic disease states and wasting disorders including chronic heart failure, chronic lung or liver diseases, terminal malignancy, AIDS, advanced age, and other conditions with cachexia. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important plans.

"Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney to benefit a loved one or even a stranger, but the long-term consequences of donating a kidney, particularly in African Americans, are poorly understood. In this study, we will study high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and post-donation treatment patterns in largest ever primary cohort of African American donors, Caucasian American donors, matched healthy non-donor controls (who were cleared for donation but did not ultimately donate because of recipient factors), and other matched healthy individuals (who participated in large cohort studies and were deemed healthy enough to have likely passed a donor evaluation).

"TAILORED COMPUTER EDUCATION TO INCREASE LIVING DONATION IN AFRICAN-AMERICANS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney transplantation offers patients in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 3 to 17 additional years of life and improved quality-of-life compared to remaining on dialysis. Because of the deceased donor organ shortage, more kidney patients are choosing to receive kidneys from family and friends, a process called living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Although African-Americans are 3.7 times more likely to develop ESRD, they are less likely to receive LDKTs. Therefore, this project will assess whether racial disparities in transplant knowledge, readiness to pursue LDKT, completion of transplant medical evaluation, and receipt of LDKTs can be reduced when ESRD patients receive access to personalized coaching and individually-tailored feedback using an Explore Transplant computerized Expert System. This multilevel study will also examine how other known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT impact the Expert System's effectiveness. ESRD patients presenting for transplant medical evaluation at Barnes-Jewish Transplant Center in St. Louis, Missouri (465 African-Americans, 465 Whites) will be stratified by race and randomized to one of two education conditions (Explore Transplant Expert System vs. Standard Education Control). As they complete transplant medical evaluation, patients in the Expert System condition will receive individually tailored feedback reports and personalized coaching addressing variables important to behavior change and associated with LDKT health disparities. Control patients will only receive standard-of-care education provided by the transplant center. Changes in key outcomes will be assessed at four time points (2-months before in-hospital evaluation day (IHED) (baseline), 2- and 6-months post-IHED, and 18-months post-baseline). The grant has four aims:  Aim 1 (Primary): Compared to the Control Group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System increase in their LDKT readiness and transplant knowledge 6-months post-IHED.  Aim 2: Compared to the Control group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System are more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT 18- months post-baseline.  Aim 3: To examine whether the Expert System's effectiveness in changing LDKT decision-making and behavior is equivalent between African-Americans and Whites.  Aim 4: To examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with the Expert System to affect African-Americans' decision-making and behavior.  At the conclusion of the study, we will have developed an innovative and cost-effective Explore Transplant Expert System that could be utilized by providers in 5,000 dialysis and 250 transplant centers to tailor LDKT discussion and education based on the needs of individual patients of different races.        Patients with kidney failure have better health and quality-of-life when they receive a transplant, especially a transplant from a living donor (LDKT). Although kidney failure disproportionately affects African-Americans, Whites are more likely to receive LDKTs. This randomized controlled trial of 930 African-American and White patients will develop and assess the effectiveness of individually tailored, computer-generated education using an Expert System for overcoming specific barriers affecting African-Americans' pursuit of LDKT.

"Kidney disease mechanisms associated with human genetic variation  Chronic kidney disease (CKD), like many complex disease phenotypes, reflects dependent interactions between genetic susceptibilities and environmental factors. APOL1 variants explain much of the excess risk of advanced non-diabetic CKD in patients of African ancestry. However, only some patients with risk genotypes develop kidney disease, suggesting that genetic epistasis or environmental stress is required to trigger variant APOL1-dependent kidney injury. To investigate how APOL1 variants result in CKD, we have focused on HIV- associated nephropathy (HIVAN), the disease most robustly associated with APOL1 risk haplotypes and clearly dependent on an environmental factor, HIV-1 infection. Our preliminary data demonstrate APOL1 is expressed in the podocyte, and APOL1 overexpression activates autophagy. Although mTor-dependent suppression of core autophagy may cause diabetic glomerulopathy, a renal pathology not associated with APOL1 variants, we provide evidence that the genetic association of APOL1 with CKD results from APOL1- dependent regulation of distinct, selective autophagy pathways, which result in the destruction of pathogens. We hypothesize that APOL1 is an autophagic adaptor that tethers a docking SNARE (VAMP8) displayed on lysosomes to the autophagosomal protein LC3-II. The tethering function of APOL1 is activated by binding a triggering molecule, the HIV protein Nef, and results in the selective degradation of autophagosomes carrying HIV viral particles and proteins. Variant APOL1 proteins are functionally defective, permitting HIV to persist in the infected cell and continue synthesis of viral proteins including Nef. Nef blocks autophagic elimination of the virus and is critical for development of HIVAN. Our proposed experiments address three unanswered and novel questions regarding APOL1 function in CKD. Is APOL1 synthesized in situ in kidney and what is its subcellular home? Does circulating or renal-expressed variant APOL1 mediate kidney disease? Does dysregulation of autophagy pathways activated in response to specific environmental stresses result in kidney disease in patients with APOL1 risk genotypes? These questions are addressed with the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine APOL1 expression and intracellular location in normal kidney, and determine if APOL1 localization varies with risk genotype and/or disease diagnosis; 2. Generate in vivo models for the study of APOL1 function; 3. Characterize protein interactions between APOL1 with VAMP8 and the HIV protein Nef and examine normal and variant APOL1 regulation of autophagy in cell lines and cultured podocytes. These studies can result in novel, mechanism-based therapies, improve health disparities in African American patients and identify novel mechanisms of human CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 26 million Americans have evidence for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and more than 570,000 patients have kidney failure (end-stage renal disease [ESRD]). Health care for ESRD patients, who comprise less than 1% of Medicare recipients, accounts for 7% of Medicare expenditures, approximately $30 billion. ESRD patients are at risk for accelerated cardiovascular disease and early death. African American CKD patients in the United States are four times more likely than white patients to progress to ESRD, and a single genetic susceptibility locus (APOL1) explains much of this increased risk. This project's goal is to define biological reasons for the association of APOL1 with CKD in patients with African ancestry in order to improve health disparities in this high-risk population.

"Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. organ donation system is in a perpetual state of crisis. Over 115,000 patients are waiting for transplants while the waitlist increases by several thousand annually despite over 6,500 dying and 3,500 becoming too sick to receive a transplant. Black men are disproportionally affected by this crisis, due to higher prevalence of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes and inadequate access to treatment, leading to the highest prevalence of end-stage renal disease and a greater need for kidney transplantation. While Blacks comprise only 13 percent of the total U.S. population, they comprise 34 percent of the 93,000 patients waiting for kidney transplants. Black men comprise 19 percent of the waitlist compared to black women comprising 15 percent, indicating a gender disparity as well. Federally supported interventions have increased the number of black donors such that rates are now proportional to their population percentages, but they remain well below the disproportionate need since organs best match when donors and recipients are of similar race. In this application, we will investigate means for improving organ donor registration among black men using educational video programming produced and distributed in partnership with our network of black owned barbershops in NYC. We will use entertainment education videos and determine how content produced for different audiences (generic multicultural, targeted for black men in our barbershops, and tailored for single viewers based on their prior organ donation beliefs) influences organ donor registration. Our application is a 3- phase qualitative and quantitative research design that includes an intervention development phase using digital video interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos (Aim 1); a 3 arm randomized controlled trial phase, in which customers will be randomized to receive the generic, targeted, or tailored video programming delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mailed in application (Aim 2); and a failure analysis whereby we will interview some of the participants from the randomized trial who registered and failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain the influence of the programming (Aim 3). Future studies will involve modifying this video programming based on findings from this research to promote organ donation in black owned barbershops through passive messaging with generic or targeted videos shown on large screen TVs, or with tailored programs using interactive kiosks. Through this work, we hope to reduce organ transplantation disparities through increased registration among black men who comprise a group having a disproportionally greater need for kidney transplants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will lead to increased organ donor registration among black men who visit black owned barbershops and improve understanding as to what video education strategies are best for encouraging organ donor registration in this setting. We have previously shown with our cardiovascular health promotion and cancer prevention research that, as a stage for influential peers, black owned barbershops constitute an existing and unique community setting and peer network that can be utilized to promote healthy behavior for black men. This research meets specific goals of Healthy People 2020 including, ""Decreasing disparities and measuring access to care for diverse populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and older adults"" and its agenda advocating use of targeted and tailored interventions for improving health among disadvantaged communities.            ",Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men,8699192,R01DK099639,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mails ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Visitors to Patients ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Specialist ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Organ Donations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' motivational intervention ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2014,368663,0.100978125428191
"Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities ae disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. The factors responsible for this disparity are complex and incompletely understood. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing number of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient- Oriented Research provides a unique mechanism to assist established investigators to attract and retain talented new physician-scientists to careers in patient-oriented research. The candidate for this K24 is James Lash, MD, an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Lash's research focuses on the epidemiology of CKD with a particular emphasis on minority populations. He has considerable experience as a patient- oriented researcher and is the Principal Investigator for two NIDDK-sponsored studies: 1) the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study and 2) the Hispanic CRIC Study. These studies, as well as several other multicenter collaborative studies, provide a wealth of opportunities for trainees. Dr. Lash has developed a solid track record for mentoring young investigators, including a significant number from minority backgrounds. The new research program funded by this award is a natural extension of Dr. Lash's ongoing work and will provide additional opportunities for trainees. It consists of two projects which focus on potential factors contributing to disparities in adults and children with CKD: 1) individual/neighborhood socioeconomic status, and 2) health literacy. This proposed research leverages the infrastructure of two large ongoing cohort studies (the CRIC Study and Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study) and therefore, provides a unique opportunity to examine these factors in both children and adults with CKD. In addition to mentored research, trainees will participate in didactic training through the UIC K30 Clinical Research Training Program and have access to the extensive resources and infrastructure provided by the UIC Center for Clinical Translational Science (CCTS), the UIC School of Public Health, and the UIC P60 Center for Excellence in Health Disparities. This K24 award will provide Dr. Lash with the additional time and resources to amplify his efforts in contributing to our understanding of health disparities in CKD and in training new physician scientists to become independent investigators in kidney disease research.          Chronic kidney disease afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing number of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology.

"Gender Disparities and Vascular Function in Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is Ana C. Ricardo, MD, MPH, a nephrologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Ricardo's short-term goals are to gain experience and develop skills by conducting research focused on gender disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the contribution of gender differences in endothelial function to these disparities. Her long-term career goals are to become an independent investigator conducting research focused on reducing health inequalities in CKD through lifestyle interventions. To achieve her goals, Dr. Ricardo has assembled a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentored research and didactic coursework at the UIC School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's strong team of mentors and collaborators includes world-class experts with longstanding NIH funding and extensive mentorship experience. Her primary mentor, James P. Lash, MD, is an expert in the epidemiology of CKD in minority populations; Martha L. Daviglus, MD, PhD, her co-mentor, has expertise in the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. The proposal also includes a multidisciplinary team of collaborators with expertise in the areas of women's health, longitudinal data analyses, and the influence of exercise on vascular function. Dr. Ricardo's successful development into an independent physician-scientist will be facilitated by the extensive facilities and resources available at UIC which include the Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Center for Research on Women and Gender, and the School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's research will advance her skills in both primary data collection and longitudinal data analyses. The proposal leverages the infrastructure of the NIH- funded Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, a large and diverse observational study of adults with CKD. Evidence suggests that there are significant gender-related disparities in CKD. Whereas data from the United States Renal Data System indicate that men have 1.5 times greater incidence of end-stage renal disease, a higher prevalence of CKD in women was seen in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Several studies suggest that men have more rapid CKD progression, but this has not been a consistent finding. Furthermore, previous studies were not designed to address this question and included few racial/ethnic minorities. In the general population, there is evidence that differential rates of cardiovascular outcomes in women and men may be related to gender differences in endothelial function, which have been in part attributed to the protective effect of estrogen in women. Moreover, limited data suggest that endothelial dysfunction may be a predictor of CKD progression. However, the contribution of endothelial function to gender disparities in CKD progression is not known. This is an area of significance because studies of non-CKD populations suggest that endothelial function may be improved with pharmacologic therapy (e.g., ACE- inhibitors) or lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise). The specific aims for the proposed project are to 1) Examine gender disparities in kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in the CRIC Study; 2) Examine gender differences in endothelial function and the role of endothelial function as a predictor of CKD progression in 150 University of Illinois CRIC Study participants; and 3) Evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week pilot resistance exercise training intervention and its effect on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This Career Development Award will provide the foundation for Dr. Ricardo to pursue an independent research career dedicated to reducing health disparities in CKD.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem in the U.S. and evidence suggests that outcomes are different for men and women with CKD. The aims of this proposal are to 1) Identify modifiable factors responsible for gender disparities in CKD outcomes; 2) Evaluate the impact of vascular function on gender disparities in CKD progression; and 3) Conduct a pilot study evaluating the effect of resistance exercise on vascular function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This research will fill important gaps in our knowledge and potentially lead to the development of targeted interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with CKD.        ",Gender Disparities and

"APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease  SUMMARY More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop kidney failure at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently, we discovered two coding sequence variants in ApolipoproteinL1 (APOL1) that account for a large proportion of this major health disparity. APOL1 kidney disease variants have a major impact on multiple different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Risk inheritance is recessive: individuals with two variant APOL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. We predict that more than 3.5 million African Americans have the high risk APOL1 genotype. The presence of two risk alleles does not lead to kidney disease in all individuals, indicating that other genetic and environmental factors are important modifiers. Understanding why some individuals with the high-risk genotype develop kidney disease while others do not will improve risk stratification and may illuminate the pathways most amenable to therapy. We therefore propose to: Aim 1: Identify additional genetic modifiers at the APOL1 gene locus. Our data suggest that APOL1 kidney disease risk variants are gain-of- function alleles. Since not all individuals with two risk alleles develop disease, other local polymorphisms may regulate expression of APOL1, modulating the effect of the disease-causing APOL1 coding mutations. We will define structural variants that may alter APOL1 gene expression, and test their effects on the penetrance of the two disease-causing alleles. We will test whether polymorphisms in transcription factor and microRNA binding sites affect the penetrance of these APOL1 risk alleles. Aim 2: Find epistatic modifiers of APOL1 penetrance. The APOL1 renal risk variants increased in frequency in Africa, at least in part, because they provided protection against trypanosomes. We hypothesize that additional genetic loci were simultaneously selected that protect against renal injury from the major coding risk alleles, and that the protective effect of these loci may have diminished after admixture with Europeans. Here, we will perform a genome-wide screen for polymorphisms that may protect against or exacerbate APOL1 variant-induced renal injury. We will identify proteins that bind differentially to wild type and coding variant ApoL1, as these binding partners may modulate injury caused by the risk variants. Aim 3: Identify biochemical modifiers of APOL1-mediated renal disease. ApoL1 kidney disease risk variants may be most deleterious in the setting of additional risk factors. Here, we explore how two important factors may interact with APOL1 genotype to cause renal disease. Vitamin D is believed to be protective against renal injury, while certain lipid profiles may promote injury. We ask whether these molecules alter APOL1 biology in vitro, and whether biochemical levels of these mediators predict which individuals with the APOL1 risk genotype are likely to develop kidney disease.  8. Project Narrative We have recently found that specific genetic variants in the APOL1 gene account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We now want to understand the factors that combine with the high risk APOL1 genotype to cause overt kidney disease. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number of people with this serious public health problem and for reducing the very large disparity in the rates of kidney disease.",APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease,8607479,R01MD007092,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Gene Expression ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' In Vitro ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' United States ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Yeasts ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Renal glomerular syndrome ', ' Renal glomerular disorder ', ' Renal glomerular disease or syndrome ', ' Renal Glomerular Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Glomerular disease ', ' Renal glomerular disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Penetrance ', ' American ', ' Yeast One/Two-Hybrid System ', ' Yeast One Hybrid System ', ' Two Hybrid ', ' yeast two hybrid system ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Other Genetics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' protective effect ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' gain of function ', ' high risk ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' risk variant ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,435000,0.05601613153438291
"House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While kidney transplantation is the best treatment option for adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), profound racial and socioeconomic disparities persist. Minorities and low-income patients, for instance, are less likely to receive lve donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), which yields better survival, quality of life, and health care cost outcomes than chronic dialysis or deceased donor transplantation. Guided by a socio- ecological model of LDKT, the PI developed an innovative House Calls intervention that has shown to be effective at overcoming barriers and increasing LDKT rates in Black patients. We now seek to expand the reach and intensity of the House Calls intervention by including other minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and by adding a novel Patient-Centered Decision Support component. Also, little is known about those variables that mediate the intervention's impact on the occurrence of LDKT or whether the intervention can attenuate the growing gender disparity in living donation. In this study, we will pursue three specific aims: (1) evaluate the differential benefit of adding a patient-centered decision support component to the House Calls intervention; (2) identify mediators of the relationship between the interventions and the occurrence of LDKT; and (3) examine whether the House Calls intervention reduces the gender disparity in rates of living kidney donation. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a single-site, randomized controlled trial with a planned enrollment of 100 minority and low income patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Patients will be randomized to receive the House Calls intervention alone (HC) or the House Calls intervention + a web-based Patient-Centered Decision Support intervention (HC+DS). The central hypothesis is that, compared to HC alone, the HC+DS group will have a higher proportion of enrolled patients with LDKT by the 2-yr study endpoint (primary outcome) and higher proportions of enrolled patients with at least one live donor inquiry, at least one live donor evaluation, and in LDKT action (vs. contemplation) stages (secondary outcomes). Also, we will evaluate whether the House Calls intervention (either HC alone or HC+DS) leads to more donor inquiries, evaluations, and actual donations from men, relative to a non-intervention control group, controlling for patient race/ethnicity, gender, age, and household income. By identifying effective interventions for patient populations with historically lower rates of LDKT, we can eliminate many barriers to access, reduce disease burden, and lower mortality rates by producing more donor organs for transplantation. We are especially well-prepared to conduct the proposed research due to the multidisciplinary nature of the research team, as well as the expertise and experience of the team in developing LDKT and living donation educational materials, implementing and evaluating the House Calls intervention, conducting LDKT research with minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, and producing meaningful scientific and clinical outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Certain minorities and low-income patients are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease. While kidney transplantation offers the best option for long-term survival and reduced morbidity, minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged wait longer for kidney transplantation and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in minority and low-income patients. The proposed research is innovative because it further evaluates the relative effectiveness of one of the only empirically-supported interventions to reduce racial disparities in LDKT. Specifically, it will expand the reach of the intervention to include more minority groups, low-income patients, and a novel patient-centered decision support component. Findings from this study have the potential to close the health disparity gap by identifying effective educational and interventional strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT in minority and low-income patients.",House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation,8724959,R01DK098727,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Home Visits ', ' House Call ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Low Income Population ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' Living Donors ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' functional status ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Educational Materials ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Study Section ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,261000,0.1441238320891264
"Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for kidney failure is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which provides an average of 10 additional years of life compared to staying on chronic dialysis. Unfortunately, large racial/ethnic disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics comprise over 58 percent of all dialysis patients but receive less than 28 percent of LDKTs. A little-studied and likely crucial cause of LDKT disparities is the lower likelihood that Black and Hispanic donor volunteers (persons interested in donating a live kidney) will complete the multi-step donor evaluation and actually donate. While minority donor volunteers are more likely to have medical contraindications to donation, they are also much more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation or decline participation in paired exchange (programs that permit LDKT using immunologically incompatible donor-recipient pairs). Based upon limited prior research, the outcomes of the donor evaluation may be especially affected by several potentially modifiable individual and health care system factors, such as donor volunteers' motivation to donate, health literacy, knowledge/education about donation, satisfaction with the patient care experience, and socioeconomic barriers to donation. These factors, however, have not been prospectively examined in a well-powered, multi-center, and diverse cohort of donor volunteers. The objective of this study is to determine how differences in modifiable individual and system factors are associated with Black and Hispanic donor volunteers' lower likelihood of actually donating. Our overall hypothesis is that donor volunteers who are Black or Hispanic are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, due to modifiable differences that either (1) are already present at the start of the evaluation, o (2) arise later in the evaluation process. To test this hypothesis, we propose a sequential mixed methods study. First, we will perform qualitative interviews of donor volunteers who previously discontinued their donor evaluations, to identify all the potentially modifiable causes of discontinuation of the donor evaluation (Aim 1). Then, in the quantitative component, we will perform a prospective cohort study of 2,800 live kidney donor volunteers at two large transplant centers in New Jersey and California. Among 575 Black, 875 Hispanic, and 1,350 White donor volunteers, we will determine differences in potentially modifiable factors that are present at the start of the donor evaluation (Aim 2) or arise during the evaluation (Aim 3), and also determine the impact of modifiable factors upon successful completion of the donor evaluation (Aim 4) and actual donation, directly or via paired exchange (Aim 5). At the end of this study, we will understand how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their potentially modifiable social, behavioral, and health services characteristics and how these factors impact both completion of the evaluation and actual donation. Our results, generalizable to the 230+ kidney transplant centers in the U.S., will enable us to design future interventions to improve the education, support, and care of live donor volunteers, to ultimately decrease racial/ethnic disparities in LDKT.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For patients with kidney failure, the best treatment option is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but Blacks and Hispanics with kidney failure are much less likely to receive LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics may receive fewer LDKTs because their live donor volunteers are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, possibly due to modifiable reasons. This study will examine how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their motivation, education, perceptions of care, and socioeconomic barriers to donation, and how these potentially modifiable factors impact whether donor volunteers successfully complete evaluation and actually donate.                ",Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation,8771591,R01MD007664,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Saints ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' volunteer ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,ST.

"Does geographic access to care impact pediatric ESRD outcomes?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Department of Health and Human Services Final Rule states that organ allocation ""shall not be based on the candidate's place of residence or place of listing"", yet depending on where a child lives, his median waiting time for a deceased donor kidney transplant varies from 14-1313 days. Beyond individual factors, we do not understand why such wide geographic variation in pediatric kidney transplant access exists. The broad, long- term objective of this proposal is to move science forward by informing targeted interventions to reduce disparities in transplant access for children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This study will use novel geospatial analytical approaches to characterize the attributes of where children with ESRD live and where they seek transplantation, and we will gain insight into how these attributes interact to influence access to pediatric wait listing and transplant. Using an innovative ecological model which incorporates individual, community-level and institutional-level factors, we will disentangle the multiple factors which contribute to differental access to kidney transplant for children. For Aim 1, we will use robust national data to empirically derive a community-level health risk score for each patient's residential neighborhood and evaluate whether community-level health risk impacts transplant access. We hypothesize that children living in communities with less favorable social determinants of health will experience longer time from incident ESRD to wait listing and lower probability of transplant. For Aim 2, we will examine how community-level health risks interact with geospatial access to transplant for children with incident ESRD. We hypothesize that children living in ""lower-risk"" communities will have shorter time from incident ESRD to wait listing and increased probability of transplant, regardless of geospatial access to transplant centers; whereas for children living in ""higher-risk"" communities, less geospatial access to transplant will pose a significant barrier to wait listing and transplant. We will measure ""geospatial access"" using multiple metrics of the proximity of a patient's residence ZIP code to surrounding transplant centers, including travel distance and time. By examining the dynamic interplay of geography, community-level health and pediatric kidney transplant access, we will be able to identify how and where interventions should be implemented to reduce disparities. These results will inform the national discourse on how to improve quality, equity and access to care for all children. The NIH and NIDDK have emphasized the need for more rigorous research studies to 1) increase understanding of community influences on health behaviors and 2) to develop and test more effective interventions to reduce or eliminate health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize where children with ESRD live and where they seek transplantation and to gain understanding of how these factors influence transplant access. This study's findings will inform the design of targeted interventions to reduce inequities in access to care for all children, regardless of where they liv.

"CKD-Targeted Analyses of the Jackson Heart Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects over 26 million Americans. Racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence and incidence of CKD. For example, nationally representative data demonstrate that 19.4% of all African Americans have CKD stage 3 or above, and the most recent data on endstage renal disease (ESRD) indicate African Americans have the highest prevalence and incidence of ESRD in the United States. Unique social, cultural, and behavioral characteristics as well as novel biologic risk factors may contribute to the development and progression of CKD in African Americans, but these pathways have not been adequately defined. The goal of the current grant application is to develop a chronic kidney disease (CKD) working group to evaluate CKD and CKD risk factors among the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohorts, to assess risk factors for the progression of CKD and development of endstage renal disease (ESRD), and to determine the influence of CKD on development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Although much is known regarding disparities in the incidence of ESRD, less is known regarding the contribution of differences in novel biologic, behavioral, and social/cultural risk factors to the development of CKD in African Americans. JHS will provide a NIH-funded cohort with which to study the association of CKD and CVD outcomes and death among a population of African Americans. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1: Develop infrastructure for a highly-functioning diverse, national CKD working group for the Jackson Heart Study with expertise in health disparities, epidemiology, and biostatistics; Aim 2: Examine the association of novel and traditional risk factors for CKD, progression of CKD, and ESRD in the JHS cohort. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationship of CKD with traditional CVD risk factors, intermediate cardiac outcomes, incident CVD and death in the JHS cohort.  This research will develop 1) the infrastructure for a successful productive CKD working group, 2) a research agenda that will elucidate determinants of development, progression and outcomes of CKD in the JHS and 3) a future workforce capable of conducting high quality research on the interrelationship of CKD and CVD, thereby improving the public health of African Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE STATEMENT Background and Rationale: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an important public health problem due its high prevalence, morbidity, and poor health outcomes. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected with CKD and currently, African Americans have the highest incidence of kidney failure in the world and are less likely to be transplanted. Identification of reversible risk factors early in the course of disease would help to identify and target patients who are at high risk for potential interventions. This application will develop the infrastructure or a national Jackson Heart Study CKD working group that will evaluate novel and non-traditional risk factors for CKD. To that end the specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop infrastructure for a highly-functioning diverse, national CKD working group for the Jackson Heart Study with expertise in health disparities, epidemiology, and biostatistics; Aim 2: Examine the association of novel and traditional risk factors for CKD, progression of CKD, and ESRD in the JHS cohort. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationship of CKD with traditional CVD risk factors, intermediate cardiac outcomes, incident CVD and death in the JHS cohort. This research will develop 1) the infrastructure for a successful productive CKD working group, 2) a research agenda that will elucidate determinants of development, progression and outcomes of CKD in the JHS and 3) a future workforce capable of conducting high quality research on the interrelationship of CKD and CVD, thereby improving the public health of African Americans.

"Racial and Cardiovascular Risk Factor Anomalies in CKD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving maintenance dialysis therapy the proportion of African American patients is significantly higher compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts, and traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and obesity show seemingly anomalous, inverse associations with adverse outcomes. The exceptionally high prevalence of end- stage renal disease (ESRD) among African Americans is likely a result of the complex interaction of their higher rates of CKD incidence and/or faster CKD progression, lower mortality, and lower likelihood of kidney transplantation. The anomalous cardiovascular risk factor profile in ESRD could be the result of short-term competing risks related to malnutrition and inflammation, with the seemingly unfavorable traditional cardiovascular risk factors associating with a better nutritional state, which could differentially affect African Americans an hence provide one explanation for their better survival in ESRD. Whether similar paradoxical differences in mortality rates in non-dialysis dependent CKD stages exist is not clear; their presence, extent, the CKD stage of its occurrence and their mechanisms of action all need to be clarified in sufficient detail to allow for the design of proper diagnostic and interventional strategies towards cardiovascular risk reduction and towards alleviating racial disparities in outcomes. In the spirit of PA-09-196 we will utilize data obtained from the national VA research database which is the only large administrative database with detailed socio-demographic and clinical information on very large numbers of individuals (over 4 million individuals including ove 0.5 million with CKD) across all parts of the US. We will examine the population-wide dynamic effects of incident CKD and mortality on racial composition and on changes in cardiovascular risk factor profiles by examining longitudinally a cohort of patients with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate. We will explore the effects of various socio-demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, biochemical measurements and medication use on mortality and progressive CKD using complex epidemiologic methods including joint modeling to assess the effect of longitudinal changes in risk factor parameters on mortality and marginal structural models in order to adjust for both baseline and time-dependent confounders. This three-year project will generate a wealth of information to more reliably examine the above hypotheses related to racial and cardiovascular discrepancies in the outcomes of patients with all levels of kidney function that could have significant public health implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CKD is a prototype for a chronic disease state and is recognized as a global epidemic and a Healthy People 2020 priority area. It is also now recognized as a CVD risk factor and most studies suggest the presence of CKD is a more powerful predictor of CV events than all traditional CV risk factors with the possible exceptions of diabetes and hypertension. Advancing our understanding of the changes in mortality risk profile from normal eGFR to advancing stages of CKD will yield invaluable insights into socio-cultural, clinical and biologic influences on mortality risk and how they interact during the development of a chronic disease state. Given the role of chronic diseases on both the personal and financial burden to our nation, this study is designed to enhance our understanding of chronic disease prevention and early intervention, and ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.            ",Racial and Cardiovascular Risk Factor Anomalies in CKD,8635349,R01DK096920,"['Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anemia ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' bone ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Evolution ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Malnutrition ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' alternative treatment ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2014,299596,0.11064997614576702
"A regionally coordinated intervention to reduce racial disparities in access to k     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation (KTx) among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of KTx is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to KTx are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the KTx process. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to use community- based participatory research approaches to develop, test, and disseminate sustainable, community interventions improve access to KTx for AA ESRD patients. In this planning grant, our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. To determine the patient-, dialysis facility-, and neighborhood-level barriers to KTx in ESRD Network 6. Specific Aim 2: To develop a multilevel intervention to reduce racial disparities in access to KTx. Specific Aim 3: To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a pilot intervention to reduce disparities in' KTx access in GA. The long-term impact of this application will be to reduce racial disparities in the kidney disease community.         RELEVANCE: The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of KTx is the lowest in the nation.

"Improving Primary Care to Narrow Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem affecting over 30 million US adults, who are at increased risk for hospitalization, cardiovascular disease, progression to end-stage renal disease, and death. African Americans are disproportionately affected by CKD, experiencing a four-fold greater incidence of end-stage renal disease than Whites. Receipt of high-quality primary care for patients with CKD creates opportunities for patients to identify and treat their risks for CKD progression and represents a key strategy for both improving patients' clinical outcomes overall and for addressing racial disparities in CKD progression. Evidence suggests that, overall, the primary care of patients with CKD (including patients' appropriate utilization of primary care services, primary care providers' appropriate management of CKD, and high-quality patient-physician discussions about CKD) is lacking. Studies identifying the contribution of suboptimal primary care to racial disparities in CKD outcomes have not previously been performed. Further, mechanisms through which interventions to improve primary care might narrow disparities are unknown. The overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) conduct a retrospective cohort study to quantify differences in the utilization of primary care services and the quality of CKD care among African American and Whites with CKD and explore the contribution of these differences to racial disparities in CKD outcomes, 2) conduct a cross- sectional study to identify key system-, provider-, and patient-level factors contributing to racial disparities in utilization and quality of CKD care in primary care settings, and 3) conduct a prospective cohort study of African Americans with CKD, to assess the quality of patients' interactions with their primary care providers about CKD, and to explore the association of high-quality interactions with patients' improved understanding and self-management of their risks for CKD progression.  The candidate for this mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Raquel Greer, is a General Internist and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and her long-term career goal is to establish her independence as a patient-oriented researcher addressing mechanisms leading to ethnic/racial disparities in CKD. During the award, Dr. Greer will undergo a rigorous didactic and research program, including an advanced, intensive set of didactic courses, seminars, and practical research experience that will substantially build her skills in developing and studying interventions to address ethnic/racial disparities in the care of patients with CKD. These career development activities will be conducted within the rich training environment of Johns Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research with direct guidance from outstanding mentors and advisors with expertise in studying the health care and clinical outcomes of patients with CKD, health disparities research, and other related research methods. These activities will provide Dr. Greer with a solid foundation for her successful transition toward gaining independent funding as a clinician investigator skilled in performing studies to address ethnic/racial disparities in te clinical care and outcomes of patients with CKD.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ethnic/racial minorities are more frequently affected by chronic kidney disease than non-minorities, and they experience worse clinical outcomes than non-minorities. Providing patients with high-quality primary care is a key strategy for improving their health outcomes overall and for addressing race differences in health outcomes.

"Chronic Kidney Disease Knowledge and Awareness among American Indians DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. The overarching goal of this K23 award is to provide Dr. Stacey Jolly, an Alaska Native academic general internist, with the training, research skills, experience, and professional development to establish an independent program of chronic kidney disease-related research. Her proposed training program consists of three core components: (1) community based and translational research principles; (2) qualitative methods and survey design; and, (3) methodology, implementation, and evaluation of prospective clinical trials. She has proposed formal coursework, tutorials, and practical experience for each of the components. She will learn about and incorporate community based and translational research principles. She will develop new analytic skills in the area of qualitative and mixed methods research. She will learn how to translate rich qualitative data into quantitative approaches, specifically survey development. She will learn how to create culturally and content appropriate chronic kidney disease educational materials in the form of computerized digital stories made by American Indians. She will test this inventive modality in a pilot interventional trial with the aim of increasing chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness and chronic kidney disease protective behaviors among American Indians, as well as assessing feasibility acceptability, and effect size. At the completion, she will be well suited to obtain independent research funding. Her career will advance not only as a physician researcher but in academic medicine as well moving from the Assistant to Associate Professor level. Environment. The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, and its affiliate Case Western Reserve University are the major education and research facilities in Cleveland, OH. Dr. Jolly is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. She will benefit from a rich, multidisciplinary mentorship and training environment, which includes experts in nephrology, qualitative methods, public health, epidemiology, biostatistics, and health disparities research. Dr. Ashwini Sehgal is a Professor of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University and Principal Investigator of the Case Center for Reducing Health Disparities will serve as Dr. Jolly's primary mentor. Dr. Spero Manson is a Professor of Medicine at University of Colorado Denver and Principal Investigator of the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health will serve as a co-mentor. Dr. Cheryl Killion is an Associate Professor of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University and qualitative methods expert will serve as a co-mentor. Dr. Jolly brings together a diverse mentorship team, consultants, and advisory committee members that offer extensive research experience, especially among American Indians, and support of her career development program. The site of her research project and data collection will be in South Dakota in which she will work closely with the Strong Heart Study Dakota Center run by Marcia O'Leary of Missouri Breaks Research Industries, Inc. The Strong Heart Study is a well established NIH/NHLBI funded study. Research Project. The goal of this project is to assess chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness among American Indians in the Northern Plains who have metabolic syndrome. Prior work among the general population and some minority populations adversely affected by chronic kidney disease has shown low knowledge and awareness of the condition. To our knowledge, no study has examined in detail chronic kidney disease knowledge, awareness, and beliefs among American Indians. This study proposes to conduct a series of focus groups and create a chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness survey. Few educational intervention clinical trials have been conducted among those at risk for or with early chronic kidney disease. To our knowledge none have used digital storytelling as a means to deliver the educational messaged and have been conducted among American Indians, a group with high prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease.    The aims of the research project are to:   1) Quantify levels of chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness among American Indians with metabolic syndrome.    2) Determine the effectiveness of a culturally tailored health presentation with computerized digital stories made by American Indians compared to a conventional health video presentation only for improving chronic kidney disease knowledge and factors thought to be preventative of chronic kidney disease or its progression at baseline and follow-up in a pilot clinical intervention trial.    In summary, with this K23 award, Dr. Jolly will be able to focus the majority of her time and effort on career development and research to acquire the advanced training and receive the critical mentorship needed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is a chronic medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and a public health problem. Chronic kidney disease can lead to kidneys failing and needing to be on a dialysis kidney machine or have a kidney transplant. It seems a lot of people do not know they have chronic kidney disease or are at risk for getting chronic kidney disease.

"Increasing Equity in Transplant Evaluation and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). But, the evaluation process for a kidney transplant is lengthy, time consuming, and burdensome to the patient. Also, race disparities exist in rates of transplant evaluation completion, transplantation, and LDKT. Our previous and ongoing NIDDK-funded research indicates that cultural factors (i.e., perceived discrimination in health care, religious objection to LDKT), transplant knowledge, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, education, income) independently and significantly predict time to complete transplant evaluation. In December 2012 our transplant center implemented a one-day streamlined evaluation process, dubbed Kidney Transplant Fast Track (KTFT), but it has not been evaluated for efficacy or cost effectiveness. Thus, we propose a quasi-experiment to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the KTFT (n=1030) compared to historical controls (n=1140) who were recruited for our current NIDDK study to increase transplant rates. At the same time, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting vulnerable patients with the educational component of the TALK intervention (Talking About Live Kidney Donation) to increase LDKT. For both components of the application, we will target vulnerable populations because they are most at risk for extended evaluation times and lower rates of LDKT. Using CONSORT standards, participants will be randomly assigned to TALK (n=515) versus no-TALK (n=515) conditions and undergo two interviews at pre-transplant work-up and at completion of transplant evaluation in order to: (1) test whether KTFT and TALK will reduce transplant evaluation time, and increase rates of transplant and LDKT in members of vulnerable groups; (2) determine whether engaging in a streamlined and coordinated-care evaluation experience within the transplant center reduces negative perceptions of the healthcare system; and (3) test the cost effectiveness of the KTFT with TALK relative to standard practices. The results of this two-pronged approach will help pave the way for other transplant centers to implement a Fast Track system at their sites, improve quality of care by transplanting a larger number of vulnerable patients, and may help address stark race/ethnic disparities in rates of LDKT.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority patients are more likely than whites to have end stage kidney disease (ESKD), but less likely to complete transplant evaluation, receive a kidney transplant (KT) overall, or a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESKD. We will test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of a comprehensive, system-level Fast Track kidney transplant evaluation for minorities in reducing time to complete transplant evaluation and increase KT. And, using a randomized-controlled trial, we will test the effectiveness of an educational video and booklet to encourage discussion and pursuit of LDKT. Findings from this work may help reduce disparities in transplant evaluation and LDKT.            ",Increasing Equity in Transplant Evaluation and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation,8816978,R01DK101715,"['Age ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Work ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Reporting ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,566005,0.17311313284328367
"Gender Disparity in Liver Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this multi-disciplinary project is to provide this outstanding candidate with mentored training in patient-oriented research focused on complications of cirrhosis and liver transplantation (LT) outcomes and to prepare her for a career as an independent clinician-scientist. The candidate's research and training activities will be closely supervised and guided by a primary mentor, co-mentors, an Advisory Committee and consultants, each with unique expertise germane to different aspects of the proposed project. The candidate's preliminary data showed that women with serum creatinine (Cr) e 1.0 mg/dl had lower survival rates on the LT waiting list compared to men; this was likely caused by underestimating renal dysfunction in women when using Cr rather than glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to calculate Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Moreover, serum Cr is not an accurate biomarker to detect kidney dysfunction in cirrhosis regardless of gender. The PI will test the hypotheses that (1) gender disparity is caused by underestimating severity of kidney disease in women when using serum Cr rather than GFR to calculate MELD scores, (2) that cystatin C and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) are more accurate biomarkers of renal function in cirrhosis than Cr, and (3) that an equation that includes serum cystatin C, SDMA or both and patient characteristics will be more accurate and precise for determining renal dysfunction in subjects with cirrhosis than existing Cr- and cystatin C-based GFR-estimating equations that were derived in populations without cirrhosis. To test these hypotheses, the PI proposes three Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that gender disparity on the LT waiting list is caused by underestimating renal dysfunction in women when using serum Cr rather than GFR to calculate MELD scores. The PI will elucidate factors underlying gender disparity on the LT waiting list by analyzing United Network for Organ Sharing data of subjects with cirrhosis listed between 2002 and 2009. 2) Establish an accurate biomarker of kidney function in cirrhosis. The PI will enroll 100 subjects with cirrhosis, directly measure GFR using the validated method of non-radiolabeled iothalamate plasma clearance and simultaneously measure serum cystatin C, SDMA, Cr and 24-hour urinary Cr clearance and compare the accuracy of each biomarker for estimating true GFR. 3) Develop an accurate and precise equation to estimate GFR in cirrhosis. The PI will derive and assess the performance of a novel GFR-estimating equation in cirrhosis, based on serum cystatin C, SDMA or both and patient characteristics. The results of this study are anticipated to spur modifications of the MELD score that will reduce gender disparity in liver allocation and establish an inexpensive, readily available, accurate, non-invasive measure of kidney function in cirrhosis. The mentored research training and courses supported by this K23 award will provide the PI with excellent grounding for a successful academic career in health services and patient-oriented research.         Cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver) is a leading cause of death and the most common indication for liver transplantation. Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk to develop kidney disease. If kidney disease is not timely and accurately detected in patients with cirrhosis, it may progress to kidney failure and lead to higher mortality rates in women on the liver transplant waiting list causing gender disparity. Currently, existing blood and urine tests are not sensitive enough to detect kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis. This proposed project will examine the gender disparity on the liver transplant waiting list, how well the kidneys work (kidney function) and determine which blood tests are the most accurate for detecting kidney disease in cirrhosis.

"Myeloablative T- Replete Haploidentical PBSCT for Patients Without MRD or MUD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many patients, particularly those from ethnic minorities, are unable to access the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation due to the lack of a suitable donor. For such patients, umbilical cord blood can offer an alternative source of hematopoietic cells. However, adults typically require the concurrent use of two cord blood units (DCBT) at considerable expense. In adults such transplants are also associated with delayed immune reconstitution, increased rate of infections and a higher treatment related mortality than transplants from conventional donors. Recently the use of haploidentical (partially matched related donor) hematopoietic cell transplants (haplo-HCT) using T-cell-replete marrow grafts and post- transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have been shown to produce high rates of engraftment and low treatment related mortality (TRM) when used with a non-myeloablative preparative regimen, in patients who lack conventional donors. However, such transplants have limited efficacy in aggressive/advanced myeloid malignancies because of a high relapse rate. In an institutional pilot trial, we have assessed the use of T- replete mobilized peripheral blood (PBSC) and a myeloablative preparative regimen with haplo-HCT + PTCy. Despite the advanced and high-risk nature of the malignancies treated, estimated 6 month TRM was 14% and disease-free survival was 72%. All patients engrafted and developed full donor chimerism in CD3+ and CD33+ cells by day +30. A multi-institutional phase II trial is therefore proposed within the BMT CTN to confirm these encouraging results. The proposed trial will test the hypothesis that this novel approach to myeloablative haplo-HCT is safe and effective when used in a multi-institutional setting. Upon successful completion of this phase II trial, a randomized phase 111 comparison is proposed between this approach to haplo-HCT and myeloablative DCBT. The objective of this phase 111 study will be to directly compare these two approaches to alternative donor transplantation with respect to safety, toxicity, efficacy, cost and immune reconstitution. This trial would definitively determine the best option for myeloablative transplantation in patients with advanced malionancies who lack a matched-sibling or matched unrelated donor RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed research addresses a significant current deficiency in public health. Specifically, it tests a novel strategy that will enable curative myeloablative blood stem cell transplants in patients (particularly those from underserved minorities) who are currently unable to access them due to lack of a conventional donor. If successful, it will transform the standard-of-care by offering life-saving therapy to patients who would have died from their cancer and close a major disparity in healthcare access for ethnic minorities.

"Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are less likely to become registered organ donors. In addition, although first-person consent laws have been passed in 48 states, hospitals remain reluctant to harvest organs without the consent of the registered donor's family. Epidemiologic studies on African Americans have focused on the willingness to donate organs. Little research has been done on the positive decision-making process of becoming a registered organ donor. Objectives: The goal of this project is to identify facilitators associated with becoming a registered organ donor and providing familial notification. We hypothesize that positive outcome expectations (physical, social, and self-evaluative) will be associated with increased African American organ donor registration. We also hypothesize that increased perceived self-efficacy (PSE) will be associated with increased familial notification. Design and Methods: Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a guiding framework, a qualitative study involving focus groups will be performed and then validated by large-scale quantitative telephone surveys. African Americans, age 19 and older, who made a decision regarding organ donation at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past 3 months will be stratified into those who chose to become a registered organ donor and those who declined. The dependent variables for analysis will be 1) becoming a registered organ donor and 2) family notification of the decision to become a registered organ donor. Significance: The study will identify the key factors that drive African Americans to become registered organ donors and the determinants of familial notification. This data will inform future interventions to increase African American donor registration and develop mechanisms to ensure family consent, thereby reducing disparities in organ donation and improving the health outcomes of African Americans.      African Americans who registered at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past three months will be stratified into those who chose to be an organ donor and those who declined. A qualitative study involving focus groups and validated by quantitative surveys will be performed to determine the factors associated with the decision of African Americans to become registered organ donors and to inform their families of their donation wishes.

"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8700987,K22LM011869,"['Age ', ' Albumins ', ' Archives ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communities ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Creatinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' forest ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' Visit ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Career Transition Award ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' medically underserved ', ' informatics training ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' multiple reaction monitoring ', ' screening ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2014,132121,0.15324710777145464
"Chronic Kidney Disease in Disadvantaged Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Yoshio Hall, an Assistant Professor in nephrology at the University of Washington. Dr. Hall is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in medically underserved populations. This K23 award will provide Dr. Hall with training and mentored research experience in the following areas: (1) recruiting and maintaining a patient cohort; (2) performing and validating diagnostic tests; (3) developing and maintaining a CKD registry from multiple data sources; (4) training in health information technology, (5) training in advanced statistical and epidemiologic methods; and (6) designing pilot intervention studies. To achieve these goals, Dr. Hall has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Jonathan Himmelfarb, Director of the Kidney Research Institute and Professor of Medicine, who is recognized internationally as a leader in translational and outcomes research in persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and acute kidney injury, and two co-mentors: Dr. Edward Boyko, Acting Head of the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Washington and former Director of the VA-funded Epidemiologic Research and Information Center, who is an internationally known investigator in the epidemiology of diabetes and obesity with extensive experience in disease registry development and management; and Dr. Glenn Chertow, Chief of Nephrology and Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, who is internationally recognized as a leader in improving care for persons with acute and chronic kidney disease . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health problem which affects more than 26 million Americans. In the US, members of racial-ethnic minority groups and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of CKD, particularly ESRD. We hypothesize that the disparate rates of ESRD among these at-risk groups reflect a pattern of underutilization of care. We further hypothesize that public health systems which disproportionately care for diverse populations do not consistently identify or provide recommended care to persons with CKD who are at highest risk for progressive disease. We will test these hypotheses using a series of analyses that leverage data from (1) Harborview Medical Center, the largest public hospital system in the northwestern United States; and (2) The Community Health Network, a large safety net health system in northern California. This research will form the basis for patient-centered interventions to improve the delivery of care to diverse populations. Public health relevance: Improved understanding of local- and system-level barriers to care delivery in historically disadvantaged populations may reduce pervasive racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in care and decrease the growing burden of CKD and ESRD to society.        Chronic kidney disease is defined as the presence of persistent kidney damage and/or loss of kidney function. In the United States, chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 27 million Americans and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and cost. In this country, racial-ethnic minority groups and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of chronic kidney disease, particularly end-stage renal disease. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that modifiable local- and system-level factors can be identified which influence the delivery of care and impact long-term risk for development and progression of chronic kidney disease to ESRD among disadvantaged populations.

"Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but large racial disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. In 2009, Blacks, who comprised 36.9% of the dialysis population, received 32.4% of deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKTs) but just 13.7% of LDKTs. A multi- component intervention that addresses the many barriers that impede LDKT (e.g. transplant candidates' lack of knowledge about LDKT; fears regarding donor's future health; guilt; and discomfort with discussing LDKT) could plausibly increase LDKT among Blacks. Our main objective is to test an educational and behavioral intervention that is designed to increase receipt of LDKT among newly-listed transplant candidates who are Black. We hypothesize that a multi-component intervention will increase both readiness to pursue LDKT and actual receipt of LDKTs among Blacks. We propose a parallel group, two-arm randomized trial among 500 Black kidney transplant candidates. After Blacks are placed on the waiting list for a DDKT, we will randomly assign them to either: (1) a control group that will receive Usual Care, or (2) an Intervention group that will receive a culturally sensitive, group-based intervention. Participants randomized to the Intervention will be asked to attend a 60-90 minute small group seminar (family and friends strongly encouraged to attend) that will feature brief talks regarding: basic facts about CKD, transplant, and the waiting list; basic facts about live kidney donation; the experience of receiving a transplant and LDKT; the experience of serving as a live kidney donor; and skill-building regarding how to ask for a live donor. These talks will directly address the barriers that impede LDKT. Physicians and Black LDKT recipients and live donors will lead these talks, supplemented by educational videos. In our preparatory aim, we will develop the Intervention and train the speakers. Our primary aim will compare LDKT readiness and LDKT receipt in the Intervention vs. Usual Care groups of our randomized clinical trial; our primary outcome is change in readiness to pursue LDKT, and our main secondary outcome is actual receipt of LDKT, after 18 months of follow-up. Our secondary aims will determine (a) the social and behavioral variables that modify the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt; and (b) whether changes in social and behavioral factors mediate the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. This clinical trial will occur at two neighboring transplant centers that share the same policies, procedures, and personnel. In an average year, these two centers combine to place over 200 Blacks on the DDKT waiting list and perform over 135 LDKTs (including ~29 among Blacks). By intervening upon patients ""distal"" in the transplant process, at two centers that perform many LDKTs, we have excellent power to detect a beneficial effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. At the end of this study, we will have developed and tested a culturally sensitive educational and behavioral Intervention that has the potential to increase receipt of LDKT among Blacks and decrease the striking racial disparities in receipt of LDKT.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blacks with kidney failure are much less likely to receive a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which is usually the best treatment for kidney failure. We propose a randomized clinical trial to test an intervention consisting of practical but potent educational seminars that will feature video-based modules and ""live"" talks by physicians, LDKT recipients, and live donors. Among 500 kidney transplant candidates who are Black and newly activated on the transplant waiting list, our trial will determine whether this Intervention (compared to Usual Care) increases readiness for and receipt of LDKT.",Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist,8724960,R01DK098744,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Guilt ', ' Health ', ' Israel ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Friends ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Policies ', ' Saints ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' volunteer ', ' stem ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,ST.

"Impact of Cardiovascular Risk Control on Racial Disparities in Kidney Transplant     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the applicant is to become an independent investigator who designs and executes studies to optimize medication utilization in kidney transplant patients, with the specific goals of reducing racial disparities in graft surviva. Black renal transplant recipients are at significantly higher risk for graft loss following kidney transplant due, in part, to well recognized immunologic hyper-responsiveness, poorer socioeconomic status and more severe comorbid conditions. Much of the previous interventions to reduce disparities in Black recipients have focused on improving access to transplant and reducing immunologic risks; yet the differences in graft survival rates between Black and non-Black kidney transplant patients have not significantly improved. To date, little attention has been directed towards improving CVD risk factor control as a potential approach to reduce racial disparities in kidney transplant. The proposed research plan will seek to test the hypothesis that CVD risk factor control significantly influences racial disparities in kidney transplant outcomes through a two phase study. Phase 1: a large-scale longitudinal cohort study conducted using national datasets (VA, CMS, and USRDS) that critically analyzes the modifying impact of CVD risk factor control on racial disparities among kidney transplants. Phase 2: The C-DRIFT trial (Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Control in Kidney Transplant) is a prospective study to explore the feasibility and potential effectiveness of pharmacist-led patient-level interventions directed at improving CVD risk factor control as a mechanism to reduce racial disparities in kidney transplant recipients. Completing these studies will provide novel and compelling preliminary data, so that by the conclusion of this award, a grant proposal will be submitted to conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial powered to test the hypothesis that optimizing CVD risk factor control will improve graft survival and racial disparities in kidney transplant patients. Additionally and equally as important, the completion of this grant will provide the applicant invaluable training and mentoring that will allow him to develop the skillset necessary to become an independently funded investigator. The proposed career development plan capitalizes on the rich interdisciplinary collaborative environment, the unique patient population, and the comprehensive didactic coursework available at the Medical University of South Carolina. The primary mentor and co-mentors on this application are highly experienced and well-funded researchers that have expertise in conducting research in racial disparities, kidney transplant and CVD interventional studies. Thus, at the conclusion of this award, novel data regarding the impact of CVD risk factor control on racial disparities in kidney transplant will be produced and disseminated while the applicant develops into a well-trained researcher, capable of conducing relevant patient-oriented research in kidney transplant recipients.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited research has been focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor management as a mechanism to minimize inequalities in Black kidney transplant recipients. Pharmacist-led patient-level interventions to improve CVD risk factor control are novel and promising methods to improve outcomes in these high-risk patients. The aims of this grant are to better understand the role of CVD risk factor control on racial disparitis in kidney transplantation, explore promising mechanisms to improve CVD risk factor control while developing the applicant into a well-trained patient-oriented researcher.        ",Impact of Cardiovascular Risk Control on Racial Disparities in Kidney Transplant,8698957,K23DK099440,"['Attention ', ' Award ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Grant ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Life ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Improve Access ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' graft function ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' diabetes control ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NIDDK,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K23,2014,166939,0.06584590491772781
"Health Literacy in Hispanics with Chronic Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 for Dr. Claudia Lora, who proposes the first systematic examination of health literacy in Hispanics with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This award will allow Dr. Lora the resources and protected time to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming a successful, independent patient-oriented researcher focusing on health care disparities in Hispanics with CKD. While Hispanics currently comprise 15% of the population, they are projected to comprise a quarter of the US population by 2050, Hispanics with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, a better understanding of the factors contributing to the progression of CKD in Hispanics is critical for reducing health disparities and developing therapeutic interventions. Health literacy is known to be associated with health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been well studied in the context of CKD. The potential for health literacy to affect patients' chronic disease management has been recognized by the Institute of Medicine, which in 2004, issued a call to action for research in health literac. Examining health literacy in Hispanics is of utmost importance because minorities and non-English speakers are more likely to have low functional health literacy than non-Hispanic whites. Low health literacy likely contributes to poor health outcomes in Hispanics with CKD through various mechanisms including disease knowledge, access to health care, and health behaviors. By understanding the relationship between health literacy and CKD, we may identify a therapeutic target in CKD progression. In view of the disproportionate burden of kidney disease in Hispanics, the proposed study will examine health literacy in a cohort of Hispanics with CKD. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) To examine health literacy as a predictor for progression of kidney disease in Hispanics with CKD; 2) To examine health literacy as a predictor for cardiovascular events and progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in Hispanics with CKD; and 3) To develop and field test a culturally sensitive, low-literacy, touch tablet application to improve knowledge of hypertension in Hispanics with CKD. The project contains novel concepts and strategies, and will result in the development of a new therapeutic intervention that could improve the health of Hispanics with CKD. The strengths of the proposal are the comprehensive career development plan, the experience and commitment of the mentoring team, and the strong institutional resources and support. In addition, the proposed research is innovative, addresses a growing public health problem, leverages the infrastructure of an ongoing NIH-funded cohort study, and will allow the applicant to gain the skills and experience needed to develop into an independent patient-oriented researcher.      Health literacy is known to influence health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been studied in Hispanics with predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). In view of the disproportionate burden of CKD in U.S. Hispanics, the mentored research has two overarching goals: 1) To examine health literacy as a predictor of CKD progression and cardiovascular outcomes in Hispanics with CKD and 2) To develop and pilot a low- literacy, touch tablet application to improve knowledge of hypertension in Hispanics with CKD, which will serve as the basis for a future R01 proposal. The proposed study will advance my research skills towards developing into an independent investigator and the knowledge gained has the potential to advance concepts that drive the field and thereby minimize health disparities in Hispanics with CKD.

"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8929292,K22LM011869,"['Age ', ' Albumins ', ' Archives ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communities ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Creatinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' forest ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' Visit ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Career Transition Award ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' medically underserved ', ' informatics training ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' multiple reaction monitoring ', ' screening ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2015,132348,0.15324710777145464
"Increasing Equity in Transplant Evaluation and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). But, the evaluation process for a kidney transplant is lengthy, time consuming, and burdensome to the patient. Also, race disparities exist in rates of transplant evaluation completion, transplantation, and LDKT. Our previous and ongoing NIDDK-funded research indicates that cultural factors (i.e., perceived discrimination in health care, religious objection to LDKT), transplant knowledge, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, education, income) independently and significantly predict time to complete transplant evaluation. In December 2012 our transplant center implemented a one-day streamlined evaluation process, dubbed Kidney Transplant Fast Track (KTFT), but it has not been evaluated for efficacy or cost effectiveness. Thus, we propose a quasi-experiment to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the KTFT (n=1030) compared to historical controls (n=1140) who were recruited for our current NIDDK study to increase transplant rates. At the same time, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting vulnerable patients with the educational component of the TALK intervention (Talking About Live Kidney Donation) to increase LDKT. For both components of the application, we will target vulnerable populations because they are most at risk for extended evaluation times and lower rates of LDKT. Using CONSORT standards, participants will be randomly assigned to TALK (n=515) versus no-TALK (n=515) conditions and undergo two interviews at pre-transplant work-up and at completion of transplant evaluation in order to: (1) test whether KTFT and TALK will reduce transplant evaluation time, and increase rates of transplant and LDKT in members of vulnerable groups; (2) determine whether engaging in a streamlined and coordinated-care evaluation experience within the transplant center reduces negative perceptions of the healthcare system; and (3) test the cost effectiveness of the KTFT with TALK relative to standard practices. The results of this two-pronged approach will help pave the way for other transplant centers to implement a Fast Track system at their sites, improve quality of care by transplanting a larger number of vulnerable patients, and may help address stark race/ethnic disparities in rates of LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority patients are more likely than whites to have end stage kidney disease (ESKD), but less likely to complete transplant evaluation, receive a kidney transplant (KT) overall, or a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESKD.

"House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While kidney transplantation is the best treatment option for adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), profound racial and socioeconomic disparities persist. Minorities and low-income patients, for instance, are less likely to receive lve donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), which yields better survival, quality of life, and health care cost outcomes than chronic dialysis or deceased donor transplantation. Guided by a socio- ecological model of LDKT, the PI developed an innovative House Calls intervention that has shown to be effective at overcoming barriers and increasing LDKT rates in Black patients. We now seek to expand the reach and intensity of the House Calls intervention by including other minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and by adding a novel Patient-Centered Decision Support component. Also, little is known about those variables that mediate the intervention's impact on the occurrence of LDKT or whether the intervention can attenuate the growing gender disparity in living donation. In this study, we will pursue three specific aims: (1) evaluate the differential benefit of adding a patient-centered decision support component to the House Calls intervention; (2) identify mediators of the relationship between the interventions and the occurrence of LDKT; and (3) examine whether the House Calls intervention reduces the gender disparity in rates of living kidney donation. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a single-site, randomized controlled trial with a planned enrollment of 100 minority and low income patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Patients will be randomized to receive the House Calls intervention alone (HC) or the House Calls intervention + a web-based Patient-Centered Decision Support intervention (HC+DS). The central hypothesis is that, compared to HC alone, the HC+DS group will have a higher proportion of enrolled patients with LDKT by the 2-yr study endpoint (primary outcome) and higher proportions of enrolled patients with at least one live donor inquiry, at least one live donor evaluation, and in LDKT action (vs. contemplation) stages (secondary outcomes). Also, we will evaluate whether the House Calls intervention (either HC alone or HC+DS) leads to more donor inquiries, evaluations, and actual donations from men, relative to a non-intervention control group, controlling for patient race/ethnicity, gender, age, and household income. By identifying effective interventions for patient populations with historically lower rates of LDKT, we can eliminate many barriers to access, reduce disease burden, and lower mortality rates by producing more donor organs for transplantation. We are especially well-prepared to conduct the proposed research due to the multidisciplinary nature of the research team, as well as the expertise and experience of the team in developing LDKT and living donation educational materials, implementing and evaluating the House Calls intervention, conducting LDKT research with minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, and producing meaningful scientific and clinical outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Certain minorities and low-income patients are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease. While kidney transplantation offers the best option for long-term survival and reduced morbidity, minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged wait longer for kidney transplantation and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in minority and low-income patients. The proposed research is innovative because it further evaluates the relative effectiveness of one of the only empirically-supported interventions to reduce racial disparities in LDKT. Specifically, it will expand the reach of the intervention to include more minority groups, low-income patients, and a novel patient-centered decision support component. Findings from this study have the potential to close the health disparity gap by identifying effective educational and interventional strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT in minority and low-income patients.",House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation,8925068,R01DK098727,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Home Visits ', ' House Call ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Low Income Population ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' Living Donors ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' functional status ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Educational Materials ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Study Section ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,261000,0.1441238320891264
"Effects of Age and Race on GFR Estimation in a Population-based Cohort This protocol will evaluate the utility of the two GFR markers, creatinine and cystatin C, in comparison with measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by iohexol clearance in 375 Black and White adult participants of the population-based Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort from the Johns Hopkins clinical center. Although GFR estimation by creatinine has improved over the past decade, there has been inadequate inclusion of persons over 65 years of age, and no study of GFR measurement has occurred within a population-based sample of Blacks and Whites in the United States. To advance the detection and definition of CKD across a broad age range of diverse adults,, we must focus on the higher ranges of GFR, and we must identify the optimal strategy for GFR estimation. The first Aim of this cross-sectional study will be to determine the influence of Black race-ethnicity on serum levels of filtration markers (creatinine and cystatin C) in the general population, and to modify current GFR equations to capture optimally the influence of Black race. The second Aim will be: to evaluate age-related decline in GFR; to compare the relative ability of the filtration markers to capture declining GFR with age; and, to modify current GFR equations to incorporate the influence of age. In executing these Aims, we will determine the optimal biomarker(s) for GFR estimation � creatinine, cystatin C, or both. In addition, blood specimens will be stored with the potential for examination of future filtration markers. To accomplish our objectives, we will measure iohexol-GFR in approximately 375 Black and White MESA participants, spanning a target age range of 55-95. This study could be a major contributor to the National Institute of Health�s efforts to address the persistent racial disparities in the burden of kidney disease in the United States. Chronic kidney disease is a public health problem that disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the US. The normal levels of kidney function and the accuracy of equations to estimate kidney function are not known in racial and ethnic minorities, which represent barriers to effective clinical practice, research and public health efforts for CKD in these groups. The goals of the proposed project are to characterize the usual levels of kidney function in racial and ethnic minorities; to develop more accurate ways to estimate kidney function in racial and ethnic groups.",Effects of Age and Race on GFR Estimation in a Population-based Cohort,8919877,R01DK087961,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Black race ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' 2-amino-1,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4H-imidazol-4-one ', ' Creatinine ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Filtration Fractionation ', ' Filtration ', ' Future ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Iohexol 350 ', "" 1,3-Benzenedicarboxamide, 5-(acetyl(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)amino)-N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodo- "", ' Iohexol ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' post-gamma-protein ', ' cystatin C ', ' post gamma-globulins ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Sampling ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy aging ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' public health research ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NIDDK,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,236269,0.10704027687234287
"Does geographic access to care impact pediatric ESRD outcomes? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Department of Health and Human Services Final Rule states that organ allocation ""shall not be based on the candidate's place of residence or place of listing"", yet depending on where a child lives, his median waiting time for a deceased donor kidney transplant varies from 14-1313 days. Beyond individual factors, we do not understand why such wide geographic variation in pediatric kidney transplant access exists. The broad, long- term objective of this proposal is to move science forward by informing targeted interventions to reduce disparities in transplant access for children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This study will use novel geospatial analytical approaches to characterize the attributes of where children with ESRD live and where they seek transplantation, and we will gain insight into how these attributes interact to influence access to pediatric wait listing and transplant. Using an innovative ecological model which incorporates individual, community-level and institutional-level factors, we will disentangle the multiple factors which contribute to differental access to kidney transplant for children. For Aim 1, we will use robust national data to empirically derive a community-level health risk score for each patient's residential neighborhood and evaluate whether community-level health risk impacts transplant access. We hypothesize that children living in communities with less favorable social determinants of health will experience longer time from incident ESRD to wait listing and lower probability of transplant. For Aim 2, we will examine how community-level health risks interact with geospatial access to transplant for children with incident ESRD. We hypothesize that children living in ""lower-risk"" communities will have shorter time from incident ESRD to wait listing and increased probability of transplant, regardless of geospatial access to transplant centers; whereas for children living in ""higher-risk"" communities, less geospatial access to transplant will pose a significant barrier to wait listing and transplant. We will measure ""geospatial access"" using multiple metrics of the proximity of a patient's residence ZIP code to surrounding transplant centers, including travel distance and time. By examining the dynamic interplay of geography, community-level health and pediatric kidney transplant access, we will be able to identify how and where interventions should be implemented to reduce disparities. These results will inform the national discourse on how to improve quality, equity and access to care for all children. The NIH and NIDDK have emphasized the need for more rigorous research studies to 1) increase understanding of community influences on health behaviors and 2) to develop and test more effective interventions to reduce or eliminate health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize where children with ESRD live and where they seek transplantation and to gain understanding of how these factors influence transplant access. This study's findings will inform the design of targeted interventions to reduce inequities in access to care for all children, regardless of where they liv.

"Improving Primary Care to Narrow Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem affecting over 30 million US adults, who are at increased risk for hospitalization, cardiovascular disease, progression to end-stage renal disease, and death. African Americans are disproportionately affected by CKD, experiencing a four-fold greater incidence of end-stage renal disease than Whites. Receipt of high-quality primary care for patients with CKD creates opportunities for patients to identify and treat their risks for CKD progression and represents a key strategy for both improving patients' clinical outcomes overall and for addressing racial disparities in CKD progression. Evidence suggests that, overall, the primary care of patients with CKD (including patients' appropriate utilization of primary care services, primary care providers' appropriate management of CKD, and high-quality patient-physician discussions about CKD) is lacking. Studies identifying the contribution of suboptimal primary care to racial disparities in CKD outcomes have not previously been performed. Further, mechanisms through which interventions to improve primary care might narrow disparities are unknown. The overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) conduct a retrospective cohort study to quantify differences in the utilization of primary care services and the quality of CKD care among African American and Whites with CKD and explore the contribution of these differences to racial disparities in CKD outcomes, 2) conduct a cross- sectional study to identify key system-, provider-, and patient-level factors contributing to racial disparities in utilization and quality of CKD care in primary care settings, and 3) conduct a prospective cohort study of African Americans with CKD, to assess the quality of patients' interactions with their primary care providers about CKD, and to explore the association of high-quality interactions with patients' improved understanding and self-management of their risks for CKD progression.  The candidate for this mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Raquel Greer, is a General Internist and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and her long-term career goal is to establish her independence as a patient-oriented researcher addressing mechanisms leading to ethnic/racial disparities in CKD. During the award, Dr. Greer will undergo a rigorous didactic and research program, including an advanced, intensive set of didactic courses, seminars, and practical research experience that will substantially build her skills in developing and studying interventions to address ethnic/racial disparities in the care of patients with CKD. These career development activities will be conducted within the rich training environment of Johns Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research with direct guidance from outstanding mentors and advisors with expertise in studying the health care and clinical outcomes of patients with CKD, health disparities research, and other related research methods. These activities will provide Dr. Greer with a solid foundation for her successful transition toward gaining independent funding as a clinician investigator skilled in performing studies to address ethnic/racial disparities in te clinical care and outcomes of patients with CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ethnic/racial minorities are more frequently affected by chronic kidney disease than non-minorities, and they experience worse clinical outcomes than non-minorities. Providing patients with high-quality primary care is a key strategy for improving their health outcomes overall and for addressing race differences in health outcomes.

"Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are less likely to become registered organ donors.

Epidemiologic studies on African Americans have focused on the willingness to donate organs. Little research has been done on the positive decision-making process of becoming a registered organ donor. Objectives: The goal of this project is to identify facilitators associated with becoming a registered organ donor and providing familial notification. We hypothesize that positive outcome expectations (physical, social, and self-evaluative) will be associated with increased African American organ donor registration. We also hypothesize that increased perceived self-efficacy (PSE) will be associated with increased familial notification. Design and Methods: Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a guiding framework, a qualitative study involving focus groups will be performed and then validated by large-scale quantitative telephone surveys. African Americans, age 19 and older, who made a decision regarding organ donation at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past 3 months will be stratified into those who chose to become a registered organ donor and those who declined. The dependent variables for analysis will be 1) becoming a registered organ donor and 2) family notification of the decision to become a registered organ donor. Significance: The study will identify the key factors that drive African Americans to become registered organ donors and the determinants of familial notification. This data will inform future interventions to increase African American donor registration and develop mechanisms to ensure family consent, thereby reducing disparities in organ donation and improving the health outcomes of African Americans. African Americans who registered at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past three months will be stratified into those who chose to be an organ donor and those who declined. A qualitative study involving focus groups and validated by quantitative surveys will be performed to determine the factors associated with the decision of African Americans to become registered organ donors and to inform their families of their donation wishes.",Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent,8843834,K23DK091514,"['Age ', ' Alabama ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Belief ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disincentive ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Organ Donations ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' Reaction ', ' Visit ', ' Organ Harvestings ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' population based ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2015,181915,0.09349268344638881

"Evaluation of Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation in New National Kidney Allocation Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The public health burden of kidney failure in the United States is substantial, with more than 600,000 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. There are two main treatments for kidney disease - dialysis or kidney transplantation. A complex, multi-tiered national system regulates kidney disease care, reimbursement, and transplantation, creating barriers to overcoming the significant racial disparities that exist in transplantation, the most effective treatment for ESRD. The federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network of the United Network for Organ Sharing oversees the allocation of all deceased donor organs in the US, and on Dec. 4, 2014, a major change to the allocation policy was implemented that is expected to impact racial disparities in transplantation access. We propose to study the impact of the natural experiment offered by enactment of this new kidney allocation policy on reducing disparities in the key steps of referral for transplant evaluation, wit listing, and transplantation, each of which have complexities for measurement at the local and national level. In addition, to impact disparities reduction at the service delivery level, we willuse national data to develop and then disseminate a systems-level practice of providing feedback to dialysis centers about their transplant performance to improve overall wait listing rates and decrease disparities in kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the new kidney allocation policy will lead to a reduction in disparities in transplantation at 1 year, we will prospectively examine the impact of the policy changes on racial disparities in the key steps in the transplant process post- vs. pre- allocation: a) referra from the dialysis facility for transplant evaluation in the Southeast, where we have access to this unique data, and b) wait listing and transplantation in the US. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of a systems-level approach to providing tailored transplant performance feedback and education about the kidney allocation policy, we will conduct a multicomponent, clinical effectiveness-implementation study among 750 US dialysis facilities which treat >50,000 dialysis patients. We anticipate that increasing provider knowledge will reduce disparities in transplant wait listing. The long-term impact of this application will be to influence the way organs are allocated in the US to ensure equitability through better analysis of policy and dissemination of best practices at the health systems level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study seeks to examine whether a change in the national kidney allocation policy resulted in a reduction in racial disparities in access to ke steps to kidney transplantation, and to leverage a systems-based approach to conduct a national effectiveness-implementation study of a tailored performance feedback report among US dialysis facilities with racial disparities in transplant wait listing.                ",Evaluation of Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation in New National Kidney Allocation Policy,8996929,R01MD010290,"['Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Feedback ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Health Policy ', ' North Carolina ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' South Carolina ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Wit ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' federal policy ', ' organ allocation ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,558619,0.14107272964431145
"Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney to benefit a loved one or even a stranger, but the long-term consequences of donating a kidney, particularly in African Americans, are poorly understood. In this study, we will study high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and post-donation treatment patterns in largest ever primary cohort of African American donors, Caucasian American donors, matched healthy non-donor controls (who were cleared for donation but did not ultimately donate because of recipient factors), and other matched healthy individuals (who participated in large cohort studies and were deemed healthy enough to have likely passed a donor evaluation). Our findings will influence the practice of live kidney donation in the United States, particularly among African Americans, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care.",Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans,8862466,R01DK096008,"['Anemia ', ' bone disorder ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medical Records ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Minerals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' Living Donors ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' Agreement ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' loved ones ', ' population based ', ' data registry ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' prehypertension ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,798995,0.17693976748080628
"Molecular Mechanism of APOL1 Associated Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop ESRD at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently we showed that coding sequence variants in the ApolipoproteinL1 (ApoL1) gene, present only in individuals with recent African ancestry, explain a very large proportion of this health disparity. This has now been confirmed by multiple additional studies. ApoL1 variants have a major impact on different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and HIV-associated nephropathy. Individuals with two variant ApoL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. 3.5 million African Americans likely have the high risk ApoL1 genotype. African Americans without two variant alleles have minimal excess risk. At present, little is known about the biology of ApoL1 or its rol in the kidney. ApoL1 has a defined role in resistance to trypanosomes, and the G1 and G2 variants appear to have become common in Africa because they confer protection against the forms of trypanosomes that cause African Sleeping Sickness. Here, our goal is to elucidate the function of ApoL1 and its role in causing human kidney disease in order to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this large disparity in kidney disease risk. ApoL1 is a Bcl2 family member with a BH3-only domain, suggesting a possible role in apoptosis. Our initial experiments in oocytes lead us to believe that this pathway may be an important mechanism of glomerular injury in ApoL1-associated disease. We propose to: 1. Define the cell biology and cell physiology of ApoL1: We will define the basic cellular biology of ApoL1 including biosynthesis, trafficking, ion channel properties, endocytosis, and effects on organellar structure and function. We will compare wild type and renal risk variant ApoL1 biology to understand the mechanisms that lead to kidney disease. 2. Examine specific effects of ApoL1 on apoptosis in podocytes: We hypothesize that ApoL1 risk variants promote podocyte apoptosis via a BH3 domain in the N- terminus and that the renal risk variants enhance ApoL1's pro-apoptotic effects. We will test this hypothesis both in cultured podocytes of different ApoL1 genotypes and by transfecting podocytes with ApoL1 constructs designed to probe the underlying apoptotic mechanisms. 3. Use a zebrafish model to study ApoL1- mediated renal injury in vivo: We will use zebrafish to understand how ApoL1 variants promote glomerular injury. We have demonstrated that the G1 risk variant increases embryonic lethality and causes glomerular pathology, and that wild type ApoL1 can reverse the pathologic phenotype caused by G1. We will examine the effects of heterologous ApoL1 expression in a whole organism using ubiquitous and tissue-specific promoters. We will define the risk variant domains that cause disease and the wild type domains that prevent G1-mediated injury. We will also define the specific interactions between the wild-type, G1, and G2 forms of ApoL1 in vivo. Lastly, we will examine the role of ApoL1 variants in promoting or preventing apoptosis of glomerular cells.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently found that specific genetic variants in a single gene, APOL1, account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We now want to understand precisely how these genetic variants lead to this major disparity in kidney disease at a biological level. This i of major importance in understanding the molecular mechanism of an enormous minority health disparity. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number people with this serious public health problem and ultimately removing a major racial health disparity.            ",Molecular Mechanism of APOL1 Associated Kidney Disease,8791547,R01MD007898,"['Accounting ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biology ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ions ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Oocytes ', ' Organelles ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Pathology ', ' Permeability ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Caring ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' American ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' podocyte ', ' BH3 Domain ', ' Recombinants ', ' in vivo ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,435000,0.042077644085832
"APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease  SUMMARY More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop kidney failure at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently, we discovered two coding sequence variants in ApolipoproteinL1 (APOL1) that account for a large proportion of this major health disparity. APOL1 kidney disease variants have a major impact on multiple different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Risk inheritance is recessive: individuals with two variant APOL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. We predict that more than 3.5 million African Americans have the high risk APOL1 genotype. The presence of two risk alleles does not lead to kidney disease in all individuals, indicating that other genetic and environmental factors are important modifiers. Understanding why some individuals with the high-risk genotype develop kidney disease while others do not will improve risk stratification and may illuminate the pathways most amenable to therapy. We therefore propose to: Aim 1: Identify additional genetic modifiers at the APOL1 gene locus. Our data suggest that APOL1 kidney disease risk variants are gain-of- function alleles. Since not all individuals with two risk alleles develop disease, other local polymorphisms may regulate expression of APOL1, modulating the effect of the disease-causing APOL1 coding mutations. We will define structural variants that may alter APOL1 gene expression, and test their effects on the penetrance of the two disease-causing alleles. We will test whether polymorphisms in transcription factor and microRNA binding sites affect the penetrance of these APOL1 risk alleles. Aim 2: Find epistatic modifiers of APOL1 penetrance. The APOL1 renal risk variants increased in frequency in Africa, at least in part, because they provided protection against trypanosomes. We hypothesize that additional genetic loci were simultaneously selected that protect against renal injury from the major coding risk alleles, and that the protective effect of these loci may have diminished after admixture with Europeans. Here, we will perform a genome-wide screen for polymorphisms that may protect against or exacerbate APOL1 variant-induced renal injury. We will identify proteins that bind differentially to wild type and coding variant ApoL1, as these binding partners may modulate injury caused by the risk variants. Aim 3: Identify biochemical modifiers of APOL1-mediated renal disease. ApoL1 kidney disease risk variants may be most deleterious in the setting of additional risk factors. Here, we explore how two important factors may interact with APOL1 genotype to cause renal disease. Vitamin D is believed to be protective against renal injury, while certain lipid profiles may promote injury. We ask whether these molecules alter APOL1 biology in vitro, and whether biochemical levels of these mediators predict which individuals with the APOL1 risk genotype are likely to develop kidney disease.  8. Project Narrative We have recently found that specific genetic variants in the APOL1 gene account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We now want to understand the factors that combine with the high risk APOL1 genotype to cause overt kidney disease. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number of people with this serious public health problem and for reducing the very large disparity in the rates of kidney disease.",APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease,8791543,R01MD007092,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' In Vitro ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' United States ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Yeasts ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Renal glomerular syndrome ', ' Renal glomerular disorder ', ' Renal glomerular disease or syndrome ', ' Renal Glomerular Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Glomerular disease ', ' Renal glomerular disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Penetrance ', ' American ', ' Yeast One/Two-Hybrid System ', ' Yeast One Hybrid System ', ' Two Hybrid ', ' yeast two hybrid system ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Other Genetics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' protective effect ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' gain of function ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,435000,0.05601613153438291
"Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for kidney transplantation continues to exceed the supply. Increasing the number of living kidney donors is a major priority. Historically, living donors were healthy and free of isolated medical abnormalities (IMA) at the time of donation. Recently, general US population demographics have changed, and in response, transplant centers now include donors with IMAs such as pre-hypertension (pre-HTN), obesity, and metabolic syndrome. At a general population level, individuals with IMAs, particularly African Americans (AA), are more likely to develop comorbidities, such as diabetes, HTN, and chronic kidney disease. Recent data suggest that AA living kidney donors are more likely to have a pre-donation IMA. It remains unclear what impact, if any, living donation will have on development of these comorbidities, and whether racial disparities in risk attributable to donation exist. Current methods for assessing living donor long-term health risks are imprecise, relying heavily on traditional factors such as family and social histories. Morphometric measures (e.g. vascular calcifications; fat distribution), using radiologic imaging, have emerged as strong predictors of cardiovascular risk. Pre-donation imaging, routinely acquired during donor evaluations to assess renal anatomy, can be leveraged to identify novel morphometric risk predictors for post-donation comorbidities. I hypothesize that morphometric measures will greatly improve prediction of post-donation comorbidities, including risk directly attributable to donation. Given significant knowledge gaps in risk prediction and stratification of donors with IMAs, I propose an ancillary study that will leverage data from an ongoing R01-funded cohort study of live donors to create the largest cohort of IMA donors studied and will address unique aims: (1) explore the association of novel morphometric measures and traditional risk factors with post-donation comorbidity stratified by race; (2) develop a risk tool for predicting post-donation comorbidities; and (3) estimate risk attributable to living kidney donation. Utilization o novel morphometric measures obtained from routine pre- donation imaging is innovative, highly practical, and will create a level of risk prediction of living donor outcomes that currently does not exist. Precise risk prediction will improve informed consent, donor autonomy in medical decision making, and will change the practice of live kidney donor selection in the US. Resources and infrastructure at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, including the most AA living kidney donors in the US, are keenly in-line with the proposed aims, and will provide the necessary foundation to see the proposed project to its successful completion. The mentored award will foster my growth as an independent investigator by affording me opportunities to focus on building an expertise in novel risk prediction research and enhancing my exposure to health disparities and chronic disease epidemiology in minority populations. This additional training will inform my path toward long-term career goals of research independence as a surgeon-scientist and R01 funding.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the demand for kidneys continues to exceed the supply, transplant centers have begun to relax selection criteria to include living donors with obesity and/or high blood pressure. Expansion of selection criteria has occurred despite a paucity of supporting safety data. It is critical to balance increasing live donation for transplant candidate against the responsibility of understanding long-term risks specific to donors at the extremes of current selection criteria for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care.        ",Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities,8966934,K23DK103918,"['Alabama ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Award ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Informed Consent ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Event-Free Survival ', ' Disease-Free Survival ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Vascular calcification ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Categories ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Stratification ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' prehypertension ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2015,180977,0.1640769313831251
"Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. organ donation system is in a perpetual state of crisis. Over 115,000 patients are waiting for transplants while the waitlist increases by several thousand annually despite over 6,500 dying and 3,500 becoming too sick to receive a transplant. Black men are disproportionally affected by this crisis, due to higher prevalence of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes and inadequate access to treatment, leading to the highest prevalence of end-stage renal disease and a greater need for kidney transplantation. While Blacks comprise only 13 percent of the total U.S. population, they comprise 34 percent of the 93,000 patients waiting for kidney transplants. Black men comprise 19 percent of the waitlist compared to black women comprising 15 percent, indicating a gender disparity as well. Federally supported interventions have increased the number of black donors such that rates are now proportional to their population percentages, but they remain well below the disproportionate need since organs best match when donors and recipients are of similar race. In this application, we will investigate means for improving organ donor registration among black men using educational video programming produced and distributed in partnership with our network of black owned barbershops in NYC. We will use entertainment education videos and determine how content produced for different audiences (generic multicultural, targeted for black men in our barbershops, and tailored for single viewers based on their prior organ donation beliefs) influences organ donor registration. Our application is a 3- phase qualitative and quantitative research design that includes an intervention development phase using digital video interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos (Aim 1); a 3 arm randomized controlled trial phase, in which customers will be randomized to receive the generic, targeted, or tailored video programming delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mailed in application (Aim 2); and a failure analysis whereby we will interview some of the participants from the randomized trial who registered and failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain the influence of the programming (Aim 3). Future studies will involve modifying this video programming based on findings from this research to promote organ donation in black owned barbershops through passive messaging with generic or targeted videos shown on large screen TVs, or with tailored programs using interactive kiosks. Through this work, we hope to reduce organ transplantation disparities through increased registration among black men who comprise a group having a disproportionally greater need for kidney transplants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will lead to increased organ donor registration among black men who visit black owned barbershops and improve understanding as to what video education strategies are best for encouraging organ donor registration in this setting. We have previously shown with our cardiovascular health promotion and cancer prevention research that, as a stage for influential peers, black owned barbershops constitute an existing and unique community setting and peer network that can be utilized to promote healthy behavior for black men. This research meets specific goals of Healthy People 2020 including, ""Decreasing disparities and measuring access to care for diverse populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and older adults"" and its agenda advocating use of targeted and tailored interventions for improving health among disadvantaged communities.",Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men,8881168,R01DK099639,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Altruism ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Visitors to Patients ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' single-blind trial ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Organ Donations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' motivational intervention ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,368663,0.100978125428191
"Chronic Kidney Disease Knowledge and Awareness among American Indians DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. The overarching goal of this K23 award is to provide Dr. Stacey Jolly, an Alaska Native academic general internist, with the training, research skills, experience, and professional development to establish an independent program of chronic kidney disease-related research. Her proposed training program consists of three core components: (1) community based and translational research principles; (2) qualitative methods and survey design; and, (3) methodology, implementation, and evaluation of prospective clinical trials. She has proposed formal coursework, tutorials, and practical experience for each of the components. She will learn about and incorporate community based and translational research principles. She will develop new analytic skills in the area of qualitative and mixed methods research. She will learn how to translate rich qualitative data into quantitative approaches, specifically survey development. She will learn how to create culturally and content appropriate chronic kidney disease educational materials in the form of computerized digital stories made by American Indians. She will test this inventive modality in a pilot interventional trial with the aim of increasing chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness and chronic kidney disease protective behaviors among American Indians, as well as assessing feasibility acceptability, and effect size. At the completion, she will be well suited to obtain independent research funding. Her career will advance not only as a physician researcher but in academic medicine as well moving from the Assistant to Associate Professor level. Environment. The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, and its affiliate Case Western Reserve University are the major education and research facilities in Cleveland, OH. Dr. Jolly is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. She will benefit from a rich, multidisciplinary mentorship and training environment, which includes experts in nephrology, qualitative methods, public health, epidemiology, biostatistics, and health disparities research. Dr. Ashwini Sehgal is a Professor of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University and Principal Investigator of the Case Center for Reducing Health Disparities will serve as Dr. Jolly's primary mentor. Dr. Spero Manson is a Professor of Medicine at University of Colorado Denver and Principal Investigator of the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health will serve as a co-mentor. Dr. Cheryl Killion is an Associate Professor of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University and qualitative methods expert will serve as a co-mentor. Dr. Jolly brings together a diverse mentorship team, consultants, and advisory committee members that offer extensive research experience, especially among American Indians, and support of her career development program. The site of her research project and data collection will be in South Dakota in which she will work closely with the Strong Heart Study Dakota Center run by Marcia O'Leary of Missouri Breaks Research Industries, Inc. The Strong Heart Study is a well established NIH/NHLBI funded study. Research Project. The goal of this project is to assess chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness among American Indians in the Northern Plains who have metabolic syndrome. Prior work among the general population and some minority populations adversely affected by chronic kidney disease has shown low knowledge and awareness of the condition. To our knowledge, no study has examined in detail chronic kidney disease knowledge, awareness, and beliefs among American Indians. This study proposes to conduct a series of focus groups and create a chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness survey. Few educational intervention clinical trials have been conducted among those at risk for or with early chronic kidney disease. To our knowledge none have used digital storytelling as a means to deliver the educational messaged and have been conducted among American Indians, a group with high prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease.    The aims of the research project are to:   1) Quantify levels of chronic kidney disease knowledge and awareness among American Indians with metabolic syndrome.    2) Determine the effectiveness of a culturally tailored health presentation with computerized digital stories made by American Indians compared to a conventional health video presentation only for improving chronic kidney disease knowledge and factors thought to be preventative of chronic kidney disease or its progression at baseline and follow-up in a pilot clinical intervention trial.    In summary, with this K23 award, Dr. Jolly will be able to focus the majority of her time and effort on career development and research to acquire the advanced training and receive the critical mentorship needed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is a chronic medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and a public health problem. Chronic kidney disease can lead to kidneys failing and needing to be on a dialysis kidney machine or have a kidney transplant. It seems a lot of people do not know they have chronic kidney disease or are at risk for getting chronic kidney disease.

"Myeloablative T- Replete Haploidentical PBSCT for Patients Without MRD or MUD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many patients, particularly those from ethnic minorities, are unable to access the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation due to the lack of a suitable donor. For such patients, umbilical cord blood can offer an alternative source of hematopoietic cells. However, adults typically require the concurrent use of two cord blood units (DCBT) at considerable expense. In adults such transplants are also associated with delayed immune reconstitution, increased rate of infections and a higher treatment related mortality than transplants from conventional donors. Recently the use of haploidentical (partially matched related donor) hematopoietic cell transplants (haplo-HCT) using T-cell-replete marrow grafts and post- transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have been shown to produce high rates of engraftment and low treatment related mortality (TRM) when used with a non-myeloablative preparative regimen, in patients who lack conventional donors. However, such transplants have limited efficacy in aggressive/advanced myeloid malignancies because of a high relapse rate. In an institutional pilot trial, we have assessed the use of T- replete mobilized peripheral blood (PBSC) and a myeloablative preparative regimen with haplo-HCT + PTCy. Despite the advanced and high-risk nature of the malignancies treated, estimated 6 month TRM was 14% and disease-free survival was 72%. All patients engrafted and developed full donor chimerism in CD3+ and CD33+ cells by day +30. A multi-institutional phase II trial is therefore proposed within the BMT CTN to confirm these encouraging results. The proposed trial will test the hypothesis that this novel approach to myeloablative haplo-HCT is safe and effective when used in a multi-institutional setting. Upon successful completion of this phase II trial, a randomized phase 111 comparison is proposed between this approach to haplo-HCT and myeloablative DCBT. The objective of this phase 111 study will be to directly compare these two approaches to alternative donor transplantation with respect to safety, toxicity, efficacy, cost and immune reconstitution. This trial would definitively determine the best option for myeloablative transplantation in patients with advanced malionancies who lack a matched-sibling or matched unrelated donor RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed research addresses a significant current deficiency in public health. Specifically, it tests a novel strategy that will enable curative myeloablative blood stem cell transplants in patients (particularly those from underserved minorities) who are currently unable to access them due to lack of a conventional donor. If successful, it will transform the standard-of-care by offering life-saving therapy to patients who would have died from their cancer and close a major disparity in healthcare access for ethnic minorities.

"Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mid-Career Investigator Award in ""Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD"" by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Associate Professor-in-Residence of Medicine, Pediatrics and Epidemiology at UCLA Schools of Medicine & Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several UCLA related campuses including Harbor-UCLA and Charles-Drew University. These centers provide care to underserved and indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis to survive. African Americans and Hispanics are vastly overrepresented by 3.6 and 1.5 times greater than non-Hispanic Whites, respectively, among US dialysis patients. Whereas the 5-year survival of dialysis patients is <35%, with the highest mortality among malnourished patients, minorities exhibit lower dialysis mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival disparities and their link to nutritional status and dietary barriers can have major clinical and public health implications. PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race; whereas 2 alternative hypotheses related to bone-and-mineral disorders and psychosocial and coping status will also be examined. PI proposes a 5-year patient-oriented, prospective study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,050 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African Americans & 1/3 Hispanics), in collaboration with Southern California DaVita dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status & quality of life will be assessed longitudinally. Clinical events and survival will be followed, and specimens for ongoing and future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed at GCRC. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be develop- ed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 100,000 HD patients. This K24 award with proposed cohort study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue and expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator of training of new investigators in the fields of CKD nutrition & disparities by continuing his liaison with faculty across several campuses, schools and departments within UCLA system including Depts. of Medicine and Pediatrics, Charles-Drew Univ., and UCLA Public Health. (2) Continue and expand his credible efforts in increasing the availability of research participation to minority populations with CKD in Southern California; and (3) Continue to develop a relatively new area of CKD disparity and nutrition research specifically through continued support of the DaVita Clinical Research both in Southern California and across the nation by examining the cohort of Southern dialysis patients and national dialysis cohorts. The data collected and hypotheses generated throughout this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to power additional clinical studies by early career investigators and mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve on patient care. Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their relationship to nutritional status, diet and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to developing more effective strategies to improve outcomes in dialysis population, other 20 million Americans with CKD, and another 30 to 40 million people who suffer from chronic disease states and wasting disorders including chronic heart failure, chronic lung or liver diseases, terminal malignancy, AIDS, advanced age, and other conditions with cachexia. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important plans.","Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in

"A regionally coordinated intervention to reduce racial disparities in access to k DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation (KTx) among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of KTx is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to KTx are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the KTx process. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to use community- based participatory research approaches to develop, test, and disseminate sustainable, community interventions improve access to KTx for AA ESRD patients. In this planning grant, our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. To determine the patient-, dialysis facility-, and neighborhood-level barriers to KTx in ESRD Network 6. Specific Aim 2: To develop a multilevel intervention to reduce racial disparities in access to KTx. Specific Aim 3: To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a pilot intervention to reduce disparities in KTx access in GA. The long-term impact of this application will be to reduce racial disparities in the kidney disease community. RELEVANCE: The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of KTx is the lowest in the nation. The proposed study seeks to leverage an existing academic-community collaboration with the Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition to identify barriers to KTx and to plan, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention targeting ESRD patients and dialysis facility staff.",A regionally coordinated intervention to reduce racial disparities in access to k,8777890,R24MD008077,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitalization ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' North Carolina ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patient advocacy ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Social Workers ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Collaborations ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' patient advocacy group ', ' post intervention ', ' community intervention ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Population ', ' quality improvement organization ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volunteer ', ' community based participatory research ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2015,292924,0.04629798121398058
"Health Literacy in Hispanics with Chronic Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 for Dr. Claudia Lora, who proposes the first systematic examination of health literacy in Hispanics with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This award will allow Dr. Lora the resources and protected time to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming a successful, independent patient-oriented researcher focusing on health care disparities in Hispanics with CKD. While Hispanics currently comprise 15% of the population, they are projected to comprise a quarter of the US population by 2050, Hispanics with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, a better understanding of the factors contributing to the progression of CKD in Hispanics is critical for reducing health disparities and developing therapeutic interventions. Health literacy is known to be associated with health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been well studied in the context of CKD. The potential for health literacy to affect patients' chronic disease management has been recognized by the Institute of Medicine, which in 2004, issued a call to action for research in health literac. Examining health literacy in Hispanics is of utmost importance because minorities and non-English speakers are more likely to have low functional health literacy than non-Hispanic whites. Low health literacy likely contributes to poor health outcomes in Hispanics with CKD through various mechanisms including disease knowledge, access to health care, and health behaviors. By understanding the relationship between health literacy and CKD, we may identify a therapeutic target in CKD progression. In view of the disproportionate burden of kidney disease in Hispanics, the proposed study will examine health literacy in a cohort of Hispanics with CKD. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) To examine health literacy as a predictor for progression of kidney disease in Hispanics with CKD; 2) To examine health literacy as a predictor for cardiovascular events and progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in Hispanics with CKD; and 3) To develop and field test a culturally sensitive, low-literacy, touch tablet application to improve knowledge of hypertension in Hispanics with CKD. The project contains novel concepts and strategies, and will result in the development of a new therapeutic intervention that could improve the health of Hispanics with CKD. The strengths of the proposal are the comprehensive career development plan, the experience and commitment of the mentoring team, and the strong institutional resources and support. In addition, the proposed research is innovative, addresses a growing public health problem, leverages the infrastructure of an ongoing NIH-funded cohort study, and will allow the applicant to gain the skills and experience needed to develop into an independent patient-oriented researcher. Health literacy is known to influence health behaviors and outcomes, but has not been studied in Hispanics with predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). In view of the disproportionate burden of CKD in U.S. Hispanics, the mentored research has two overarching goals: 1) To examine health literacy as a predictor of CKD progression and cardiovascular outcomes in Hispanics with CKD and 2) To develop and pilot a low- literacy, touch tablet application to improve knowledge of hypertension in Hispanics with CKD, which will serve as the basis for a future R01 proposal. The proposed study will advance my research skills towards developing into an independent investigator and the knowledge gained has the potential to advance concepts that drive the field and thereby minimize health disparities in Hispanics with CKD.",Health Literacy in Hispanics with Chronic Kidney Disease,8827761,K23DK091313,"['Action Research ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Language ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Event ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' novel ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' therapeutic target ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,K23,2015,143628,0.03700381626849288
"Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. organ donation system is in a perpetual state of crisis. Over 115,000 patients are waiting for transplants while the waitlist increases by several thousand annually despite over 6,500 dying and 3,500 becoming too sick to receive a transplant. Black men are disproportionally affected by this crisis, due to higher prevalence of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes and inadequate access to treatment, leading to the highest prevalence of end-stage renal disease and a greater need for kidney transplantation. While Blacks comprise only 13 percent of the total U.S. population, they comprise 34 percent of the 93,000 patients waiting for kidney transplants. Black men comprise 19 percent of the waitlist compared to black women comprising 15 percent, indicating a gender disparity as well. Federally supported interventions have increased the number of black donors such that rates are now proportional to their population percentages, but they remain well below the disproportionate need since organs best match when donors and recipients are of similar race. In this application, we will investigate means for improving organ donor registration among black men using educational video programming produced and distributed in partnership with our network of black owned barbershops in NYC. We will use entertainment education videos and determine how content produced for different audiences (generic multicultural, targeted for black men in our barbershops, and tailored for single viewers based on their prior organ donation beliefs) influences organ donor registration. Our application is a 3- phase qualitative and quantitative research design that includes an intervention development phase using digital video interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos (Aim 1); a 3 arm randomized controlled trial phase, in which customers will be randomized to receive the generic, targeted, or tailored video programming delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mailed in application (Aim 2); and a failure analysis whereby we will interview some of the participants from the randomized trial who registered and failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain the influence of the programming (Aim 3). Future studies will involve modifying this video programming based on findings from this research to promote organ donation in black owned barbershops through passive messaging with generic or targeted videos shown on large screen TVs, or with tailored programs using interactive kiosks. Through this work, we hope to reduce organ transplantation disparities through increased registration among black men who comprise a group having a disproportionally greater need for kidney transplants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will lead to increased organ donor registration among black men who visit black owned barbershops and improve understanding as to what video education strategies are best for encouraging organ donor registration in this setting. We have previously shown with our cardiovascular health promotion and cancer prevention research that, as a stage for influential peers, black owned barbershops constitute an existing and unique community setting and peer network that can be utilized to promote healthy behavior for black men. This research meets specific goals of Healthy People 2020 including, ""Decreasing disparities and measuring access to care for diverse populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and older adults"" and its agenda advocating use of targeted and tailored interventions for improving health among disadvantaged communities.",Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men,9109715,R01DK099639,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Altruism ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Visitors to Patients ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' single-blind trial ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Organ Donations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Behavioral ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' motivational intervention ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,77699,0.100978125428191
"Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities ae disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. The factors responsible for this disparity are complex and incompletely understood. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing number of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient- Oriented Research provides a unique mechanism to assist established investigators to attract and retain talented new physician-scientists to careers in patient-oriented research. The candidate for this K24 is James Lash, MD, an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Lash's research focuses on the epidemiology of CKD with a particular emphasis on minority populations. He has considerable experience as a patient- oriented researcher and is the Principal Investigator for two NIDDK-sponsored studies: 1) the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study and 2) the Hispanic CRIC Study. These studies, as well as several other multicenter collaborative studies, provide a wealth of opportunities for trainees. Dr. Lash has developed a solid track record for mentoring young investigators, including a significant number from minority backgrounds. The new research program funded by this award is a natural extension of Dr. Lash's ongoing work and will provide additional opportunities for trainees. It consists of two projects which focus on potential factors contributing to disparities in adults and children with CKD: 1) individual/neighborhood socioeconomic status, and 2) health literacy. This proposed research leverages the infrastructure of two large ongoing cohort studies (the CRIC Study and Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study) and therefore, provides a unique opportunity to examine these factors in both children and adults with CKD. In addition to mentored research, trainees will participate in didactic training through the UIC K30 Clinical Research Training Program and have access to the extensive resources and infrastructure provided by the UIC Center for Clinical Translational Science (CCTS), the UIC School of Public Health, and the UIC P60 Center for Excellence in Health Disparities. This K24 award will provide Dr. Lash with the additional time and resources to amplify his efforts in contributing to our understanding of health disparities in CKD and in training new physician scientists to become independent investigators in kidney disease research.

"Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those on dialysis, have a substantially higher prevalence of hypothyroidism (HT) compared to their non-CKD counterparts. In the general population, HT is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, presumably due to atherosclerosis, platelet activation and thrombosis, and coronary heart disease (CHD) events. CKD patients have an exceedingly high CV mortality, with many of these fatalities related to CHD. However, little is known about the prognostic implications of HT on the CV health and survival of CKD patients.  Dr. Connie Rhee is a nephrologist at the University of California Irvine (UCI) with a strong commitment to the fields of endo-nephrology and drug comparative effectiveness in CKD. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator with a specific focus on thyroid functional disorders in kidney disease. The support of the K23 award will allow Dr. Rhee to achieve the following objectives: 1) investigate the impact of HT and its treatment on CHD risk and survival in CKD patients; 2) gain practical experience in the execution of patient-oriented research; 3) develop proficiency in navigating innovative multidisciplinary collaborations in nephrology, endocrinology, cardiovascular disease, and human subjects research; 4) and acquire expertise in advanced epidemiologic and biostatistical methods.  In order to accomplish these objectives, Dr. Rhee will first examine the longitudinal impact of HT on mortality in a well-characterized prospective hemodialysis (HD) cohort in whom thyroid function will be rigorously defined using a combination of novel and traditional assays (Aim 1). She will then examine the association between HT and 3 specific CV surrogate endpoints (endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification, and platelet activation) that represent major pathogenic mechanisms contributing to CHD risk in CKD (Aim 2). Lastly, she will examine the degree to which the association of HT with mortality is modified by underlying renal function in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients, and if these associations are ameliorated by thyroid hormone treatment using advanced analytic techniques (marginal structural modeling) that improve causal inference (Aim 3). Dr. Rhee will efficiently leverage resources from the NIDDK-sponsored ""Malnutrition, Diet, and Racial Disparities in CKD"" multicenter study and the unique strengths of the NIDDK-sponsored national Veterans Affairs (VA) database as she implements these Specific Aims. Findings from this proposed research will have the potential to uncover HT as a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse CV outcomes in CKD; improve the diagnostic approach and management of this highly prevalent endocrine-renal disorder; and reduce the excess burden of CV death in this vulnerable population. Dr. Rhee will be closely guided by her primary mentor, Dr. Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at UCI whose vast experience in patient-oriented research will be complemented by Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary co-mentor and collaborator team: 1) Dr. Gregory Brent, Professor, Chair of Medicine at the Greater Los Angeles VA, and renowned leader in thyroid hormone research; 2) Dr. Danh Nguyen, Professor and Director of the UCI Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit with expertise in the longitudinal evaluation of CV risk factors in dialysis patients; ) Dr. Steven Brunelli, Associate Epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Senior Director of DaVita Clinical Research with extensive experience in causal inference methods; 4) Dr. Csaba Kovesdy, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at the Memphis VA widely known for his research in the national veteran population; and 5) Dr. Matthew Budoff, Professor and Director of Cardiac Computed Tomography at Harbor UCLA with expertise in cardiovascular diagnostic imaging methods. Dr. Rhee will also draw upon the wealth of UCI's research environment, which includes the Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology and the Division of Nephrology; the Institute of Clinical and Translational Science that is home to the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit; UCI's Departments of Epidemiology and Statistics; as well as the broader research enterprise of neighboring University of California campuses. Dr. Rhee's proposed K23 study, mentorship team, career development plan, and collaborative research environment will catalyze her scientific productivity and provide her with a strong foundation as a future independent investigator and leader in endo-nephrology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hypothyroidism is a common complication in chronic kidney disease patients, who represent a sizeable portion of the US population. While hypothyroidism has been associated with an accelerated risk of coronary heart disease and death in the general population, little is known about the impact of hypothyroidism on the exceedingly high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease patients. This study will investigate 1) whether hypothyroidism magnifies the risk of coronary heart disease and mortality in patients with varying degrees of impaired kidney function, and 2) the role of thyroid hormone treatment in reducing hypothyroid-related death risk in chronic kidney disease, which will advance our understanding of whether hypothyroidism is a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in this vulnerable population.","Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease",8915166,K23DK102903,"['epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Complication ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypothyroidism ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Laboratories ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Kidney disease mechanisms associated with human genetic variation  Chronic kidney disease (CKD), like many complex disease phenotypes, reflects dependent interactions between genetic susceptibilities and environmental factors. APOL1 variants explain much of the excess risk of advanced non-diabetic CKD in patients of African ancestry. However, only some patients with risk genotypes develop kidney disease, suggesting that genetic epistasis or environmental stress is required to trigger variant APOL1-dependent kidney injury. To investigate how APOL1 variants result in CKD, we have focused on HIV- associated nephropathy (HIVAN), the disease most robustly associated with APOL1 risk haplotypes and clearly dependent on an environmental factor, HIV-1 infection. Our preliminary data demonstrate APOL1 is expressed in the podocyte, and APOL1 overexpression activates autophagy. Although mTor-dependent suppression of core autophagy may cause diabetic glomerulopathy, a renal pathology not associated with APOL1 variants, we provide evidence that the genetic association of APOL1 with CKD results from APOL1- dependent regulation of distinct, selective autophagy pathways, which result in the destruction of pathogens. We hypothesize that APOL1 is an autophagic adaptor that tethers a docking SNARE (VAMP8) displayed on lysosomes to the autophagosomal protein LC3-II. The tethering function of APOL1 is activated by binding a triggering molecule, the HIV protein Nef, and results in the selective degradation of autophagosomes carrying HIV viral particles and proteins. Variant APOL1 proteins are functionally defective, permitting HIV to persist in the infected cell and continue synthesis of viral proteins including Nef. Nef blocks autophagic elimination of the virus and is critical for development of HIVAN. Our proposed experiments address three unanswered and novel questions regarding APOL1 function in CKD. Is APOL1 synthesized in situ in kidney and what is its subcellular home? Does circulating or renal-expressed variant APOL1 mediate kidney disease? Does dysregulation of autophagy pathways activated in response to specific environmental stresses result in kidney disease in patients with APOL1 risk genotypes? These questions are addressed with the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine APOL1 expression and intracellular location in normal kidney, and determine if APOL1 localization varies with risk genotype and/or disease diagnosis; 2. Generate in vivo models for the study of APOL1 function; 3. Characterize protein interactions between APOL1 with VAMP8 and the HIV protein Nef and examine normal and variant APOL1 regulation of autophagy in cell lines and cultured podocytes. These studies can result in novel, mechanism-based therapies, improve health disparities in African American patients and identify novel mechanisms of human CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 26 million Americans have evidence for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and more than 570,000 patients have kidney failure (end-stage renal disease [ESRD]). Health care for ESRD patients, who comprise less than 1% of Medicare recipients, accounts for 7% of Medicare expenditures, approximately $30 billion. ESRD patients are at risk for accelerated cardiovascular disease and early death. African American CKD patients in the United States are four times more likely than white patients to progress to ESRD, and a single genetic susceptibility locus (APOL1) explains much of this increased risk. This project's goal is to define biological reasons for the association of APOL1 with CKD in patients with African ancestry in order to improve health disparities in this high-risk population.

"Gender Disparities and Vascular Function in Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is Ana C. Ricardo, MD, MPH, a nephrologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Ricardo's short-term goals are to gain experience and develop skills by conducting research focused on gender disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the contribution of gender differences in endothelial function to these disparities. Her long-term career goals are to become an independent investigator conducting research focused on reducing health inequalities in CKD through lifestyle interventions. To achieve her goals, Dr. Ricardo has assembled a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentored research and didactic coursework at the UIC School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's strong team of mentors and collaborators includes world-class experts with longstanding NIH funding and extensive mentorship experience. Her primary mentor, James P. Lash, MD, is an expert in the epidemiology of CKD in minority populations; Martha L. Daviglus, MD, PhD, her co-mentor, has expertise in the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. The proposal also includes a multidisciplinary team of collaborators with expertise in the areas of women's health, longitudinal data analyses, and the influence of exercise on vascular function. Dr. Ricardo's successful development into an independent physician-scientist will be facilitated by the extensive facilities and resources available at UIC which include the Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Center for Research on Women and Gender, and the School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's research will advance her skills in both primary data collection and longitudinal data analyses. The proposal leverages the infrastructure of the NIH- funded Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, a large and diverse observational study of adults with CKD. Evidence suggests that there are significant gender-related disparities in CKD. Whereas data from the United States Renal Data System indicate that men have 1.5 times greater incidence of end-stage renal disease, a higher prevalence of CKD in women was seen in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Several studies suggest that men have more rapid CKD progression, but this has not been a consistent finding. Furthermore, previous studies were not designed to address this question and included few racial/ethnic minorities. In the general population, there is evidence that differential rates of cardiovascular outcomes in women and men may be related to gender differences in endothelial function, which have been in part attributed to the protective effect of estrogen in women. Moreover, limited data suggest that endothelial dysfunction may be a predictor of CKD progression. However, the contribution of endothelial function to gender disparities in CKD progression is not known. This is an area of significance because studies of non-CKD populations suggest that endothelial function may be improved with pharmacologic therapy (e.g., ACE- inhibitors) or lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise). The specific aims for the proposed project are to 1) Examine gender disparities in kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in the CRIC Study; 2) Examine gender differences in endothelial function and the role of endothelial function as a predictor of CKD progression in 150 University of Illinois CRIC Study participants; and 3) Evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week pilot resistance exercise training intervention and its effect on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This Career Development Award will provide the foundation for Dr. Ricardo to pursue an independent research career dedicated to reducing health disparities in CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem in the U.S. and evidence suggests that outcomes are different for men and women with CKD. The aims of this proposal are to 1) Identify modifiable factors responsible for gender disparities in CKD outcomes; 2) Evaluate the impact of vascular function on gender disparities in CKD progression; and 3) Conduct a pilot study evaluating the effect of resistance exercise on vascular function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This research will fill important gaps in our knowledge and potentially lead to the development of targeted interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with CKD.",Gender Disparities and Vascular

"TAILORED COMPUTER EDUCATION TO INCREASE LIVING DONATION IN AFRICAN-AMERICANS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney transplantation offers patients in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 3 to 17 additional years of life and improved quality-of-life compared to remaining on dialysis. Because of the deceased donor organ shortage, more kidney patients are choosing to receive kidneys from family and friends, a process called living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Although African-Americans are 3.7 times more likely to develop ESRD, they are less likely to receive LDKTs. Therefore, this project will assess whether racial disparities in transplant knowledge, readiness to pursue LDKT, completion of transplant medical evaluation, and receipt of LDKTs can be reduced when ESRD patients receive access to personalized coaching and individually-tailored feedback using an Explore Transplant computerized Expert System. This multilevel study will also examine how other known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT impact the Expert System's effectiveness. ESRD patients presenting for transplant medical evaluation at Barnes-Jewish Transplant Center in St. Louis, Missouri (465 African-Americans, 465 Whites) will be stratified by race and randomized to one of two education conditions (Explore Transplant Expert System vs. Standard Education Control). As they complete transplant medical evaluation, patients in the Expert System condition will receive individually tailored feedback reports and personalized coaching addressing variables important to behavior change and associated with LDKT health disparities. Control patients will only receive standard-of-care education provided by the transplant center. Changes in key outcomes will be assessed at four time points (2-months before in-hospital evaluation day (IHED) (baseline), 2- and 6-months post-IHED, and 18-months post-baseline). The grant has four aims:  Aim 1 (Primary): Compared to the Control Group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System increase in their LDKT readiness and transplant knowledge 6-months post-IHED.  Aim 2: Compared to the Control group, to determine whether African-American and White patients receiving the Expert System are more likely to complete transplant medical evaluation and pursue LDKT 18- months post-baseline.  Aim 3: To examine whether the Expert System's effectiveness in changing LDKT decision-making and behavior is equivalent between African-Americans and Whites.  Aim 4: To examine how known patient, family, and healthcare system barriers to LDKT act alone and in combination with the Expert System to affect African-Americans' decision-making and behavior.  At the conclusion of the study, we will have developed an innovative and cost-effective Explore Transplant Expert System that could be utilized by providers in 5,000 dialysis and 250 transplant centers to tailor LDKT discussion and education based on the needs of individual patients of different races. Patients with kidney failure have better health and quality-of-life when they receive a transplant, especially a transplant from a living donor (LDKT). Although kidney failure disproportionately affects African-Americans, Whites are more likely to receive LDKTs. This randomized controlled trial of 930 African-American and White patients will develop and assess the effectiveness of individually tailored, computer-generated education using an Expert System for overcoming specific barriers affecting African-Americans' pursuit of LDKT.",TAILORED COMPUTER EDUCATION TO INCREASE LIVING DONATION IN AFRICAN-AMERICANS,8920549,R01DK088711,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Health Insurance ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Missouri ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Printing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Friends ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Jewish ', ' follower of religion Jewish ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Oral ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Reporting ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' computer generated ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,452980,0.11949069508729836
"Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for kidney failure is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which provides an average of 10 additional years of life compared to staying on chronic dialysis. Unfortunately, large racial/ethnic disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics comprise over 58 percent of all dialysis patients but receive less than 28 percent of LDKTs. A little-studied and likely crucial cause of LDKT disparities is the lower likelihood that Black and Hispanic donor volunteers (persons interested in donating a live kidney) will complete the multi-step donor evaluation and actually donate. While minority donor volunteers are more likely to have medical contraindications to donation, they are also much more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation or decline participation in paired exchange (programs that permit LDKT using immunologically incompatible donor-recipient pairs). Based upon limited prior research, the outcomes of the donor evaluation may be especially affected by several potentially modifiable individual and health care system factors, such as donor volunteers' motivation to donate, health literacy, knowledge/education about donation, satisfaction with the patient care experience, and socioeconomic barriers to donation. These factors, however, have not been prospectively examined in a well-powered, multi-center, and diverse cohort of donor volunteers. The objective of this study is to determine how differences in modifiable individual and system factors are associated with Black and Hispanic donor volunteers' lower likelihood of actually donating. Our overall hypothesis is that donor volunteers who are Black or Hispanic are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, due to modifiable differences that either (1) are already present at the start of the evaluation, o (2) arise later in the evaluation process. To test this hypothesis, we propose a sequential mixed methods study. First, we will perform qualitative interviews of donor volunteers who previously discontinued their donor evaluations, to identify all the potentially modifiable causes of discontinuation of the donor evaluation (Aim 1). Then, in the quantitative component, we will perform a prospective cohort study of 2,800 live kidney donor volunteers at two large transplant centers in New Jersey and California. Among 575 Black, 875 Hispanic, and 1,350 White donor volunteers, we will determine differences in potentially modifiable factors that are present at the start of the donor evaluation (Aim 2) or arise during the evaluation (Aim 3), and also determine the impact of modifiable factors upon successful completion of the donor evaluation (Aim 4) and actual donation, directly or via paired exchange (Aim 5). At the end of this study, we will understand how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their potentially modifiable social, behavioral, and health services characteristics and how these factors impact both completion of the evaluation and actual donation. Our results, generalizable to the 230+ kidney transplant centers in the U.S., will enable us to design future interventions to improve the education, support, and care of live donor volunteers, to ultimately decrease racial/ethnic disparities in LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For patients with kidney failure, the best treatment option is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but Blacks and Hispanics with kidney failure are much less likely to receive LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics may receive fewer LDKTs because their live donor volunteers are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, possibly due to modifiable reasons. This study will examine how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their motivation, education, perceptions of care, and socioeconomic barriers to donation, and how these potentially modifiable factors impact whether donor volunteers successfully complete evaluation and actually donate.",Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation,8890201,R01MD007664,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Saints ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' volunteer ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,ST.

"CKD-Targeted Analyses of the Jackson Heart Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects over 26 million Americans. Racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence and incidence of CKD. For example, nationally representative data demonstrate that 19.4% of all African Americans have CKD stage 3 or above, and the most recent data on endstage renal disease (ESRD) indicate African Americans have the highest prevalence and incidence of ESRD in the United States. Unique social, cultural, and behavioral characteristics as well as novel biologic risk factors may contribute to the development and progression of CKD in African Americans, but these pathways have not been adequately defined. The goal of the current grant application is to develop a chronic kidney disease (CKD) working group to evaluate CKD and CKD risk factors among the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohorts, to assess risk factors for the progression of CKD and development of endstage renal disease (ESRD), and to determine the influence of CKD on development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Although much is known regarding disparities in the incidence of ESRD, less is known regarding the contribution of differences in novel biologic, behavioral, and social/cultural risk factors to the development of CKD in African Americans. JHS will provide a NIH-funded cohort with which to study the association of CKD and CVD outcomes and death among a population of African Americans. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1: Develop infrastructure for a highly-functioning diverse, national CKD working group for the Jackson Heart Study with expertise in health disparities, epidemiology, and biostatistics; Aim 2: Examine the association of novel and traditional risk factors for CKD, progression of CKD, and ESRD in the JHS cohort. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationship of CKD with traditional CVD risk factors, intermediate cardiac outcomes, incident CVD and death in the JHS cohort.  This research will develop 1) the infrastructure for a successful productive CKD working group, 2) a research agenda that will elucidate determinants of development, progression and outcomes of CKD in the JHS and 3) a future workforce capable of conducting high quality research on the interrelationship of CKD and CVD, thereby improving the public health of African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE STATEMENT Background and Rationale: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an important public health problem due its high prevalence, morbidity, and poor health outcomes. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected with CKD and currently, African Americans have the highest incidence of kidney failure in the world and are less likely to be transplanted. Identification of reversible risk factors early in the course of disease would help to identify and target patients who are at high risk for potential interventions. This application will develop the infrastructure or a national Jackson Heart Study CKD working group that will evaluate novel and non-traditional risk factors for CKD. To that end the specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop infrastructure for a highly-functioning diverse, national CKD working group for the Jackson Heart Study with expertise in health disparities, epidemiology, and biostatistics; Aim 2: Examine the association of novel and traditional risk factors for CKD, progression of CKD, and ESRD in the JHS cohort. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationship of CKD with traditional CVD risk factors, intermediate cardiac outcomes, incident CVD and death in the JHS cohort.

"Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but large racial disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. In 2009, Blacks, who comprised 36.9% of the dialysis population, received 32.4% of deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKTs) but just 13.7% of LDKTs. A multi- component intervention that addresses the many barriers that impede LDKT (e.g. transplant candidates' lack of knowledge about LDKT; fears regarding donor's future health; guilt; and discomfort with discussing LDKT) could plausibly increase LDKT among Blacks. Our main objective is to test an educational and behavioral intervention that is designed to increase receipt of LDKT among newly-listed transplant candidates who are Black. We hypothesize that a multi-component intervention will increase both readiness to pursue LDKT and actual receipt of LDKTs among Blacks. We propose a parallel group, two-arm randomized trial among 500 Black kidney transplant candidates. After Blacks are placed on the waiting list for a DDKT, we will randomly assign them to either: (1) a control group that will receive Usual Care, or (2) an Intervention group that will receive a culturally sensitive, group-based intervention. Participants randomized to the Intervention will be asked to attend a 60-90 minute small group seminar (family and friends strongly encouraged to attend) that will feature brief talks regarding: basic facts about CKD, transplant, and the waiting list; basic facts about live kidney donation; the experience of receiving a transplant and LDKT; the experience of serving as a live kidney donor; and skill-building regarding how to ask for a live donor. These talks will directly address the barriers that impede LDKT. Physicians and Black LDKT recipients and live donors will lead these talks, supplemented by educational videos. In our preparatory aim, we will develop the Intervention and train the speakers. Our primary aim will compare LDKT readiness and LDKT receipt in the Intervention vs. Usual Care groups of our randomized clinical trial; our primary outcome is change in readiness to pursue LDKT, and our main secondary outcome is actual receipt of LDKT, after 18 months of follow-up. Our secondary aims will determine (a) the social and behavioral variables that modify the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt; and (b) whether changes in social and behavioral factors mediate the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. This clinical trial will occur at two neighboring transplant centers that share the same policies, procedures, and personnel. In an average year, these two centers combine to place over 200 Blacks on the DDKT waiting list and perform over 135 LDKTs (including ~29 among Blacks). By intervening upon patients ""distal"" in the transplant process, at two centers that perform many LDKTs, we have excellent power to detect a beneficial effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. At the end of this study, we will have developed and tested a culturally sensitive educational and behavioral Intervention that has the potential to increase receipt of LDKT among Blacks and decrease the striking racial disparities in receipt of LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blacks with kidney failure are much less likely to receive a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which is usually the best treatment for kidney failure. We propose a randomized clinical trial to test an intervention consisting of practical but potent educational seminars that will feature video-based modules and ""live"" talks by physicians, LDKT recipients, and live donors. Among 500 kidney transplant candidates who are Black and newly activated on the transplant waiting list, our trial will determine whether this Intervention (compared to Usual Care) increases readiness for and receipt of LDKT.",Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist,8926399,R01DK098744,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Guilt ', ' Health ', ' Israel ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Friends ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Policies ', ' Saints ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' volunteer ', ' stem ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,ST.

"Impact of Cardiovascular Risk Control on Racial Disparities in Kidney Transplant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the applicant is to become an independent investigator who designs and executes studies to optimize medication utilization in kidney transplant patients, with the specific goals of reducing racial disparities in graft surviva. Black renal transplant recipients are at significantly higher risk for graft loss following kidney transplant due, in part, to well recognized immunologic hyper-responsiveness, poorer socioeconomic status and more severe comorbid conditions. Much of the previous interventions to reduce disparities in Black recipients have focused on improving access to transplant and reducing immunologic risks; yet the differences in graft survival rates between Black and non-Black kidney transplant patients have not significantly improved. To date, little attention has been directed towards improving CVD risk factor control as a potential approach to reduce racial disparities in kidney transplant. The proposed research plan will seek to test the hypothesis that CVD risk factor control significantly influences racial disparities in kidney transplant outcomes through a two phase study. Phase 1: a large-scale longitudinal cohort study conducted using national datasets (VA, CMS, and USRDS) that critically analyzes the modifying impact of CVD risk factor control on racial disparities among kidney transplants. Phase 2: The C-DRIFT trial (Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Control in Kidney Transplant) is a prospective study to explore the feasibility and potential effectiveness of pharmacist-led patient-level interventions directed at improving CVD risk factor control as a mechanism to reduce racial disparities in kidney transplant recipients. Completing these studies will provide novel and compelling preliminary data, so that by the conclusion of this award, a grant proposal will be submitted to conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial powered to test the hypothesis that optimizing CVD risk factor control will improve graft survival and racial disparities in kidney transplant patients. Additionally and equally as important, the completion of this grant will provide the applicant invaluable training and mentoring that will allow him to develop the skillset necessary to become an independently funded investigator. The proposed career development plan capitalizes on the rich interdisciplinary collaborative environment, the unique patient population, and the comprehensive didactic coursework available at the Medical University of South Carolina. The primary mentor and co-mentors on this application are highly experienced and well-funded researchers that have expertise in conducting research in racial disparities, kidney transplant and CVD interventional studies. Thus, at the conclusion of this award, novel data regarding the impact of CVD risk factor control on racial disparities in kidney transplant will be produced and disseminated while the applicant develops into a well-trained researcher, capable of conducing relevant patient-oriented research in kidney transplant recipients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited research has been focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor management as a mechanism to minimize inequalities in Black kidney transplant recipients. Pharmacist-led patient-level interventions to improve CVD risk factor control are novel and promising methods to improve outcomes in these high-risk patients. The aims of this grant are to better understand the role of CVD risk factor control on racial disparitis in kidney transplantation, explore promising mechanisms to improve CVD risk factor control while developing the applicant into a well-trained patient-oriented researcher.",Impact of Cardiovascular Risk Control on Racial Disparities in Kidney Transplant,8815305,K23DK099440,"['Attention ', ' Award ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Life ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Improve Access ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' graft function ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' diabetes control ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NIDDK,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K23,2015,166939,0.06584590491772781
"Racial and Cardiovascular Risk Factor Anomalies in CKD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving maintenance dialysis therapy the proportion of African American patients is significantly higher compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts, and traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and obesity show seemingly anomalous, inverse associations with adverse outcomes. The exceptionally high prevalence of end- stage renal disease (ESRD) among African Americans is likely a result of the complex interaction of their higher rates of CKD incidence and/or faster CKD progression, lower mortality, and lower likelihood of kidney transplantation. The anomalous cardiovascular risk factor profile in ESRD could be the result of short-term competing risks related to malnutrition and inflammation, with the seemingly unfavorable traditional cardiovascular risk factors associating with a better nutritional state, which could differentially affect African Americans an hence provide one explanation for their better survival in ESRD. Whether similar paradoxical differences in mortality rates in non-dialysis dependent CKD stages exist is not clear; their presence, extent, the CKD stage of its occurrence and their mechanisms of action all need to be clarified in sufficient detail to allow for the design of proper diagnostic and interventional strategies towards cardiovascular risk reduction and towards alleviating racial disparities in outcomes. In the spirit of PA-09-196 we will utilize data obtained from the national VA research database which is the only large administrative database with detailed socio-demographic and clinical information on very large numbers of individuals (over 4 million individuals including ove 0.5 million with CKD) across all parts of the US. We will examine the population-wide dynamic effects of incident CKD and mortality on racial composition and on changes in cardiovascular risk factor profiles by examining longitudinally a cohort of patients with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate. We will explore the effects of various socio-demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, biochemical measurements and medication use on mortality and progressive CKD using complex epidemiologic methods including joint modeling to assess the effect of longitudinal changes in risk factor parameters on mortality and marginal structural models in order to adjust for both baseline and time-dependent confounders. This three-year project will generate a wealth of information to more reliably examine the above hypotheses related to racial and cardiovascular discrepancies in the outcomes of patients with all levels of kidney function that could have significant public health implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CKD is a prototype for a chronic disease state and is recognized as a global epidemic and a Healthy People 2020 priority area. It is also now recognized as a CVD risk factor and most studies suggest the presence of CKD is a more powerful predictor of CV events than all traditional CV risk factors with the possible exceptions of diabetes and hypertension. Advancing our understanding of the changes in mortality risk profile from normal eGFR to advancing stages of CKD will yield invaluable insights into socio-cultural, clinical and biologic influences on mortality risk and how they interact during the development of a chronic disease state. Given the role of chronic diseases on both the personal and financial burden to our nation, this study is designed to enhance our understanding of chronic disease prevention and early intervention, and ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.",Racial and Cardiovascular Risk Factor Anomalies in CKD,8811934,R01DK096920,"['Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anemia ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' bone ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Evolution ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Minerals ', ' Structural Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Malnutrition ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' alternative treatment ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2015,300017,0.11064997614576702
"Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney to benefit a loved one or even a stranger, but the long-term consequences of donating a kidney, particularly in African Americans, are poorly understood. In this study, we will study high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and post-donation treatment patterns in largest ever primary cohort of African American donors, Caucasian American donors, matched healthy non-donor controls (who were cleared for donation but did not ultimately donate because of recipient factors), and other matched healthy individuals (who participated in large cohort studies and were deemed healthy enough to have likely passed a donor evaluation). Our findings will influence the practice of live kidney donation in the United States, particularly among African Americans, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care.",Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans,8977945,R01DK096008,"['Anemia ', ' bone disorder ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medical Records ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Minerals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' Living Donors ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' Agreement ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' loved ones ', ' population based ', ' data registry ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' prehypertension ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,129600,0.17693976748080628
"Evaluation of Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation in New National Kidney Allocation Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The public health burden of kidney failure in the United States is substantial, with more than 600,000 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. There are two main treatments for kidney disease - dialysis or kidney transplantation. A complex, multi-tiered national system regulates kidney disease care, reimbursement, and transplantation, creating barriers to overcoming the significant racial disparities that exist in transplantation, the most effective treatment for ESRD. The federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network of the United Network for Organ Sharing oversees the allocation of all deceased donor organs in the US, and on Dec. 4, 2014, a major change to the allocation policy was implemented that is expected to impact racial disparities in transplantation access. We propose to study the impact of the natural experiment offered by enactment of this new kidney allocation policy on reducing disparities in the key steps of referral for transplant evaluation, wit listing, and transplantation, each of which have complexities for measurement at the local and national level. In addition, to impact disparities reduction at the service delivery level, we willuse national data to develop and then disseminate a systems-level practice of providing feedback to dialysis centers about their transplant performance to improve overall wait listing rates and decrease disparities in kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the new kidney allocation policy will lead to a reduction in disparities in transplantation at 1 year, we will prospectively examine the impact of the policy changes on racial disparities in the key steps in the transplant process post- vs. pre- allocation: a) referra from the dialysis facility for transplant evaluation in the Southeast, where we have access to this unique data, and b) wait listing and transplantation in the US. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of a systems-level approach to providing tailored transplant performance feedback and education about the kidney allocation policy, we will conduct a multicomponent, clinical effectiveness-implementation study among 750 US dialysis facilities which treat >50,000 dialysis patients. We anticipate that increasing provider knowledge will reduce disparities in transplant wait listing. The long-term impact of this application will be to influence the way organs are allocated in the US to ensure equitability through better analysis of policy and dissemination of best practices at the health systems level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study seeks to examine whether a change in the national kidney allocation policy resulted in a reduction in racial disparities in access to ke steps to kidney transplantation, and to leverage a systems-based approach to conduct a national effectiveness-implementation study of a tailored performance feedback report among US dialysis facilities with racial disparities in transplant wait listing.",Evaluation of Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation in New National Kidney Allocation Policy,9098789,R01MD010290,"['Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Feedback ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methodology ', ' National Health Policy ', ' North Carolina ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' South Carolina ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Wit ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' federal policy ', ' organ allocation ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' underserved minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,529995,0.14107272964431145
"Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those on dialysis, have a substantially higher prevalence of hypothyroidism (HT) compared to their non-CKD counterparts. In the general population, HT is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, presumably due to atherosclerosis, platelet activation and thrombosis, and coronary heart disease (CHD) events. CKD patients have an exceedingly high CV mortality, with many of these fatalities related to CHD. However, little is known about the prognostic implications of HT on the CV health and survival of CKD patients.  Dr. Connie Rhee is a nephrologist at the University of California Irvine (UCI) with a strong commitment to the fields of endo-nephrology and drug comparative effectiveness in CKD. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator with a specific focus on thyroid functional disorders in kidney disease. The support of the K23 award will allow Dr. Rhee to achieve the following objectives: 1) investigate the impact of HT and its treatment on CHD risk and survival in CKD patients; 2) gain practical experience in the execution of patient-oriented research; 3) develop proficiency in navigating innovative multidisciplinary collaborations in nephrology, endocrinology, cardiovascular disease, and human subjects research; 4) and acquire expertise in advanced epidemiologic and biostatistical methods.  In order to accomplish these objectives, Dr. Rhee will first examine the longitudinal impact of HT on mortality in a well-characterized prospective hemodialysis (HD) cohort in whom thyroid function will be rigorously defined using a combination of novel and traditional assays (Aim 1). She will then examine the association between HT and 3 specific CV surrogate endpoints (endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification, and platelet activation) that represent major pathogenic mechanisms contributing to CHD risk in CKD (Aim 2). Lastly, she will examine the degree to which the association of HT with mortality is modified by underlying renal function in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients, and if these associations are ameliorated by thyroid hormone treatment using advanced analytic techniques (marginal structural modeling) that improve causal inference (Aim 3). Dr. Rhee will efficiently leverage resources from the NIDDK-sponsored ""Malnutrition, Diet, and Racial Disparities in CKD"" multicenter study and the unique strengths of the NIDDK-sponsored national Veterans Affairs (VA) database as she implements these Specific Aims. Findings from this proposed research will have the potential to uncover HT as a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse CV outcomes in CKD; improve the diagnostic approach and management of this highly prevalent endocrine-renal disorder; and reduce the excess burden of CV death in this vulnerable population. Dr. Rhee will be closely guided by her primary mentor, Dr. Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at UCI whose vast experience in patient-oriented research will be complemented by Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary co-mentor and collaborator team: 1) Dr. Gregory Brent, Professor, Chair of Medicine at the Greater Los Angeles VA, and renowned leader in thyroid hormone research; 2) Dr. Danh Nguyen, Professor and Director of the UCI Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit with expertise in the longitudinal evaluation of CV risk factors in dialysis patients; 3) Dr. Steven Brunelli, Associate Epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Senior Director of DaVita Clinical Research with extensive experience in causal inference methods; 4) Dr. Csaba Kovesdy, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at the Memphis VA widely known for his research in the national veteran population; and 5) Dr. Matthew Budoff, Professor and Director of Cardiac Computed Tomography at Harbor UCLA with expertise in cardiovascular diagnostic imaging methods. Dr. Rhee will also draw upon the wealth of UCI's research environment, which includes the Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology and the Division of Nephrology; the Institute of Clinical and Translational Science that is home to the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit; UCI's Departments of Epidemiology and Statistics; as well as the broader research enterprise of neighboring University of California campuses. Dr. Rhee's proposed K23 study, mentorship team, career development plan, and collaborative research environment will catalyze her scientific productivity and provide her with a strong foundation as a future independent investigator and leader in endo-nephrology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hypothyroidism is a common complication in chronic kidney disease patients, who represent a sizeable portion of the US population. While hypothyroidism has been associated with an accelerated risk of coronary heart disease and death in the general population, little is known about the impact of hypothyroidism on the exceedingly high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease patients. This study will investigate 1) whether hypothyroidism magnifies the risk of coronary heart disease and mortality in patients with varying degrees of impaired kidney function, and 2) the role of thyroid hormone treatment in reducing hypothyroid-related death risk in chronic kidney disease, which will advance our understanding of whether hypothyroidism is a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in this vulnerable population.","Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease",9054113,K23DK102903,"['epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Complication ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypothyroidism ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Laboratories ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Molecular Mechanism of APOL1 Associated Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop ESRD at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently we showed that coding sequence variants in the ApolipoproteinL1 (ApoL1) gene, present only in individuals with recent African ancestry, explain a very large proportion of this health disparity. This has now been confirmed by multiple additional studies. ApoL1 variants have a major impact on different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and HIV-associated nephropathy. Individuals with two variant ApoL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. 3.5 million African Americans likely have the high risk ApoL1 genotype. African Americans without two variant alleles have minimal excess risk. At present, little is known about the biology of ApoL1 or its rol in the kidney. ApoL1 has a defined role in resistance to trypanosomes, and the G1 and G2 variants appear to have become common in Africa because they confer protection against the forms of trypanosomes that cause African Sleeping Sickness. Here, our goal is to elucidate the function of ApoL1 and its role in causing human kidney disease in order to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this large disparity in kidney disease risk. ApoL1 is a Bcl2 family member with a BH3-only domain, suggesting a possible role in apoptosis. Our initial experiments in oocytes lead us to believe that this pathway may be an important mechanism of glomerular injury in ApoL1-associated disease. We propose to: 1. Define the cell biology and cell physiology of ApoL1: We will define the basic cellular biology of ApoL1 including biosynthesis, trafficking, ion channel properties, endocytosis, and effects on organellar structure and function. We will compare wild type and renal risk variant ApoL1 biology to understand the mechanisms that lead to kidney disease. 2. Examine specific effects of ApoL1 on apoptosis in podocytes: We hypothesize that ApoL1 risk variants promote podocyte apoptosis via a BH3 domain in the N- terminus and that the renal risk variants enhance ApoL1's pro-apoptotic effects. We will test this hypothesis both in cultured podocytes of different ApoL1 genotypes and by transfecting podocytes with ApoL1 constructs designed to probe the underlying apoptotic mechanisms. 3. Use a zebrafish model to study ApoL1- mediated renal injury in vivo: We will use zebrafish to understand how ApoL1 variants promote glomerular injury. We have demonstrated that the G1 risk variant increases embryonic lethality and causes glomerular pathology, and that wild type ApoL1 can reverse the pathologic phenotype caused by G1. We will examine the effects of heterologous ApoL1 expression in a whole organism using ubiquitous and tissue-specific promoters. We will define the risk variant domains that cause disease and the wild type domains that prevent G1-mediated injury. We will also define the specific interactions between the wild-type, G1, and G2 forms of ApoL1 in vivo. Lastly, we will examine the role of ApoL1 variants in promoting or preventing apoptosis of glomerular cells.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently found that specific genetic variants in a single gene, APOL1, account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa.

"Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to transplant are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the transplant process. In 2014, our SEKTx Coalition conducted a randomized, multicomponent intervention (Reducing Disparities In Access to kidNey Transplantation [RaDIANT]) Community Study in GA, the state with the lowest kidney transplant rates in the nation, consisting of patient- and provider-focused educational and engagement interventions designed to increase referral for transplant evaluation among AA ESRD patients. This study was effective in improving referral for kidney transplantation among AA in GA, but efforts to improve access to kidney transplantation must be expanded beyond GA and should include interventions targeting steps beyond referral to the medical evaluation at the transplant center. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to eliminate racial disparities in every step of the kidney transplant process. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine reasons for racial disparities in medical evaluation for kidney transplantation among dialysis patients in GA, NC and SC. Specific Aim 2: Implement the RaDIANT Regional Study in GA, NC, and SC with the goal of increasing rates of referral, medical evaluation, and waitlisting, and reducing disparities in these key steps. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a process and outcome evaluation of the RaDIANT Regional Study interventions. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant access among the AA ESRD population in the Southeast and reduce health disparities in transplantation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of kidney disease is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. The proposed study seeks to leverage an existing academic-community collaboration with the Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention targeting End Stage Renal Disease patients and dialysis facility staff in reducing racial disparities in access t kidney transplantation.        ",Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study,9129349,U01MD010611,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Maintenance ', ' North Carolina ', ' parity ', ' Patient advocacy ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Facility Controls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Population Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' quality improvement organization ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' volunteer ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' surveillance data ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,589402,0.13970851774364518
"Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but large racial disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. In 2009, Blacks, who comprised 36.9% of the dialysis population, received 32.4% of deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKTs) but just 13.7% of LDKTs. A multi- component intervention that addresses the many barriers that impede LDKT (e.g. transplant candidates' lack of knowledge about LDKT; fears regarding donor's future health; guilt; and discomfort with discussing LDKT) could plausibly increase LDKT among Blacks. Our main objective is to test an educational and behavioral intervention that is designed to increase receipt of LDKT among newly-listed transplant candidates who are Black. We hypothesize that a multi-component intervention will increase both readiness to pursue LDKT and actual receipt of LDKTs among Blacks. We propose a parallel group, two-arm randomized trial among 500 Black kidney transplant candidates. After Blacks are placed on the waiting list for a DDKT, we will randomly assign them to either: (1) a control group that will receive Usual Care, or (2) an Intervention group that will receive a culturally sensitive, group-based intervention. Participants randomized to the Intervention will be asked to attend a 60-90 minute small group seminar (family and friends strongly encouraged to attend) that will feature brief talks regarding: basic facts about CKD, transplant, and the waiting list; basic facts about live kidney donation; the experience of receiving a transplant and LDKT; the experience of serving as a live kidney donor; and skill-building regarding how to ask for a live donor. These talks will directly address the barriers that impede LDKT. Physicians and Black LDKT recipients and live donors will lead these talks, supplemented by educational videos. In our preparatory aim, we will develop the Intervention and train the speakers. Our primary aim will compare LDKT readiness and LDKT receipt in the Intervention vs. Usual Care groups of our randomized clinical trial; our primary outcome is change in readiness to pursue LDKT, and our main secondary outcome is actual receipt of LDKT, after 18 months of follow-up. Our secondary aims will determine (a) the social and behavioral variables that modify the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt; and (b) whether changes in social and behavioral factors mediate the effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. This clinical trial will occur at two neighboring transplant centers that share the same policies, procedures, and personnel. In an average year, these two centers combine to place over 200 Blacks on the DDKT waiting list and perform over 135 LDKTs (including ~29 among Blacks). By intervening upon patients ""distal"" in the transplant process, at two centers that perform many LDKTs, we have excellent power to detect a beneficial effect of the Intervention upon LDKT readiness and receipt. At the end of this study, we will have developed and tested a culturally sensitive educational and behavioral Intervention that has the potential to increase receipt of LDKT among Blacks and decrease the striking racial disparities in receipt of LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blacks with kidney failure are much less likely to receive a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which is usually the best treatment for kidney failure. We propose a randomized clinical trial to test an intervention consisting of practical but potent educational seminars that will feature video-based modules and ""live"" talks by physicians, LDKT recipients, and live donors. Among 500 kidney transplant candidates who are Black and newly activated on the transplant waiting list, our trial will determine whether this Intervention (compared to Usual Care) increases readiness for and receipt of LDKT.",Increasing live donor kidney transplant among Blacks on the transplant waitlist,9127936,R01DK098744,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Guilt ', ' Health ', ' Israel ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Friends ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Distal ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Policies ', ' Saints ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' volunteer ', ' stem ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIDDK,ST.

"House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While kidney transplantation is the best treatment option for adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), profound racial and socioeconomic disparities persist. Minorities and low-income patients, for instance, are less likely to receive lve donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), which yields better survival, quality of life, and health care cost outcomes than chronic dialysis or deceased donor transplantation. Guided by a socio- ecological model of LDKT, the PI developed an innovative House Calls intervention that has shown to be effective at overcoming barriers and increasing LDKT rates in Black patients. We now seek to expand the reach and intensity of the House Calls intervention by including other minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and by adding a novel Patient-Centered Decision Support component. Also, little is known about those variables that mediate the intervention's impact on the occurrence of LDKT or whether the intervention can attenuate the growing gender disparity in living donation. In this study, we will pursue three specific aims: (1) evaluate the differential benefit of adding a patient-centered decision support component to the House Calls intervention; (2) identify mediators of the relationship between the interventions and the occurrence of LDKT; and (3) examine whether the House Calls intervention reduces the gender disparity in rates of living kidney donation. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a single-site, randomized controlled trial with a planned enrollment of 100 minority and low income patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Patients will be randomized to receive the House Calls intervention alone (HC) or the House Calls intervention + a web-based Patient-Centered Decision Support intervention (HC+DS). The central hypothesis is that, compared to HC alone, the HC+DS group will have a higher proportion of enrolled patients with LDKT by the 2-yr study endpoint (primary outcome) and higher proportions of enrolled patients with at least one live donor inquiry, at least one live donor evaluation, and in LDKT action (vs. contemplation) stages (secondary outcomes). Also, we will evaluate whether the House Calls intervention (either HC alone or HC+DS) leads to more donor inquiries, evaluations, and actual donations from men, relative to a non-intervention control group, controlling for patient race/ethnicity, gender, age, and household income. By identifying effective interventions for patient populations with historically lower rates of LDKT, we can eliminate many barriers to access, reduce disease burden, and lower mortality rates by producing more donor organs for transplantation. We are especially well-prepared to conduct the proposed research due to the multidisciplinary nature of the research team, as well as the expertise and experience of the team in developing LDKT and living donation educational materials, implementing and evaluating the House Calls intervention, conducting LDKT research with minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, and producing meaningful scientific and clinical outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Certain minorities and low-income patients are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease. While kidney transplantation offers the best option for long-term survival and reduced morbidity, minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged wait longer for kidney transplantation and they are far less likely to receive live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). While educational efforts have helped to expand awareness about the need for and benefits of LDKT, there have been very few attempts to systematically examine strategies for increasing LDKT in minority and low-income patients. The proposed research is innovative because it further evaluates the relative effectiveness of one of the only empirically-supported interventions to reduce racial disparities in LDKT. Specifically, it will expand the reach of the intervention to include more minority groups, low-income patients, and a novel patient-centered decision support component. Findings from this study have the potential to close the health disparity gap by identifying effective educational and interventional strategies that can be used by kidney transplant centers to increase LDKT in minority and low-income patients.",House Calls and Decision Support: Increasing Access to Live Donor Transplantation,9133362,R01DK098727,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Home Visits ', ' House Call ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Low Income Population ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' Living Donors ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' functional status ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Educational Materials ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Study Section ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,261000,0.1441238320891264
"Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for kidney transplantation continues to exceed the supply. Increasing the number of living kidney donors is a major priority. Historically, living donors were healthy and free of isolated medical abnormalities (IMA) at the time of donation. Recently, general US population demographics have changed, and in response, transplant centers now include donors with IMAs such as pre-hypertension (pre-HTN), obesity, and metabolic syndrome. At a general population level, individuals with IMAs, particularly African Americans (AA), are more likely to develop comorbidities, such as diabetes, HTN, and chronic kidney disease. Recent data suggest that AA living kidney donors are more likely to have a pre-donation IMA. It remains unclear what impact, if any, living donation will have on development of these comorbidities, and whether racial disparities in risk attributable to donation exist. Current methods for assessing living donor long-term health risks are imprecise, relying heavily on traditional factors such as family and social histories. Morphometric measures (e.g. vascular calcifications; fat distribution), using radiologic imaging, have emerged as strong predictors of cardiovascular risk. Pre-donation imaging, routinely acquired during donor evaluations to assess renal anatomy, can be leveraged to identify novel morphometric risk predictors for post-donation comorbidities. I hypothesize that morphometric measures will greatly improve prediction of post-donation comorbidities, including risk directly attributable to donation. Given significant knowledge gaps in risk prediction and stratification of donors with IMAs, I propose an ancillary study that will leverage data from an ongoing R01-funded cohort study of live donors to create the largest cohort of IMA donors studied and will address unique aims: (1) explore the association of novel morphometric measures and traditional risk factors with post-donation comorbidity stratified by race; (2) develop a risk tool for predicting post-donation comorbidities; and (3) estimate risk attributable to living kidney donation. Utilization o novel morphometric measures obtained from routine pre- donation imaging is innovative, highly practical, and will create a level of risk prediction of living donor outcomes that currently does not exist. Precise risk prediction will improve informed consent, donor autonomy in medical decision making, and will change the practice of live kidney donor selection in the US. Resources and infrastructure at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, including the most AA living kidney donors in the US, are keenly in-line with the proposed aims, and will provide the necessary foundation to see the proposed project to its successful completion. The mentored award will foster my growth as an independent investigator by affording me opportunities to focus on building an expertise in novel risk prediction research and enhancing my exposure to health disparities and chronic disease epidemiology in minority populations. This additional training will inform my path toward long-term career goals of research independence as a surgeon-scientist and R01 funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the demand for kidneys continues to exceed the supply, transplant centers have begun to relax selection criteria to include living donors with obesity and/or high blood pressure. Expansion of selection criteria has occurred despite a paucity of supporting safety data. It is critical to balance increasing live donation for transplant candidate against the responsibility of understanding long-term risks specific to donors at the extremes of current selection criteria for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care.",Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities,9110989,K23DK103918,"['Alabama ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Award ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Informed Consent ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Event-Free Survival ', ' Disease-Free Survival ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Vascular calcification ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Categories ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Stratification ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' prehypertension ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictive tools ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2016,179533,0.1640769313831251
"Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are less likely to become registered organ donors. In addition, although first-person consent laws have been passed in 48 states, hospitals remain reluctant to harvest organs without the consent of the registered donor's family. Epidemiologic studies on African Americans have focused on the willingness to donate organs. Little research has been done on the positive decision-making process of becoming a registered organ donor. Objectives: The goal of this project is to identify facilitators associated with becoming a registered organ donor and providing familial notification. We hypothesize that positive outcome expectations (physical, social, and self-evaluative) will be associated with increased African American organ donor registration. We also hypothesize that increased perceived self-efficacy (PSE) will be associated with increased familial notification. Design and Methods: Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a guiding framework, a qualitative study involving focus groups will be performed and then validated by large-scale quantitative telephone surveys. African Americans, age 19 and older, who made a decision regarding organ donation at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past 3 months will be stratified into those who chose to become a registered organ donor and those who declined. The dependent variables for analysis will be 1) becoming a registered organ donor and 2) family notification of the decision to become a registered organ donor. Significance: The study will identify the key factors that drive African Americans to become registered organ donors and the determinants of familial notification. This data will inform future interventions to increase African American donor registration and develop mechanisms to ensure family consent, thereby reducing disparities in organ donation and improving the health outcomes of African Americans. African Americans who registered at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past three months will be stratified into those who chose to be an organ donor and those who declined. A qualitative study involving focus groups and validated by quantitative surveys will be performed to determine the factors associated with the decision of African Americans to become registered organ donors and to inform their families of their donation wishes.",Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent,9060308,K23DK091514,"['Age ', ' Alabama ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Belief ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disincentive ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Organ Donations ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' Reaction ', ' Visit ', ' Organ Harvestings ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' population based ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2016,147088,0.09349268344638881
"Patient Oriented Research in Kidney Disease and Transplant Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 600,000 adults in the US suffer from ESRD. For the appropriate patients, kidney transplantation (KT) reduces mortality, improves quality of life, and saves substantial Medicare dollars. However, selecting patients for KT can be challenging, particularly among certain subgroups such as older adults, and current metrics are of limited utility in informing clinical decision-making. Furthermore, once selected for KT, patients face similar challenges when considering deceased donor offers or deciding if to allow friends or family to put themselves at risk as living donors. Predicting which patients would benefit from KT, and optimally matching them to the right donor, is one of the most critical concerns for patients, transplant physicians, and referring nephrologists. This is a proposal for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award for Dorry Segev, MD, PhD, an Associate Professor of Surgery and Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Segev leads three major R01-funded patient- oriented research efforts to address the challenges of ESRD and KT clinical decision-making: (1) A prospective study of frailty and risk prediction among older dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients; (2) A retrospective study of long-term outcomes and survival benefit from incompatible live donor kidney transplantation; and (3) A multi-center longitudinal study of long-term sequelae of kidney donation.

"Kidney disease mechanisms associated with human genetic variation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD), like many complex disease phenotypes, reflects dependent interactions between genetic susceptibilities and environmental factors. APOL1 variants explain much of the excess risk of advanced non-diabetic CKD in patients of African ancestry. However, only some patients with risk genotypes develop kidney disease, suggesting that genetic epistasis or environmental stress is required to trigger variant APOL1-dependent kidney injury. To investigate how APOL1 variants result in CKD, we have focused on HIV- associated nephropathy (HIVAN), the disease most robustly associated with APOL1 risk haplotypes and clearly dependent on an environmental factor, HIV-1 infection. Our preliminary data demonstrate APOL1 is expressed in the podocyte, and APOL1 overexpression activates autophagy. Although mTor-dependent suppression of core autophagy may cause diabetic glomerulopathy, a renal pathology not associated with APOL1 variants, we provide evidence that the genetic association of APOL1 with CKD results from APOL1- dependent regulation of distinct, selective autophagy pathways, which result in the destruction of pathogens. We hypothesize that APOL1 is an autophagic adaptor that tethers a docking SNARE (VAMP8) displayed on lysosomes to the autophagosomal protein LC3-II. The tethering function of APOL1 is activated by binding a triggering molecule, the HIV protein Nef, and results in the selective degradation of autophagosomes carrying HIV viral particles and proteins. Variant APOL1 proteins are functionally defective, permitting HIV to persist in the infected cell and continue synthesis of viral proteins including Nef. Nef blocks autophagic elimination of the virus and is critical for development of HIVAN. Our proposed experiments address three unanswered and novel questions regarding APOL1 function in CKD. Is APOL1 synthesized in situ in kidney and what is its subcellular home? Does circulating or renal-expressed variant APOL1 mediate kidney disease? Does dysregulation of autophagy pathways activated in response to specific environmental stresses result in kidney disease in patients with APOL1 risk genotypes? These questions are addressed with the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine APOL1 expression and intracellular location in normal kidney, and determine if APOL1 localization varies with risk genotype and/or disease diagnosis; 2. Generate in vivo models for the study of APOL1 function; 3. Characterize protein interactions between APOL1 with VAMP8 and the HIV protein Nef and examine normal and variant APOL1 regulation of autophagy in cell lines and cultured podocytes. These studies can result in novel, mechanism-based therapies, improve health disparities in African American patients and identify novel mechanisms of human CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 26 million Americans have evidence for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and more than 570,000 patients have kidney failure (end-stage renal disease [ESRD]). Health care for ESRD patients, who comprise less than 1% of Medicare recipients, accounts for 7% of Medicare expenditures, approximately $30 billion. ESRD patients are at risk for accelerated cardiovascular disease and early death. African American CKD patients in the United States are four times more likely than white patients to progress to ESRD, and a single genetic susceptibility locus (APOL1) explains much of this increased risk. This project's goal is to define biological reasons for the association of APOL1 with CKD in patients with African ancestry in order to improve health disparities in this high-risk population.",Kidney

"MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CKD Project Summary  The purpose of the renewal of this mid-career investigator award titled, “Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD (MADRAD)” by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics and Public Health at the University California Irvine School of Medicine and UCLA School of Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research endeavors with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several University of California and Veterans Affairs-affiliated campuses in Southern California. These centers provide care to underserved, indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis for survival. In the US, African Americans and Hispanics have a substantially higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (3.5 and 1.5 times higher, respectively) than non-Hispanic Whites. While the overall 5-year survival of ESRD patients is less than 40%, with the highest mortality risk observed among malnourished patients, minority dialysis patients exhibit lower mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival differences and the contribution of nutritional status and dietary factors to these disparities may have major clinical and public health implications.  The PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race/ethnicity. Several alternative hypotheses related to racial/ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms, bone and mineral disorders, mental health and psychosocial factors, and dialysis treatment characteristics will also be examined. The PI proposes a 5-year prospective patient-oriented research study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,500 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African American and 1/3 Hispanic), in collaboration with Southern California dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status, quality of life, clinical events, and survival will be longitudinally assessed. Genetic factors such as APOL1 risk alleles will also be examined, and biospecimens for future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects, additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be developed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 150,000 HD patients.  The support of the K24 award for this prospective study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue to expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator for early-career investigators in renal nutrition and CKD disparities by leveraging his networking relationships across several campuses and centers including the University of California system and its Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Kaiser Permanente of Southern Calif., UCLA Public Health, and LA and Orange County Health Departments; (2) continue to expand his persistent efforts in increasing the participation of minority populations in CKD research studies across Southern California; and (3) continue his cultivation of an innovative area of CKD disparities and nutrition research through promising early career investigators and the ongoing support of collaborators in Southern California. The data and hypotheses generated during this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to promote additional patient-oriented studies by mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Relevance of Research to Public Health  Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and their relationship with nutritional status, diet, genetic factors, and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to the development of more effective strategies to improve the survival and quality of life of dialysis patients, an additional 20 million CKD patients, and an additional 30 to 40 million Americans who suffer from chronic disease states associated with wasting disorders such as chronic heart failure. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important objectives.","MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CKD",9243542,K24DK091419,"['Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Body Composition ', ' bone ', ' California ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fibroblast Growth Regulatory Factor ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Gene Family ', ' FGF ', ' Endothelial Cell Growth Factor ', ' DNA Synthesis Factor ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Indigent ', ' Inflammation ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Assessment ', ' Nutrition Assessment ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perception ', ' Platelet Activation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteins ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' thyroid disorder ', ' Thyroid Gland Disorder ', ' Thyroid Gland Disease ', ' Thyroid Diseases ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Caring ', ' Malnutrition ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' wasting ', ' African ', ' muscle mass ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle form ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Figs ', ' Figs -

"The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD ABSTRACT: Racial inequalities in kidney and end stage renal diseases (ESRD) have been well-documented and are independent of lower socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education), lower access to care, or other conventional risk factors. Research has identified numerous genetic risk factors of renal disease, particularly the APOL1 variants occurring in persons of African descent. However, these genetic factors primarily increase susceptibility, requiring other factors for the development of disease. A growing body of research indicates the importance of neighborhoods for health and health inequalities. Unequal neighborhood contexts may be an important and largely unexplored determinant of the increased kidney disease risk experienced by Blacks compared to Whites. In fact, neighborhood context may interact with genetic susceptibility to result in kidney disease inequalities. Clarifying the role of neighborhood is important as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring. They develop and change through policies and are thus amenable to intervention. Despite the evidence indicating the importance of neighborhoods for the major risk factors and determinants of kidney disease, there is a dearth of empirical research on the role of neighborhoods in relation to kidney disease itself, particularly at pre-ESRD stages. The primary challenges to research in this area are: (a) the lack of skilled researchers with training in both social science and the pathophysiology and genetic science of kidney disease; and (b) the paucity of datasets that contain high quality neighborhood and clinical and genetic measures. To reach my long-term career goal to become a successful, independent researcher who clarifies the social causes and genetic and biomedical mechanisms of racial CKD inequalities, I will address the current scientific challenges through the proposed training and research, respectively by: (a) complementing my early work in the biological sciences and extensive training in the social sciences with extensive training in the pathophysiology and genetics of kidney disease; and (b) creating state-of-the-art neighborhood measures to existing datasets with high quality repeat clinical measures of renal function and damage. I will address three career goals:  1. To obtain formal training in renal physiology and pathophysiology.  2. To develop expertise in genetic epidemiology and population genetics pertaining to racial inequalities in  kidney disease.  3. To take the first step toward independence through an R01 submission. My training will include mentorship and collaboration with leading experts in the genetics and pathophysiology of CKD inequalities, formal coursework in genetic epidemiology, statistical/population genetics, and renal physiology/pathophysiology, and multiple conferences and workshops on the substantive topics of genetics, race, and CKD and on professional development. Through my research project, I will use three cohorts (Health and Retirement Study, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network) to examine the interactive associations between multiple measures of four neighborhood domains (racial residential segregation, social environment, built environment, and health care resources) and genetic risk (APOL1 and β-globin HBB genotypes, adjusting for genetic ancestry), as follows:  Aim 1: Link state-of-the-art measures of four domains of neighborhood context to population-representative,  epidemiological, and clinical cohort datasets containing markers of kidney disease.  Aim 2: Examine longitudinal associations between neighborhood context and renal health, with adjustment  for genetic ancestry and APOL1 genotype.  Aim 3: Examine the modifying role of neighborhood context on longitudinal associations between APOL1  high-risk genotype status and renal health. With this training and dataset creation, I will then clarify the neighborhood characteristics that are most tightly linked to renal outcomes both directly and through their interactions with genetic risk loci. This research will set a solid foundation for research on neighborhood characteristics and inequalities in kidney disease. Not only will this research clarify the interdependent roles of neighborhood and genetic risk on these inequalities, but it will identify key neighborhood characteristics, which are amenable to change, related to kidney disease within and between racial groups. UM is the ideal venue for my training and research as it is internationally recognized as a leading research institution that strongly supports interdisciplinary science. I joined the faculty both at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) because of its commitment to interdisciplinary research, and Nephrology because of its commitment to clarifying the social exposures that contribute to kidney disease. Within ISR, the Nephrology Division, and School of Public Health, I will acquire rigorous training and develop solid collaborations devoted to the clarification of the social and genetic causes of racial inequalities in CKD. NARRATIVE: Racial inequalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been well-documented but are not well-understood. Recent research suggests an important role for genetics such as the high risk variants of the gene, APOL1, encoding the apolipoprotein L1, present only in persons of African descent. However, research also points to neighborhoods as an important source of health inequalities and clarifying its role is critical as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring and are amenable to change. In fact, it may be that neighborhood environments may result in CKD through their interaction with genetic susceptibility. Using three complementary cohorts, I will examine the interactive effects between specific neighborhood characteristics and APOL1 on longitudinal measures of CKD.",The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD,9179800,K01DK106322,"['Apolipoproteins ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' β-globin ', ' B-globin ', ' beta Globin ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Censuses ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Science of genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Mentorship ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nephrotic Syndrome ', ' Physiology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' African ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Staging ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' built environment ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2016,154860,0.03983428540338788
"Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for kidney failure is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which provides an average of 10 additional years of life compared to staying on chronic dialysis. Unfortunately, large racial/ethnic disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics comprise over 58 percent of all dialysis patients but receive less than 28 percent of LDKTs. A little-studied and likely crucial cause of LDKT disparities is the lower likelihood that Black and Hispanic donor volunteers (persons interested in donating a live kidney) will complete the multi-step donor evaluation and actually donate. While minority donor volunteers are more likely to have medical contraindications to donation, they are also much more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation or decline participation in paired exchange (programs that permit LDKT using immunologically incompatible donor-recipient pairs). Based upon limited prior research, the outcomes of the donor evaluation may be especially affected by several potentially modifiable individual and health care system factors, such as donor volunteers' motivation to donate, health literacy, knowledge/education about donation, satisfaction with the patient care experience, and socioeconomic barriers to donation. These factors, however, have not been prospectively examined in a well-powered, multi-center, and diverse cohort of donor volunteers. The objective of this study is to determine how differences in modifiable individual and system factors are associated with Black and Hispanic donor volunteers' lower likelihood of actually donating. Our overall hypothesis is that donor volunteers who are Black or Hispanic are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, due to modifiable differences that either (1) are already present at the start of the evaluation, o (2) arise later in the evaluation process. To test this hypothesis, we propose a sequential mixed methods study. First, we will perform qualitative interviews of donor volunteers who previously discontinued their donor evaluations, to identify all the potentially modifiable causes of discontinuation of the donor evaluation (Aim 1). Then, in the quantitative component, we will perform a prospective cohort study of 2,800 live kidney donor volunteers at two large transplant centers in New Jersey and California. Among 575 Black, 875 Hispanic, and 1,350 White donor volunteers, we will determine differences in potentially modifiable factors that are present at the start of the donor evaluation (Aim 2) or arise during the evaluation (Aim 3), and also determine the impact of modifiable factors upon successful completion of the donor evaluation (Aim 4) and actual donation, directly or via paired exchange (Aim 5). At the end of this study, we will understand how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their potentially modifiable social, behavioral, and health services characteristics and how these factors impact both completion of the evaluation and actual donation. Our results, generalizable to the 230+ kidney transplant centers in the U.S., will enable us to design future interventions to improve the education, support, and care of live donor volunteers, to ultimately decrease racial/ethnic disparities in LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For patients with kidney failure, the best treatment option is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but Blacks and Hispanics with kidney failure are much less likely to receive LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics may receive fewer LDKTs because their live donor volunteers are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, possibly due to modifiable reasons. This study will examine how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their motivation, education, perceptions of care, and socioeconomic barriers to donation, and how these potentially modifiable factors impact whether donor volunteers successfully complete evaluation and actually donate.",Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation,9032532,R01MD007664,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Saints ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' volunteer ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIMHD,ST.

"Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to transplant are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the transplant process. In 2014, our SEKTx Coalition conducted a randomized, multicomponent intervention (Reducing Disparities In Access to kidNey Transplantation [RaDIANT]) Community Study in GA, the state with the lowest kidney transplant rates in the nation, consisting of patient- and provider-focused educational and engagement interventions designed to increase referral for transplant evaluation among AA ESRD patients. This study was effective in improving referral for kidney transplantation among AA in GA, but efforts to improve access to kidney transplantation must be expanded beyond GA and should include interventions targeting steps beyond referral to the medical evaluation at the transplant center. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to eliminate racial disparities in every step of the kidney transplant process. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine reasons for racial disparities in medical evaluation for kidney transplantation among dialysis patients in GA, NC and SC. Specific Aim 2: Implement the RaDIANT Regional Study in GA, NC, and SC with the goal of increasing rates of referral, medical evaluation, and waitlisting, and reducing disparities in these key steps. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a process and outcome evaluation of the RaDIANT Regional Study interventions. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant access among the AA ESRD population in the Southeast and reduce health disparities in transplantation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of kidney disease is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. The proposed study seeks to leverage an existing academic-community collaboration with the Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention targeting End Stage Renal Disease patients and dialysis facility staff in reducing racial disparities in access t kidney transplantation.",Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study,9351692,U01MD010611,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Maintenance ', ' North Carolina ', ' parity ', ' Patient advocacy ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Facility Controls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Population Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' quality improvement organization ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' volunteer ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' primary outcome ', ' surveillance data ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,27107,0.13970851774364518
"Gender Disparities and Vascular Function in Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is Ana C. Ricardo, MD, MPH, a nephrologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Ricardo's short-term goals are to gain experience and develop skills by conducting research focused on gender disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the contribution of gender differences in endothelial function to these disparities. Her long-term career goals are to become an independent investigator conducting research focused on reducing health inequalities in CKD through lifestyle interventions. To achieve her goals, Dr. Ricardo has assembled a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentored research and didactic coursework at the UIC School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's strong team of mentors and collaborators includes world-class experts with longstanding NIH funding and extensive mentorship experience. Her primary mentor, James P. Lash, MD, is an expert in the epidemiology of CKD in minority populations; Martha L. Daviglus, MD, PhD, her co-mentor, has expertise in the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. The proposal also includes a multidisciplinary team of collaborators with expertise in the areas of women's health, longitudinal data analyses, and the influence of exercise on vascular function. Dr. Ricardo's successful development into an independent physician-scientist will be facilitated by the extensive facilities and resources available at UIC which include the Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Center for Research on Women and Gender, and the School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's research will advance her skills in both primary data collection and longitudinal data analyses. The proposal leverages the infrastructure of the NIH- funded Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, a large and diverse observational study of adults with CKD. Evidence suggests that there are significant gender-related disparities in CKD. Whereas data from the United States Renal Data System indicate that men have 1.5 times greater incidence of end-stage renal disease, a higher prevalence of CKD in women was seen in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Several studies suggest that men have more rapid CKD progression, but this has not been a consistent finding. Furthermore, previous studies were not designed to address this question and included few racial/ethnic minorities. In the general population, there is evidence that differential rates of cardiovascular outcomes in women and men may be related to gender differences in endothelial function, which have been in part attributed to the protective effect of estrogen in women. Moreover, limited data suggest that endothelial dysfunction may be a predictor of CKD progression. However, the contribution of endothelial function to gender disparities in CKD progression is not known. This is an area of significance because studies of non-CKD populations suggest that endothelial function may be improved with pharmacologic therapy (e.g., ACE- inhibitors) or lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise). The specific aims for the proposed project are to 1) Examine gender disparities in kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in the CRIC Study; 2) Examine gender differences in endothelial function and the role of endothelial function as a predictor of CKD progression in 150 University of Illinois CRIC Study participants; and 3) Evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week pilot resistance exercise training intervention and its effect on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This Career Development Award will provide the foundation for Dr. Ricardo to pursue an independent research career dedicated to reducing health disparities in CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem in the U.S. and evidence suggests that outcomes are different for men and women with CKD. The aims of this proposal are to 1) Identify modifiable factors responsible for gender disparities in CKD outcomes; 2) Evaluate the impact of vascular function on gender disparities in CKD progression; and 3) Conduct a pilot study evaluating the effect of resistance exercise on vascular function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This research will fill important gaps in our knowledge and potentially lead to the development of targeted interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with CKD.",Gender Disparities and Vascular

"APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease SUMMARY More than 500,000 Americans suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans develop kidney failure at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Recently, we discovered two coding sequence variants in ApolipoproteinL1 (APOL1) that account for a large proportion of this major health disparity. APOL1 kidney disease variants have a major impact on multiple different types of kidney disease including hypertension-associated ESRD, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Risk inheritance is recessive: individuals with two variant APOL1 alleles have a 7-30 fold increased risk for kidney disease. We predict that more than 3.5 million African Americans have the high risk APOL1 genotype. The presence of two risk alleles does not lead to kidney disease in all individuals, indicating that other genetic and environmental factors are important modifiers. Understanding why some individuals with the high-risk genotype develop kidney disease while others do not will improve risk stratification and may illuminate the pathways most amenable to therapy. We therefore propose to: Aim 1: Identify additional genetic modifiers at the APOL1 gene locus. Our data suggest that APOL1 kidney disease risk variants are gain-of- function alleles. Since not all individuals with two risk alleles develop disease, other local polymorphisms may regulate expression of APOL1, modulating the effect of the disease-causing APOL1 coding mutations. We will define structural variants that may alter APOL1 gene expression, and test their effects on the penetrance of the two disease-causing alleles. We will test whether polymorphisms in transcription factor and microRNA binding sites affect the penetrance of these APOL1 risk alleles. Aim 2: Find epistatic modifiers of APOL1 penetrance. The APOL1 renal risk variants increased in frequency in Africa, at least in part, because they provided protection against trypanosomes. We hypothesize that additional genetic loci were simultaneously selected that protect against renal injury from the major coding risk alleles, and that the protective effect of these loci may have diminished after admixture with Europeans. Here, we will perform a genome-wide screen for polymorphisms that may protect against or exacerbate APOL1 variant-induced renal injury. We will identify proteins that bind differentially to wild type and coding variant ApoL1, as these binding partners may modulate injury caused by the risk variants. Aim 3: Identify biochemical modifiers of APOL1-mediated renal disease. ApoL1 kidney disease risk variants may be most deleterious in the setting of additional risk factors. Here, we explore how two important factors may interact with APOL1 genotype to cause renal disease. Vitamin D is believed to be protective against renal injury, while certain lipid profiles may promote injury. We ask whether these molecules alter APOL1 biology in vitro, and whether biochemical levels of these mediators predict which individuals with the APOL1 risk genotype are likely to develop kidney disease. 8. Project Narrative We have recently found that specific genetic variants in the APOL1 gene account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We now want to understand the factors that combine with the high risk APOL1 genotype to cause overt kidney disease. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number of people with this serious public health problem and for reducing the very large disparity in the rates of kidney disease.",APOL1 variants: Understanding the basis of disparities in rates of kidney disease,9011387,R01MD007092,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Gene Expression ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' In Vitro ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Public Health ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' Trypanosome ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' United States ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Yeasts ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Renal glomerular syndrome ', ' Renal glomerular disorder ', ' Renal glomerular disease or syndrome ', ' Renal Glomerular Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Glomerular disease ', ' Renal glomerular disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Frequencies ', ' Penetrance ', ' American ', ' Yeast One/Two-Hybrid System ', ' Yeast One Hybrid System ', ' Two Hybrid ', ' yeast two hybrid system ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Other Genetics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' protective effect ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' gain of function ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' screening ', ' Genetic study ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,435000,0.05601613153438291
"Metabolomics and Genomics in African Americans with CKD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Two recent discoveries suggest that common, African-specific genetic risk factors are particularly relevant in CKD susceptibility. Variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) and the presence of a single copy of the sickle cell mutation (sickle cell trait, or SCT) both increase the risk of CKD progression. How these variants confer kidney risk, whether there is gene-gene interplay, and the identity of any causal intermediates is unknown. The proposed studies will use two complementary cohorts of African Americans with CKD, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) and a subset of BioMe, to investigate these questions. The AASK study is arguably the most comprehensively phenotyped of African Americans with CKD in the world, assessing participants' kidney function every 6 months for up to 12 years (and up to 17 years for end-stage renal disease and death). BioMe is an ongoing, contemporary cohort of patients receiving medical care in New York City, with substantial resources devoted to biospecimen collection and genotyping. The analysis will build upon our prior work in genetic risk factors for CKD by investigating novel variants and their relationship to kidney function decline as well as gene-gene interplay in risk for adverse CKD outcomes. In addition, we will study the relationship of metabolomic patterns - a snapshot of the end-product of cellular processes - with CKD outcomes. This analysis can lead to identification of novel and potentially modifiable risk factors for CKD outcomes. When combined with genomic data, the metabolomic consequences of genetic risk variants such as the APOL1 high-risk genotype or SCT can be studied. In addition, analytic techniques can help distinguish whether metabolomic risk factors cause adverse CKD outcomes or are simply a byproduct of an associated process. Understanding the relationship between genomics, metabolomics, and outcomes will advance knowledge regarding pathogenic pathways and potentially modifiable targets in CKD progression, particularly in African Americans, an ethnic group disproportionately affected with advanced CKD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Recent studies have identified two African-specific genetic variants which may explain much of the ethnic differences in CKD risk. Understanding gene function, and in particular the metabolomic intermediates which may be targeted by interventions, can provide critical information that will lead to reductions in CKD incidence and progression among African Americans.        ",Metabolomics and Genomics in African Americans with CKD,9080607,R01DK108803,"['Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Bile Acids ', '

"Myeloablative T- Replete Haploidentical PBSCT for Patients Without MRD or MUD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many patients, particularly those from ethnic minorities, are unable to access the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation due to the lack of a suitable donor. For such patients, umbilical cord blood can offer an alternative source of hematopoietic cells. However, adults typically require the concurrent use of two cord blood units (DCBT) at considerable expense. In adults such transplants are also associated with delayed immune reconstitution, increased rate of infections and a higher treatment related mortality than transplants from conventional donors. Recently the use of haploidentical (partially matched related donor) hematopoietic cell transplants (haplo-HCT) using T-cell-replete marrow grafts and post- transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have been shown to produce high rates of engraftment and low treatment related mortality (TRM) when used with a non-myeloablative preparative regimen, in patients who lack conventional donors. However, such transplants have limited efficacy in aggressive/advanced myeloid malignancies because of a high relapse rate. In an institutional pilot trial, we have assessed the use of T- replete mobilized peripheral blood (PBSC) and a myeloablative preparative regimen with haplo-HCT + PTCy. Despite the advanced and high-risk nature of the malignancies treated, estimated 6 month TRM was 14% and disease-free survival was 72%. All patients engrafted and developed full donor chimerism in CD3+ and CD33+ cells by day +30. A multi-institutional phase II trial is therefore proposed within the BMT CTN to confirm these encouraging results. The proposed trial will test the hypothesis that this novel approach to myeloablative haplo-HCT is safe and effective when used in a multi-institutional setting. Upon successful completion of this phase II trial, a randomized phase 111 comparison is proposed between this approach to haplo-HCT and myeloablative DCBT. The objective of this phase 111 study will be to directly compare these two approaches to alternative donor transplantation with respect to safety, toxicity, efficacy, cost and immune reconstitution. This trial would definitively determine the best option for myeloablative transplantation in patients with advanced malionancies who lack a matched-sibling or matched unrelated donor RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed research addresses a significant current deficiency in public health. Specifically, it tests a novel strategy that will enable curative myeloablative blood stem cell transplants in patients (particularly those from underserved minorities) who are currently unable to access them due to lack of a conventional donor. If successful, it will transform the standard-of-care by offering life-saving therapy to patients who would have died from their cancer and close a major disparity in healthcare access for ethnic minorities.

"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort(CRIC) Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the dramatic growth of the Hispanic population with end stage renal disease in the U.S., relatively little is known about earlier stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is based at the University of Illinois at Chicago and is an ancillary study to the NIDDK-sponsored multi-center CRIC Study. During the first two funding periods, the study assembled a sizable cohort of Hispanics with moderate to severe CKD (baseline eGFR ~40 ml/min/1.73m2) and addressed critical questions. One key finding was that compared to non-Hispanics whites, Hispanics with CKD are burdened by lower socioeconomic status, poorer blood pressure control, higher depressive symptoms, and lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We also found that Hispanics with moderate to severe CKD are at higher risk for CKD progression compared to non-Hispanic whites and that this increased risk is not entirely explained by differences in sociodemographic or clinical factors. As a result of our findings, the scientific scope of this competitive renewal has been broadened to address knowledge gaps in the following areas: 1) the epidemiology of mild CKD, 2) the influence of CKD progression on patient-centered outcomes, and 3) the impact of sociocultural/psychosocial factors on outcomes. First, because individuals with mild CKD comprise a much larger proportion of the CKD population, improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors in mild CKD may have substantial public health implications. Recognizing the need to understand mild CKD, the parent CRIC Study recently recruited 1500 additional individuals with eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2. However, only 4% of these participants are Hispanic. Second, there is growing recognition of the need to study outcomes defined by patients as important. Our finding of low HRQOL in Hispanics reinforces the need to study the influence of CKD progression on HRQOL and other patient-centered outcomes. Third, accumulating evidence suggests that sociocultural (e.g., acculturation) and psychosocial (e.g., stress, social support, depression) factors influence health outcomes in Hispanics in the general population but these factors have not been studied in the context of CKD. This application seeks to continue follow-up of the existing Hispanic CRIC cohort and enrich it with recruitment of 125 Hispanics with mild CKD (eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2) to accomplish the following Aims: 1) Evaluate the association of Hispanic ethnicity with risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in adults with mild CKD; 2) Examine the relationship of CKD progression with patient-centered outcomes (e.g., HRQOL, physical function, pain) across the spectrum of CKD severity, among Hispanics and across racial/ethnic groups; and 3) Investigate the association of sociocultural and psychosocial factors with CKD progression among Hispanics across the spectrum of CKD severity. The renewal of Hispanic CRIC and its continued close link to the parent CRIC Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to efficiently address a broad range of critical questions regarding the epidemiology of CKD in Hispanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During the first two funding periods, the Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study has provided important insights about the burden of moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics and its impact on outcomes. The proposed renewal expands the scientific scope of the study by focusing on mild CKD and conducting a rigorous evaluation of sociocultural/psychosocial factors and patient-centered outcomes which are relevant to the Hispanic CKD population.

"Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney to benefit a loved one or even a stranger, but the long-term consequences of donating a kidney, particularly in African Americans, are poorly understood. In this study, we will study high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and post-donation treatment patterns in largest ever primary cohort of African American donors, Caucasian American donors, matched healthy non-donor controls (who were cleared for donation but did not ultimately donate because of recipient factors), and other matched healthy individuals (who participated in large cohort studies and were deemed healthy enough to have likely passed a donor evaluation). Our findings will influence the practice of live kidney donation in the United States, particularly among African Americans, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care.",Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans,9096070,R01DK096008,"['Anemia ', ' bone disorder ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medical Records ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Minerals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' Living Donors ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' Agreement ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' loved ones ', ' population based ', ' data registry ', ' prehypertension ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,657852,0.17693976748080628
"Sugarcane workers, medical visits, and kidney function ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Mesoamerica is a leading killer of workers in agricultural communities. The objective of this proposal is to examine whether symptoms and injuries that sugarcane workers experience may also be adversely impacting kidney function. Heat stress, volume depletion, and muscle injury have been theorized to play a role in developing CKD. Many previous studies of CKD in Mesoamerica are cross-sectional or examine change in kidney function over a relatively short period of time. In the proposed research, we will investigate this issue in a study of 243 sugarcane industry with different jobs. We have available complete work histories for all subjects and medical records with details of each medical visit abstracted. These provide information on whether workers experienced dysuria, exhaustion, muscle injury, or back injury. For Aim 1, we will examine whether medical visits for these reasons occurred disproportionately by job type. In particular, cane cutters are thought to endure the most intense heat and greatest physical exertion. Next, we're interested in whether dysuria, exhaustion, muscle injury, or back injury are more likely to lead to long-term kidney change. For Aim 2, we will evaluate if workers seeking medical care for these reasons experienced a more rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), an indicator of kidney function. Study follow-up covers up to 14 years, and is positioned to make critical contributions to our understanding of factors affecting CKD in afflicted agricultural communities. This work relates closely to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'s Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing Sector. It also aligns with two Cross-Sectors: Cancer, Reproductive, and Cardiovascular Diseases; and Occupational Health Disparities as Hispanic workers disproportionately work in some of the more dangerous jobs. This research aligns with the NIOSH Research to Practice goals because it will identify medical conditions for which intervention can occur prior to development of a chronic condition.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A high prevalence of a distinct form of chronic kidney disease has been reported in Mesoamerica, primarily among agricultural workers, for whom common risk factors (obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) are largely absent. We will examine whether specific types of medical visits (e.g., dysuria, muscle injury, and burns) during their employment vary by job type and whether these medical visits may be associated with a subsequently reduced kidney function. This research may shed light on which medical conditions occurring during agricultural work increase a worker's risk of developing kidney dysfunction and potentially chronic kidney disease.        ","Sugarcane workers, medical visits, and kidney function",9092389,R21OH011120,[''],NIOSH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,216153,0.06448338478835253
"Doctor-Teen Communication & Antihypertensive Adherence in Chronic Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension is one of the most important independent risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. The results of the recently completed ESCAPE trial highlight the importance of blood pressure control as a means to slow CKD progression, making antihypertensive nonadherence a prime target for behavioral intervention. Surprisingly, there is no research on adherence to antihypertensive medication among children either with or without CKD. Physician-adolescent communication is key for facilitating lifelong self-management skills and changes as the adolescent matures and assumes more responsibility for his/her care. However, there is a striking gap in our knowledge of physician-adolescent communication in general and specifically how it impacts regimen adherence and health outcomes. Evaluating how known risk and resilience factors and physician-adolescent communication interact through a comprehensive, longitudinal predictive model of adolescent nonadherence in CKD is an essential prelude to the development of effective, targeted adherence interventions for high-risk patients. The purpose of this study is to test 1) the impact of antihypertensive medication adherence in adolescents on blood pressure control and subsequent progression of CKD; and 2) the influence of physician-adolescent communication on medication adherence over time. This is a prospective study of 150 adolescents age 11-19 years old with CKD (Stages 1-5) who are prescribed an antihypertensive medication. Objective measurement approaches will be used to assess antihypertensive medication adherence (electronic monitoring and pharmacy refills), health outcomes (e.g., ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and biomarkers of CKD progression), and physician-adolescent communication (RIAS coding of nephrology clinic visits). Additionally, the moderating effect of known nonadherence risk and resilience factors on the association between physician-adolescent communication and adherence will be assessed. All variables will be measured at baseline, 12- and 24- months; additionally, adherence and health outcomes will be measured at 6-, 18- and 30-months. Longitudinal analyses will be used to model the change in outcomes with time-varying covariates. This will allow us to evaluate how changes in physician-adolescent communication impact adherence and then subsequent blood pressure control and CKD progression. Further, the lessons learned in this study of adolescents with CKD will add to our understanding of the impact of physician-adolescent communication across chronic illnesses. Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, making antihypertensive nonadherence a prime target for behavioral intervention. Physician-patient communication is key for facilitating lifelong illness management; however, we lack data on how physicians and adolescents communicate and on the impact of their communication on medication adherence. The purpose of this study is: 1) to examine the impact of antihypertensive adherence in adolescents on blood pressure control medication and subsequent progression of CKD; and 2) to assess how physician-adolescent communication influences medication adherence over time and, ultimately, the health of adolescents with CKD.",Doctor-Teen Communication & Antihypertensive Adherence in Chronic Kidney Disease,8847321,R01DK092919,"['Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Organ ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' skills ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' parent monitoring ', ' parental monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' health literacy ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 19 year old ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' hypertension control ', ' Regimen ', ' adolescent health ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' comorbid depression ', ' depression comorbidity ', ' comorbidity with depression ', ' comorbid with depression ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Learning ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,411474,0.07325542261890526
"Community Based Research to Improve Organ Donor Registration among Black Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. organ donation system is in a perpetual state of crisis. Over 115,000 patients are waiting for transplants while the waitlist increases by several thousand annually despite over 6,500 dying and 3,500 becoming too sick to receive a transplant. Black men are disproportionally affected by this crisis, due to higher prevalence of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes and inadequate access to treatment, leading to the highest prevalence of end-stage renal disease and a greater need for kidney transplantation. While Blacks comprise only 13 percent of the total U.S. population, they comprise 34 percent of the 93,000 patients waiting for kidney transplants. Black men comprise 19 percent of the waitlist compared to black women comprising 15 percent, indicating a gender disparity as well. Federally supported interventions have increased the number of black donors such that rates are now proportional to their population percentages, but they remain well below the disproportionate need since organs best match when donors and recipients are of similar race. In this application, we will investigate means for improving organ donor registration among black men using educational video programming produced and distributed in partnership with our network of black owned barbershops in NYC. We will use entertainment education videos and determine how content produced for different audiences (generic multicultural, targeted for black men in our barbershops, and tailored for single viewers based on their prior organ donation beliefs) influences organ donor registration. Our application is a 3- phase qualitative and quantitative research design that includes an intervention development phase using digital video interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos (Aim 1); a 3 arm randomized controlled trial phase, in which customers will be randomized to receive the generic, targeted, or tailored video programming delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mailed in application (Aim 2); and a failure analysis whereby we will interview some of the participants from the randomized trial who registered and failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain the influence of the programming (Aim 3). Future studies will involve modifying this video programming based on findings from this research to promote organ donation in black owned barbershops through passive messaging with generic or targeted videos shown on large screen TVs, or with tailored programs using interactive kiosks. Through this work, we hope to reduce organ transplantation disparities through increased registration among black men who comprise a group having a disproportionally greater need for kidney transplants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will lead to increased organ donor registration among black men who visit black owned barbershops and improve understanding as to what video education strategies are best for encouraging organ donor registration in this setting. We have previously shown with our cardiovascular health promotion and cancer prevention research that, as a stage for influential peers, black owned barbershops constitute an existing and unique community setting and peer network that can be utilized to promote healthy behavior for black men.

"Impact of Cardiovascular Risk Control on Racial Disparities in Kidney Transplant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the applicant is to become an independent investigator who designs and executes studies to optimize medication utilization in kidney transplant patients, with the specific goals of reducing racial disparities in graft surviva. Black renal transplant recipients are at significantly higher risk for graft loss following kidney transplant due, in part, to well recognized immunologic hyper-responsiveness, poorer socioeconomic status and more severe comorbid conditions. Much of the previous interventions to reduce disparities in Black recipients have focused on improving access to transplant and reducing immunologic risks; yet the differences in graft survival rates between Black and non-Black kidney transplant patients have not significantly improved. To date, little attention has been directed towards improving CVD risk factor control as a potential approach to reduce racial disparities in kidney transplant. The proposed research plan will seek to test the hypothesis that CVD risk factor control significantly influences racial disparities in kidney transplant outcomes through a two phase study. Phase 1: a large-scale longitudinal cohort study conducted using national datasets (VA, CMS, and USRDS) that critically analyzes the modifying impact of CVD risk factor control on racial disparities among kidney transplants. Phase 2: The C-DRIFT trial (Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Control in Kidney Transplant) is a prospective study to explore the feasibility and potential effectiveness of pharmacist-led patient-level interventions directed at improving CVD risk factor control as a mechanism to reduce racial disparities in kidney transplant recipients. Completing these studies will provide novel and compelling preliminary data, so that by the conclusion of this award, a grant proposal will be submitted to conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial powered to test the hypothesis that optimizing CVD risk factor control will improve graft survival and racial disparities in kidney transplant patients. Additionally and equally as important, the completion of this grant will provide the applicant invaluable training and mentoring that will allow him to develop the skillset necessary to become an independently funded investigator. The proposed career development plan capitalizes on the rich interdisciplinary collaborative environment, the unique patient population, and the comprehensive didactic coursework available at the Medical University of South Carolina. The primary mentor and co-mentors on this application are highly experienced and well-funded researchers that have expertise in conducting research in racial disparities, kidney transplant and CVD interventional studies. Thus, at the conclusion of this award, novel data regarding the impact of CVD risk factor control on racial disparities in kidney transplant will be produced and disseminated while the applicant develops into a well-trained researcher, capable of conducing relevant patient-oriented research in kidney transplant recipients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited research has been focused on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor management as a mechanism to minimize inequalities in Black kidney transplant recipients. Pharmacist-led patient-level interventions to improve CVD risk factor control are novel and promising methods to improve outcomes in these high-risk patients. The aims of this grant are to better understand the role of CVD risk factor control on racial disparitis in kidney transplantation, explore promising mechanisms to improve CVD risk factor control while developing the applicant into a well-trained patient-oriented researcher.",Impact of Cardiovascular Risk Control on Racial Disparities in Kidney Transplant,8998939,K23DK099440,"['Attention ', ' Award ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Life ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Improve Access ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' graft function ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' diabetes control ', ' Regimen ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' improved outcome ', ' study population ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K23,2016,182103,0.06584590491772781
"Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities ae disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. The factors responsible for this disparity are complex and incompletely understood. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing number of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient- Oriented Research provides a unique mechanism to assist established investigators to attract and retain talented new physician-scientists to careers in patient-oriented research. The candidate for this K24 is James Lash, MD, an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Lash's research focuses on the epidemiology of CKD with a particular emphasis on minority populations. He has considerable experience as a patient- oriented researcher and is the Principal Investigator for two NIDDK-sponsored studies: 1) the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study and 2) the Hispanic CRIC Study. These studies, as well as several other multicenter collaborative studies, provide a wealth of opportunities for trainees. Dr. Lash has developed a solid track record for mentoring young investigators, including a significant number from minority backgrounds. The new research program funded by this award is a natural extension of Dr. Lash's ongoing work and will provide additional opportunities for trainees. It consists of two projects which focus on potential factors contributing to disparities in adults and children with CKD: 1) individual/neighborhood socioeconomic status, and 2) health literacy. This proposed research leverages the infrastructure of two large ongoing cohort studies (the CRIC Study and Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study) and therefore, provides a unique opportunity to examine these factors in both children and adults with CKD. In addition to mentored research, trainees will participate in didactic training through the UIC K30 Clinical Research Training Program and have access to the extensive resources and infrastructure provided by the UIC Center for Clinical Translational Science (CCTS), the UIC School of Public Health, and the UIC P60 Center for Excellence in Health Disparities. This K24 award will provide Dr. Lash with the additional time and resources to amplify his efforts in contributing to our understanding of health disparities in CKD and in training new physician scientists to become independent investigators in kidney disease research. Chronic kidney disease afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by this chronic condition.

"Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhancing CKD health: Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2) trial Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities with respect to prevalence and clinical outcomes. Measures such as glycemic control in persons with diabetes, blood pressure control, and reduction of proteinuria with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can help delay CKD decline and decrease CKD-associated morbidity and mortality; however, many individuals with CKD are not benefiting from these scientific advances. This lack of translation may be due in part to very low levels of CKD awareness among providers and patients leading to inadequate primary care provider self-efficacy for delivery of CKD care and poor patient engagement to participate in healthy lifestyles and adhere to medication regimens. To address this need, our multi-disciplinary team has developed and piloted two interventions that increasing awareness among providers and patients and translate that knowledge into more optimal CKD care. The provider intervention is a CKD registry tailored to the entire healthcare team that provides point-of-care decision support regarding CKD management and outside-of care summaries of CKD relevant clinical data to optimize delivery of guideline-concordant CKD care via outreach and population health. The patient intervention is a comprehensive self-management support program that includes low-literacy educational materials, linguistically/culturally tailored automated telephone self-management support (CKD-ATSM), health coaching, and reminder text messages. Our team has successfully piloted both interventions in a pilot feasibility study (NCT01530958) in one academic clinic that serves a low-income, multilingual population. We have since refined the interventions to integrate the registry with the electronic medical record and to include mobile texting in the self-management program. We are now poised to study the effectiveness of the refined interventions on health outcomes among a large diverse, low-income population using the Chronic Care Model framework of health care delivery. We propose a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial entitled Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2), in which we will randomize 60 providers and 400 patients with CKD in 6 federally qualified community health centers to receive the provider intervention (CKD registry) or usual care and the patient self- management support intervention (CKD-ATSM) or usual care. We will assess the impact of the provider intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 1); the patient intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 2); and their interaction (Aim 3) on patient-level clinical outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, CKD decline); provider behavioral outcomes (e.g., provider self-efficacy for CKD management); and patient behavioral outcomes (e.g., CKD awareness, participation in self-management behavior). If one or both KARE-2 interventions are effective at improving health among high-risk patients, they can be disseminated to other delivery systems to change the way CKD care is delivered in the US, leading to reductions in CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities. Delivery of effective CKD management is limited because of low levels of CKD awareness, low provider confidence in delivering CKD care, and poor patient engagement in risk- reduction behaviors. We will assess the impact multifaceted interventions that address these barriers with the goal of improving health among vulnerable patients with CKD.",Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2,9127224,R01DK104130,"['abstracting ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Publishing ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' San Francisco ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' outreach ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease registry ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Health Communication ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Qualifying ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' chronic care model ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' provider intervention ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' population health ', ' Regimen ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,634090,0.14755452303385078
"Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are less likely to become registered organ donors. In addition, although first-person consent laws have been passed in 48 states, hospitals remain reluctant to harvest organs without the consent of the registered donor's family. Epidemiologic studies on African Americans have focused on the willingness to donate organs. Little research has been done on the positive decision-making process of becoming a registered organ donor. Objectives: The goal of this project is to identify facilitators associated with becoming a registered organ donor and providing familial notification. We hypothesize that positive outcome expectations (physical, social, and self-evaluative) will be associated with increased African American organ donor registration. We also hypothesize that increased perceived self-efficacy (PSE) will be associated with increased familial notification. Design and Methods: Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a guiding framework, a qualitative study involving focus groups will be performed and then validated by large-scale quantitative telephone surveys. African Americans, age 19 and older, who made a decision regarding organ donation at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past 3 months will be stratified into those who chose to become a registered organ donor and those who declined. The dependent variables for analysis will be 1) becoming a registered organ donor and 2) family notification of the decision to become a registered organ donor. Significance: The study will identify the key factors that drive African Americans to become registered organ donors and the determinants of familial notification. This data will inform future interventions to increase African American donor registration and develop mechanisms to ensure family consent, thereby reducing disparities in organ donation and improving the health outcomes of African Americans. African Americans who registered at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past three months will be stratified into those who chose to be an organ donor and those who declined. A qualitative study involving focus groups and validated by quantitative surveys will be performed to determine the factors associated with the decision of African Americans to become registered organ donors and to inform their families of their donation wishes.",Increasing African American Organ Donation: Donor Registration & Family Consent,9396530,K23DK091514,[''],NIDDK,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K23,2016,147088,0.09349268344638881
"Ethical and Sociocultural Implications of Genetic Testing in Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is promoted to redress the shortage of kidneys for transplantation. However, studies show that living donors (LDs) have a greater risk of kidney failure than healthy non-LDs post-donation.4-6 Moreover, African American (AA) LDs have an even greater risk of kidney failure post-donation than European American (EA) LDs.4,5 These findings have generated heightened concerns in the transplant community over protecting LDs' safety and improving LDs' informed consent.7-14  Genetics may help explain this disparity. Genetics research found that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variants (1-2 alleles) are significantly associated with kidney failure predominantly in AAs.15-19 Kidney transplants from deceased donors with APOL1 variants had significantly shorter survival than kidneys from donors without variants.20 APOL1 variants may explain why AA LDs have a greater risk of kidney failure post- donation than do EA LDs.5,6,20 Thus, testing AA potential LDs for APOL1 variants could better risk stratify them.  Little is known about the transplant community's attitudes about and practices of integrating APOL1 genetic testing into the routine clinical evaluation of AA LDs. No guidelines exist for genetic testing in transplantation. While proponents believe that the evidence is strong enough to warrant APOL1 testing,21,22 critics counter that testing is premature.23 Yet some transplant centers are using APOL1 testing routinely,22 or on a case-by-case basis. Transplant centers' practices are ethically charged: (not) using APOL1 testing could harm AA LDs. LDs unknowingly with the variants might make less informed decisions and unnecessarily undergo donation, which would violate the ethical principle of non-maleficence, as LDs gain no direct medical benefit from donation.25-27 Conversely, by learning they had APOL1 variants, LDs may choose to not donate to protect themselves or prevent the recipient from getting a kidney with potentially lower graft survival. Testing may also affect AAs' cultural identity, which in turn could shape attitudes about LDs' willingness to use APOL1 testing.  The objective of this study is to assess the ethical and sociocultural implications of physicians' use of APOL1 testing for AA LDs, and to develop culturally sensitive educational materials for genetic counseling about APOL1 testing. We will assess the transplant community's normative expectations, attitudes, and current practices about testing AA potential LDs for APOL1 variants through a national survey. We will also assess AA LDs' information preferences, attitudes about, and willingness to be tested for APOL1 variants through semi-structured interviews. The results will inform the development of culturally sensitive education materials for genetic counseling about APOL1 testing, which will be refined by focus groups with AA LDs. The proposed study is timely because APOL1 testing could increase AA potential LDs' safety and reduce disparities in AA LD outcomes. This study facilitates NHGRI's initiative to better understand the implementation of emerging clinical genomics into clinical practice,32 consistent with the NIH's precision medicine's initiative.33 PROJECT NARRATIVE African American (AA) potential living kidney donors (LDs) are disproportionately more likely to get kidney failure post-donation than European Americans. Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variants may explain this disparity as they are significantly associated with kidney failure chiefly in AAs. The proposed study aims to assess the ethical and sociocultural implications of the controversial practice of APOL1 testing for AA LDs, and develop culturally-sensitive educational materials for genetic counseling about APOL1 testing in order to improve LD's safety, informed consent, and reduce disparities in AA LD outcomes.",Ethical and Sociocultural Implications of Genetic Testing in Transplantation,9166004,R03AI126090,"['clinical practice ', ' case-by-case basis ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' treatment choice ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Learning ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic Research ', ' uptake ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Living Donors ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Equipoise ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' non-maleficence ', ' Nonmaleficence ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2016,78126,0.036447303170433466

Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,9121614,K22LM011869,"['Age ', ' Albumins ', ' Archives ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Communities ', ' Creatinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' forest ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' Visit ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Career Transition Award ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' medically underserved ', ' informatics training ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' multiple reaction monitoring ', ' screening ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' inter-institutional ', ' Degree program ', ' biomarker development ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2016,135270,0.15324710777145464
"Increasing Equity in Transplant Evaluation and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). But, the evaluation process for a kidney transplant is lengthy, time consuming, and burdensome to the patient. Also, race disparities exist in rates of transplant evaluation completion, transplantation, and LDKT. Our previous and ongoing NIDDK-funded research indicates that cultural factors (i.e., perceived discrimination in health care, religious objection to LDKT), transplant knowledge, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, education, income) independently and significantly predict time to complete transplant evaluation. In December 2012 our transplant center implemented a one-day streamlined evaluation process, dubbed Kidney Transplant Fast Track (KTFT), but it has not been evaluated for efficacy or cost effectiveness. Thus, we propose a quasi-experiment to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the KTFT (n=1030) compared to historical controls (n=1140) who were recruited for our current NIDDK study to increase transplant rates. At the same time, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting vulnerable patients with the educational component of the TALK intervention (Talking About Live Kidney Donation) to increase LDKT. For both components of the application, we will target vulnerable populations because they are most at risk for extended evaluation times and lower rates of LDKT. Using CONSORT standards, participants will be randomly assigned to TALK (n=515) versus no-TALK (n=515) conditions and undergo two interviews at pre-transplant work-up and at completion of transplant evaluation in order to: (1) test whether KTFT and TALK will reduce transplant evaluation time, and increase rates of transplant and LDKT in members of vulnerable groups; (2) determine whether engaging in a streamlined and coordinated-care evaluation experience within the transplant center reduces negative perceptions of the healthcare system; and (3) test the cost effectiveness of the KTFT with TALK relative to standard practices. The results of this two-pronged approach will help pave the way for other transplant centers to implement a Fast Track system at their sites, improve quality of care by transplanting a larger number of vulnerable patients, and may help address stark race/ethnic disparities in rates of LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority patients are more likely than whites to have end stage kidney disease (ESKD), but less likely to complete transplant evaluation, receive a kidney transplant (KT) overall, or a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESKD. We will test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of a comprehensive, system-level Fast Track kidney transplant evaluation for minorities in reducing time to complete transplant evaluation and increase KT. And, using a randomized-controlled trial, we will test the effectiveness of an educational video and booklet to encourage discussion and pursuit of LDKT. Findings from this work may help reduce disparities in transplant evaluation and LDKT.",Increasing Equity in Transplant Evaluation and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation,9118172,R01DK101715,"['Age ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Work ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Reporting ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,526638,0.17311313284328367
"Blood Donor Drives & High School Students to Educate People About Organ Donation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main limiting factor for organ transplantation is a deficiency of available organs. The shortage of available organs is especially severe for African-Americans, and to a lesser extent Hispanics. Blood donors are an inherently altruistic group, but no studies have addressed whether blood donors would be more willing to sign on as organ donors than non- blood donors. Almost all blood banks now conduct blood drives in high schools, and, in San Diego, 21% of blood donated to the San Diego Blood Bank comes from high school blood drives. These drives are organized and conducted by high school students, with assistance and supervision by blood bank officials. We propose to have high school students ask blood donors and non-blood donors to sign on to the California Department of Motor Vehicles organ donor program, which can be done quickly and easily on-line. We will conduct the study in high schools and communities that have a high percentage of African-Americans and Hispanics. Our primary hypothesis is that blood donors will be more willing to sign on as blood donors than non-blood donors. After being asked to sign on as an organ donor, participating subjects will partake in a short 10 minute educational session about organ donation led by a high school student. The subjects will then again be asked to sign on as an organ donor. Our secondary hypotheses are that the educational session will increase the number of subjects who will sign on as an organ donor, and that the effect will be greater in blood donors than non-blood donors. The educational materials will be culturally sensitive, as they will be developed by a team of three to five students that will include at least one African-American and one Hispanic student. If this program is successful, it could easily be disseminated widely throughout the United States, and we demonstrate that it could increase markedly the number of organs donated by African-Americans and Hispanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The number of people who are candidates for organ transplantation far exceeds the number of organ donors; this imbalance is particularly critical for minority groups such as African-Americans. We propose to determine if high school students can increase the interest of blood donors in their communities in becoming organ donors. If successful, this study could point to a method to markedly reduce the disparity between the number of organ donors and organ recipients.",Blood Donor Drives & High School Students to Educate People About Organ Donation,9107866,R01DK098780,"['altruistic ', ' Altruism ', ' Award ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Banks ', ' Blood donor ', ' Blood Typing ', ' Blood Grouping ', ' Blood typing procedure ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Supervision ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Tissue Transplantation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Secondary to ', ' Clip ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Acute ', ' Training ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Organ Donations ', ' Graft Material ', ' Transplanted tissue ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' interest ', ' science education ', ' high school ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' student training ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,179201,0.08420916014200029
"Ethical and Sociocultural Implications of Genetic Testing in Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is promoted to redress the shortage of kidneys for transplantation. However, studies show that living donors (LDs) have a greater risk of kidney failure than healthy non-LDs post-donation.4-6 Moreover, African American (AA) LDs have an even greater risk of kidney failure post-donation than European American (EA) LDs.4,5 These findings have generated heightened concerns in the transplant community over protecting LDs' safety and improving LDs' informed consent.7-14  Genetics may help explain this disparity. Genetics research found that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variants (1-2 alleles) are significantly associated with kidney failure predominantly in AAs.15-19 Kidney transplants from deceased donors with APOL1 variants had significantly shorter survival than kidneys from donors without variants.20 APOL1 variants may explain why AA LDs have a greater risk of kidney failure post- donation than do EA LDs.5,6,20 Thus, testing AA potential LDs for APOL1 variants could better risk stratify them.  Little is known about the transplant community's attitudes about and practices of integrating APOL1 genetic testing into the routine clinical evaluation of AA LDs. No guidelines exist for genetic testing in transplantation. While proponents believe that the evidence is strong enough to warrant APOL1 testing,21,22 critics counter that testing is premature.23 Yet some transplant centers are using APOL1 testing routinely,22 or on a case-by-case basis. Transplant centers' practices are ethically charged: (not) using APOL1 testing could harm AA LDs. LDs unknowingly with the variants might make less informed decisions and unnecessarily undergo donation, which would violate the ethical principle of non-maleficence, as LDs gain no direct medical benefit from donation.25-27 Conversely, by learning they had APOL1 variants, LDs may choose to not donate to protect themselves or prevent the recipient from getting a kidney with potentially lower graft survival. Testing may also affect AAs' cultural identity, which in turn could shape attitudes about LDs' willingness to use APOL1 testing.  The objective of this study is to assess the ethical and sociocultural implications of physicians' use of APOL1 testing for AA LDs, and to develop culturally sensitive educational materials for genetic counseling about APOL1 testing. We will assess the transplant community's normative expectations, attitudes, and current practices about testing AA potential LDs for APOL1 variants through a national survey. We will also assess AA LDs' information preferences, attitudes about, and willingness to be tested for APOL1 variants through semi-structured interviews. The results will inform the development of culturally sensitive education materials for genetic counseling about APOL1 testing, which will be refined by focus groups with AA LDs. The proposed study is timely because APOL1 testing could increase AA potential LDs' safety and reduce disparities in AA LD outcomes. This study facilitates NHGRI's initiative to better understand the implementation of emerging clinical genomics into clinical practice,32 consistent with the NIH's precision medicine's initiative.33 PROJECT NARRATIVE African American (AA) potential living kidney donors (LDs) are disproportionately more likely to get kidney failure post-donation than European Americans. Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variants may explain this disparity as they are significantly associated with kidney failure chiefly in AAs. The proposed study aims to assess the ethical and sociocultural implications of the controversial practice of APOL1 testing for AA LDs, and develop culturally-sensitive educational materials for genetic counseling about APOL1 testing in order to improve LD's safety, informed consent, and reduce disparities in AA LD outcomes.",Ethical and Sociocultural Implications of Genetic Testing in Transplantation,9295961,R03AI126090,"['Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Learning ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nephrology ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic Research ', ' uptake ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Living Donors ', ' Frequencies ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' research study ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Equipoise ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Nonmaleficence ', ' non-maleficence ', ' Provider ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' case-by-case basis ', ' screening ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' Genetic study ', ' treatment choice ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2017,78251,0.036447303170433466

"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort(CRIC) Study Project Summary/Abstract Despite the dramatic growth of the Hispanic population with end stage renal disease in the U.S., relatively little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is based at the University of Illinois at Chicago and is an ancillary study to the NIDDK-sponsored multi-center CRIC Study. During the first two funding periods, the study assembled a sizable cohort of Hispanics with moderate to severe CKD and addressed critical questions. One key finding was that compared to non-Hispanics whites, Hispanics with CKD are burdened by lower socioeconomic status, poorer blood pressure control, higher depressive symptoms, and lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Furthermore, we found that Hispanics with CKD experienced a twofold higher rate of CKD progression but this disparity was explained by potentially modifiable sociodemographic and clinical factors. This finding has important implications for practice and underscores the need to better understand factors influencing risk factor control and health outcomes in Hispanics. As a result of our findings, the scientific scope of this competitive renewal has been broadened to address knowledge gaps in the following areas: 1) epidemiology of mild CKD, 2) impact of sociocultural/ psychosocial factors on CKD progression and cardiovascular events among Hispanics, and 3) influence of CKD progression on patient-centered outcomes. First, because individuals with mild CKD comprise a much larger proportion of the CKD population, improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors in early disease may have substantial public health implications. Recognizing the need to understand the epidemiology of mild CKD, the parent CRIC Study recently recruited 1500 additional adults with eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2. However, only 4% of these participants are Hispanic. Second, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that sociocultural and psychosocial factors influence health outcomes in Hispanics but these factors have not been studied in the context of CKD. Third, in addition to studying traditional clinical outcomes, there is growing recognition of the need to study outcomes defined by patients as being important. This application seeks to continue follow-up of the existing Hispanic CRIC cohort and enrich it with recruitment of 125 Hispanics with mild CKD (eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2) to accomplish the following Aims: 1) Evaluate the association of Hispanic ethnicity with risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in adults with mild CKD; 2) Investigate the association of sociocultural and psychosocial factors with CKD progression and cardiovascular events among Hispanics across the spectrum of CKD severity; and 3) Examine the relationship of CKD progression with patient-centered outcomes (e.g., HRQOL, physical function, pain) across the spectrum of CKD severity, among Hispanics and across racial/ethnic groups. The renewal of Hispanic CRIC and its continued close link to the parent CRIC Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to efficiently address a broad range of critical questions regarding the epidemiology of CKD in Hispanics. Project Narrative During the first two funding periods, the Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study has provided important insights about the burden of moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics and its impact on various outcomes. The proposed renewal expands the scientific scope of the study by focusing on mild CKD and conducting a rigorous evaluation of sociocultural/psychosocial factors and patient- centered outcomes which are relevant to the Hispanic CKD population.

"APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center Shorter allograft survival is observed for kidneys transplanted from deceased African American donors relative to those from deceased European American donors. Recent retrospective reports have indicated that the presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in the kidney donors significantly contributes to this disparity. APOL1 renal-risk variants are common in U.S. populations with African ancestry (primarily African Americans) and are strongly associated with end-stage renal disease for patients with non- diabetic kidney disease, yet these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. Before APOL1 genotypic data can be widely applied in the transplant community, however, a prospective multi-center study must be performed to evaluate outcomes of kidneys from donors with African ancestry. Critical clinical post-transplant information that was lacking in the prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, particularly kidney-biopsy data and key potential modifiers such as development of viral infections, donor-specific antibodies, and episodes of acute rejection. The NIH will fund a nationwide prospective study to assess the impact of APOL1 renal-risk variants on the outcomes of recipients of a kidney from a deceased or living donor with African ancestry and on the kidney health of living donors with African ancestry after nephrectomy. The study will consist of as many as 15 Clinical Centers and a central Scientific Data Research Center (SDRC). The Clinical Centers will collect one-time blood samples from each participant for APOL1 genotyping at the SDRC and will submit longitudinal clinical data for the recipients and living donors to the SDRC to assess the impact of APOL1 genotype on development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The results from this national study have the potential to transform organ allocation and informed consent processes in the transplantation of kidneys from donors with African ancestry, improve renal allograft survival, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby APOL1 renal-risk variants produce kidney disease. Specific variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1, which are generally restricted to persons with recent African ancestry, have been associated in retrospective analyses with increased risk of end-stage native- kidney disease and shorter survival of kidney transplants. The proposed prospective study will examine the impact of these variants on kidney-transplant recipients and donors, while taking into account various environmental or comorbid conditions that can cause kidney damage. The findings from this study have the potential to transform allocation of kidneys for transplantation, improve survival of transplanted kidneys, better inform potential kidney donors with recent African ancestry of the risks of donation, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby these genetic variants produce kidney disease.",APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center,9439431,U01DK115997,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Creatinine ', ' Salivary Gland Virus Disease ', ' Inclusion Disease ', ' Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease ', ' CMV infection ', ' Cytomegalovirus Infections ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' indexing ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Ischemia ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Lupus Nephritis ', ' Lupus Glomerulonephritis ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Lesion ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Failure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' renal clearance ', ' Renal clearance function ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Allografting ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' American ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' organ allocation ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' precision medicine ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2017,277820,0.1687060681782469
"Integrating Conservative Kidney Management Options and Advance Care Planning Into a Pre-Dialysis Educational Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pre-dialysis education programs are the standard of care for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) to learn about their options for treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, these programs do not usually include education about conservative kidney management (CKM) or advance care planning. Informed decision-making about dialysis treatments becomes especially important for elderly and frail patients with advanced CKD as they may experience frequent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and early death once they are initiated on dialysis. There are also racial disparities in dialysis knowledge, advance care planning and end-of-life (EOL) preferences between Black and White patients with advanced CKD that have been attributed to Blacks having less understanding of their treatment options. Advance care planning education has been used to improve decision-making among diverse cohorts of chronic hemodialysis patients however the integration of CKM and advance care planning education into pre-dialysis education programs in order to improve knowledge and communication of care options while also reducing racial disparities has not been well studied. The proposed scientific program has three research aims: (1) To conduct an open pilot study of an educational intervention (Conservative Kidney Management Options and Advance Care Planning Education – COPE) that is integrated into standard pre-dialysis education among frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD to assess its feasibility and acceptability, (2) To test, in a pilot randomized controlled trial, the preliminary efficacy of COPE on improving knowledge of CKM and advance care planning and increasing communication about ESRD treatment and EOL care preferences among frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD, and (3) To explore whether COPE reduces racial disparities in CKM and advance care planning knowledge as well as communication of ESRD and EOL care preferences among Black and White frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD. Dr. Eneanya proposes a career development program that includes methodological training and mentorship by senior faculty to develop and evaluate knowledge assessment tools, engage effectively with seriously ill patient populations, and pilot an intervention to detect racial differences in treatment knowledge and end-of-life communication. The long-term goal of this career development award is to develop Dr. Eneanya into an independent health services researcher with expertise in survey research methods, informed decision-making models of care, and clinical trials among minority and renal populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the United States, elderly and frail patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly initiated on dialytic treatments despite the unclear effects on mortality and quality of life for this population. Furthermore, racial minority patients are diagnosed more frequently with advanced CKD but experience barriers to informed dialysis decision-making and quality end-of-life care. The proposed study seeks to test a pre-dialysis educational intervention to promote informed treatment decision-making, improve advance care planning, and decrease racial disparities in treatment knowledge and communication of care preferences among Black and White frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD.",Integrating Conservative Kidney Management Options and Advance Care Planning Into a Pre-Dialysis Educational Program,9370911,K23DK114526,"['Acids ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Anemia ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electrolytes ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Fluid Balance ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Program Development ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' frail older adult ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' education planning ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' end-of-life communication ', ' end of life communication ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Secure ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' senior faculty ', ' full professor ', ' racial minority ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' physical symptom ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2017,173360,0.07383286432006815
"Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media Summary Over 90,000 individuals in the United States await kidney transplantation. Only about 12,000 will receive a deceased donor transplant each year, and recent efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, most candidates on the waiting list have a higher chance of dying than of being offered a deceased donor kidney. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) eliminates the wait and offers superior survival, but accounts for fewer than 6,000 additional transplants per year despite a huge potential pool of millions of adults living in the US. Worse, LDKT rates are lowest among Hispanic and African American candidates who account for over 30% of the waitlist. Regardless of race, known barriers to identifying a live donor include lack of education, reluctance to discuss one's illness, and hesitance to ask others to donate. We have developed two novel interventions to address these barriers. The first is a 6-month training program that combines education, advocacy, and instrumental support by pairing candidates with a live donor champion (LDC): a friend, family member, or community member trained to spread awareness of ESRD, LDKT, and the candidate's story throughout their social network. The second is a less-intensive Facebook (FB) app (designed in collaboration with FB leadership) that leverages the broad reach of social media to spread awareness, facilitating FB posts about the candidate's story, providing links to education about ESRD and LDKT, and documenting the candidate's search for a donor through a ""chronically viral"" Facebook story. In pilot studies at our center, participants of both interventions were significantly more likely to undergo LDKT compared to matched controls. While encouraging, pilot testing has been non-randomized and limited to our center and its unique patient population. Furthermore, it remains unclear how intense an intervention is necessary, i.e. the less-intense FB approach or the more-intense champion approach. To assess the real- world effectiveness of the LDC program and/or the Facebook app in expanding live donation among a heterogeneous population of waitlist candidates, we now propose to test these interventions at three busy transplant centers that serve a heterogeneous group of largely underserved patients. The relative dearth of deceased donors has caused a profound organ shortage; it is essential to turn to novel efforts that increase live donation. Development and widespread implementation of culturally competent LDC and Facebook App interventions has the potential to increase the overall incidence of LDKT while also addressing disparities in access to LDKT.   Public Health Relevance There is a crisis in the United States with over 100,000 people on the transplant waitlist. Efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful so we must now turn to living donation to confront the shortage. Barriers to increasing living donation are largely due to communication, thus we look to novel interventions using social media and social networks to address the problem. Pilot programs with these interventions have proven successful at our center and we now wish to test dissemination to other centers, especially those caring for some of our most underserved patients.",Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media,9330646,R01DK111966,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Awareness ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Leadership ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Friends ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Organ ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' social media ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,599977,0.14033710212403408
"Social Network Analysis and Renal Education to Promote Transplantation (SNARE Transplant) Project Summary Candidate: Although the majority of my training has been clinical, I have developed a unique area of research applying social network theory to examine kidney transplant disparities in hemodialysis patients. My short‐term goals are to obtain the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully complete the proposed research and to conduct theoretically‐grounded, translational research in kidney transplantation. My long‐term career goals are to become an experienced, independent researcher applying social network theory and analytic techniques to improve outcomes for disadvantaged patients with kidney disease. Career Development Plan: My career development plan combines didactic coursework, professional training, and mentored instruction. Specifically, I propose to earn through the College of Public Health and Center for Biomedical Informatics a Master's in Epidemiology and participate in training activities to increase my knowledge of and proficiency in public health, epidemiology, health behavior theory, health communication, social network theory, transplant epidemiology, biomedical ethics, social network analysis, and computing. Research Plan: Women and ethnic minorities are less likely to be informed of the option of transplantation, referred to a transplant center, and complete the medical evaluation needed to be placed on the kidney transplant waiting list. The goal of this research study is to identify and characterize the complete social networks of hemodialysis (HD) patients. We will measure the relative influence of HD social networks on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards transplantation. We will use repeated survey measures as well clinical observations to construct models of these social networks. Finally, we will conduct a transplant education intervention pilot study that tests the diffusion of knowledge and behaviors through the hemodialysis clinic social network.

"Reducing disparities in living donor transplant among African Americans Abstract For most of the patients in the United States with end stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplantation represents the optimal treatment. Moreover, living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) offers numerous advantages over deceased donor kidney transplant such as better kidney quality, increased short- and long- term graft survival, lower rates of acute rejection, and reduced health care cost. Nevertheless, there are pervasive racial disparities in access to LDKT, with white ESRD patients four times more likely to receive a LDKT than African American ESRD patients. The long-term objective of this program of research is to understand the combined effect of a systems-level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians (Transplant Referral EXchange or T-REX) and a culturally-sensitive individual-level educational intervention (web-based Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing) on racial disparities in access to LDKT. The specific aims of the study are: (a) To develop and refine a web-based version of Living ACTS; (b) To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web-based Living ACTS intervention by comparing the percent of patients with at least one inquiry from a potential living donor among patients who receive Living ACTS compared to those who receive a control website with an embedded educational video; and (c) To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web-based Living ACTS intervention by adapting commonly used process evaluation constructs (context, reach, dose received, fidelity, and recruitment) for an online environment. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among a sample of 800 African American ESRD patients in the southeastern United States (ESRD Network 6 in Georgia and South Carolina), the region of the country with the largest proportion of African American ESRD patients on the waiting list. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions (intervention or control). Participants at all four collaborating transplant centers will be seen by providers who utilize T-REX, thus allowing us to test the independent effect of individual-level education on a systems-level intervention. The primary outcome is the percent of patients with at least one living donor inquiry. Secondary outcomes will test the effect of the intervention on key constructs of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to determine possible mediating pathways. Participants will undergo baseline assessment, access either the intervention or control educational materials, and complete an immediate follow-up assessment. Living donor inquiries will be examined over the subsequent 12 months. The process evaluation will utilize transplant center administrative records, immediate follow-up data from participants, website usage statistics, and study records. It is anticipated that achievement of these aims will yield outcomes with great clinical and public health impact. Narrative There are pervasive racial disparities in access to living donor kidney transplant, which for the majority of end stage renal disease patient represents the optimal treatment. The proposed study seeks to determine whether a systems-level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians coupled with culturally-sensitive individual level education is more effective at increasing access to living donor kidney transplant among African Americans than the systems-level intervention alone. In doing so, this study seeks to have a positive impact on public health and the vision of NIDDK, part of which is to seek insights and answers regarding health disparities in end stage renal disease.",Reducing disparities in living donor transplant among African Americans,9393729,R01DK114891,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Grant ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Administration ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Motivation ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Friends ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' stem ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' follow up assessment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' trial design ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,244299,0.10368551800856261
"MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CKD Project Summary  The purpose of the renewal of this mid-career investigator award titled, “Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD (MADRAD)” by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics and Public Health at the University California Irvine School of Medicine and UCLA School of Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research endeavors with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several University of California and Veterans Affairs-affiliated campuses in Southern California. These centers provide care to underserved, indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis for survival. In the US, African Americans and Hispanics have a substantially higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (3.5 and 1.5 times higher, respectively) than non-Hispanic Whites. While the overall 5-year survival of ESRD patients is less than 40%, with the highest mortality risk observed among malnourished patients, minority dialysis patients exhibit lower mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival differences and the contribution of nutritional status and dietary factors to these disparities may have major clinical and public health implications.  The PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race/ethnicity. Several alternative hypotheses related to racial/ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms, bone and mineral disorders, mental health and psychosocial factors, and dialysis treatment characteristics will also be examined. The PI proposes a 5-year prospective patient-oriented research study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,500 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African American and 1/3 Hispanic), in collaboration with Southern California dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status, quality of life, clinical events, and survival will be longitudinally assessed. Genetic factors such as APOL1 risk alleles will also be examined, and biospecimens for future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects, additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be developed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 150,000 HD patients.  The support of the K24 award for this prospective study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue to expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator for early-career investigators in renal nutrition and CKD disparities by leveraging his networking relationships across several campuses and centers including the University of California system and its Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Kaiser Permanente of Southern Calif., UCLA Public Health, and LA and Orange County Health Departments; (2) continue to expand his persistent efforts in increasing the participation of minority populations in CKD research studies across Southern California; and (3) continue his cultivation of an innovative area of CKD disparities and nutrition research through promising early career investigators and the ongoing support of collaborators in Southern California. The data and hypotheses generated during this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to promote additional patient-oriented studies by mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Relevance of Research to Public Health  Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and their relationship with nutritional status, diet, genetic factors, and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to the development of more effective strategies to improve the survival and quality of life of dialysis patients, an additional 20 million CKD patients, and an additional 30 to 40 million Americans who suffer from chronic disease states associated with wasting disorders such as chronic heart failure. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important objectives.","MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

"Living Donor Wage Reimbursement Trial PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The waiting list for kidney transplantation (KT) now exceeds 100,000 and waiting times exceed 7 yrs in some U.S. regions. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) accelerates the path to transplantation and yields superior outcomes compared to dialysis and deceased donor KT. However, the annual number of LDKTs has declined over the last decade, particularly among minority and low-income patients. We hypothesize, and have preliminary data to support, that the financial impact on living donors (LDs) is a major contributor to the LDKT decline and for persistent racial disparities in LDKT rates. Many LDs have substantial non-reimbursed direct and indirect costs, most notably the loss of income or wages following surgery. In this study, we will: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of offering reimbursement for LD lost wages on the LDKT rate; (2) examine whether offering reimbursement for LD lost wages reduces known racial disparities in LDKT; and (3) determine whether study outcomes differ significantly by maximum reimbursement amount for LD lost wages. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a blended randomized trial and matched historical control study with a planned enrollment of 350 KT candidates who will be randomized to one of two parallel arms: (1) possible reimbursement of LD lost wages up to $1,500 (LW-1.5), or (2) possible reimbursement of LD lost wages up to $3,000 (LW-3.0). Our central hypotheses are that offering reimbursement for LD lost wages will (a) yield higher LDKT rates overall relative to matched historical controls, and (b) reduce the disparity between LDKT rates in white and minority patients relative to historical patterns. Also, we hypothesize that KT candidates who are offered up to $3,000 reimbursement for LD lost wages will have a higher likelihood of LDKT compared to those offered up to $1,500 of reimbursement for LD lost wages. Finally, we will assess the impact of offering reimbursement for LD lost wages on the decision-making of both KT candidates and potential LDs as well as perceptions of pressure/coercion and decision stability. Overall, the proposed study will be the first to empirically examine the impact of offering LD lost wages reimbursement on the willingness of KT candidates to pursue LDKT, racial disparity in LDKT, rates of LD evaluations, and actual LDKT rates. Moreover, this study will be the first to examine the differential impact on these outcomes of offering to reimburse LD lost wages for different amounts ($1,500 vs. $3,000) after donation. As such, findings from this study have very high potential to impact policy, clinical practice, LDKT access, and known income and racial disparities in KT. The assembled interdisciplinary research team has a long track record of collaboration and is internationally recognized for developing innovative strategies to increase LDKT access in disadvantaged patient populations, extramural funding to conduct large RCTs and multi-center studies, and dissemination of research findings with broad policy and clinical practice implications. PROJECT NARRATIVE This application is responsive to numerous calls within the transplant field to empirically evaluate the benefits and costs associated with removing financial disincentives for living kidney donors. If successful, findings from this study will directly address several HealthyPeople2020 objectives (Objectives: CKD HP2020-2, CKD HP2020-5, CKD HP2020-6, CKD HP2020-13), recommendations made in the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) report on organ donation, and recommendations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation.

"Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney to benefit a loved one or even a stranger, but the long-term consequences of donating a kidney, particularly in African Americans, are poorly understood. In this study, we will study high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and post-donation treatment patterns in largest ever primary cohort of African American donors, Caucasian American donors, matched healthy non-donor controls (who were cleared for donation but did not ultimately donate because of recipient factors), and other matched healthy individuals (who participated in large cohort studies and were deemed healthy enough to have likely passed a donor evaluation). Our findings will influence the practice of live kidney donation in the United States, particularly among African Americans, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care.",Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans,9300914,R01DK096008,"['Anemia ', ' bone disorder ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medical Records ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Minerals ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Phonation ', ' Privatization ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' Agreement ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Data ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' data registry ', ' prehypertension ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,637577,0.17693976748080628
"Metabolomics and Genomics in African Americans with CKD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Two recent discoveries suggest that common, African-specific genetic risk factors are particularly relevant in CKD susceptibility. Variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) and the presence of a single copy of the sickle cell mutation (sickle cell trait, or SCT) both increase the risk of CKD progression. How these variants confer kidney risk, whether there is gene-gene interplay, and the identity of any causal intermediates is unknown. The proposed studies will use two complementary cohorts of African Americans with CKD, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) and a subset of BioMe, to investigate these questions. The AASK study is arguably the most comprehensively phenotyped of African Americans with CKD in the world, assessing participants' kidney function every 6 months for up to 12 years (and up to 17 years for end-stage renal disease and death). BioMe is an ongoing, contemporary cohort of patients receiving medical care in New York City, with substantial resources devoted to biospecimen collection and genotyping. The analysis will build upon our prior work in genetic risk factors for CKD by investigating novel variants and their relationship to kidney function decline as well as gene-gene interplay in risk for adverse CKD outcomes. In addition, we will study the relationship of metabolomic patterns - a snapshot of the end-product of cellular processes - with CKD outcomes. This analysis can lead to identification of novel and potentially modifiable risk factors for CKD outcomes. When combined with genomic data, the metabolomic consequences of genetic risk variants such as the APOL1 high-risk genotype or SCT can be studied. In addition, analytic techniques can help distinguish whether metabolomic risk factors cause adverse CKD outcomes or are simply a byproduct of an associated process. Understanding the relationship between genomics, metabolomics, and outcomes will advance knowledge regarding pathogenic pathways and potentially modifiable targets in CKD progression, particularly in African Americans, an ethnic group disproportionately affected with advanced CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Recent studies have identified two African-specific genetic variants which may explain much of the ethnic differences in CKD risk. Understanding gene function, and in particular the metabolomic intermediates which may be targeted by interventions, can provide critical information that will lead to reductions in CKD incidence and

"Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for kidney transplantation continues to exceed the supply. Increasing the number of living kidney donors is a major priority. Historically, living donors were healthy and free of isolated medical abnormalities (IMA) at the time of donation. Recently, general US population demographics have changed, and in response, transplant centers now include donors with IMAs such as pre-hypertension (pre-HTN), obesity, and metabolic syndrome. At a general population level, individuals with IMAs, particularly African Americans (AA), are more likely to develop comorbidities, such as diabetes, HTN, and chronic kidney disease. Recent data suggest that AA living kidney donors are more likely to have a pre-donation IMA. It remains unclear what impact, if any, living donation will have on development of these comorbidities, and whether racial disparities in risk attributable to donation exist. Current methods for assessing living donor long-term health risks are imprecise, relying heavily on traditional factors such as family and social histories. Morphometric measures (e.g. vascular calcifications; fat distribution), using radiologic imaging, have emerged as strong predictors of cardiovascular risk. Pre-donation imaging, routinely acquired during donor evaluations to assess renal anatomy, can be leveraged to identify novel morphometric risk predictors for post-donation comorbidities. I hypothesize that morphometric measures will greatly improve prediction of post-donation comorbidities, including risk directly attributable to donation. Given significant knowledge gaps in risk prediction and stratification of donors with IMAs, I propose an ancillary study that will leverage data from an ongoing R01-funded cohort study of live donors to create the largest cohort of IMA donors studied and will address unique aims: (1) explore the association of novel morphometric measures and traditional risk factors with post-donation comorbidity stratified by race; (2) develop a risk tool for predicting post-donation comorbidities; and (3) estimate risk attributable to living kidney donation. Utilization o novel morphometric measures obtained from routine pre- donation imaging is innovative, highly practical, and will create a level of risk prediction of living donor outcomes that currently does not exist. Precise risk prediction will improve informed consent, donor autonomy in medical decision making, and will change the practice of live kidney donor selection in the US. Resources and infrastructure at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, including the most AA living kidney donors in the US, are keenly in-line with the proposed aims, and will provide the necessary foundation to see the proposed project to its successful completion. The mentored award will foster my growth as an independent investigator by affording me opportunities to focus on building an expertise in novel risk prediction research and enhancing my exposure to health disparities and chronic disease epidemiology in minority populations. This additional training will inform my path toward long-term career goals of research independence as a surgeon-scientist and R01 funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the demand for kidneys continues to exceed the supply, transplant centers have begun to relax selection criteria to include living donors with obesity and/or high blood pressure. Expansion of selection criteria has occurred despite a paucity of supporting safety data. It is critical to balance increasing live donation for transplant candidate against the responsibility of understanding long-term risks specific to donors at the extremes of current selection criteria for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care.",Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities,9267456,K23DK103918,"['Alabama ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Award ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Event-Free Survival ', ' Disease-Free Survival ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Vascular calcification ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Categories ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Stratification ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' prehypertension ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictive tools ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2017,179629,0.1640769313831251
"Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation Project Summary  End stage renal disease (ESRD) is among the ten leading causes of death for Americans, and its incidence and prevalence are rising, especially among non-White groups. Kidney transplantation is the most effective treatment option for many Americans, but the number of Americans needing kidneys is currently much larger and rising much faster than current transplant levels. Patients who seek transplants have one of two options: wait for a kidney from a deceased donor to become available, or obtain a transplant from a living kidney donor. Deceased donor kidney transplant levels are projected to grow little over time, constrained by population aging and mortality patterns, but living donation donor kidney transplantation (LDD KT) holds the prospect of substantial growth if healthy population members are willing and able to donate. Unfortunately, there are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in LDD KT rates that compound disparities in rates of ESRD. Prior research hypothesizes that differential access to healthy, compatible donors in candidates' social networks may explain racial disparities in usage of LDD KT. However, a limitation of this work is that it focuses on those who are evaluated for donation, not the many members of transplant candidates' social networks who could be evaluated for donation, but are not. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT. Based on qualitative interviews and a pilot survey of 72 transplant candidates we previously collected in a large transplant center, we suspect that the differential access hypothesis does not hold, and that there are promising points of social intervention for researchers to reduce racial disparities in LDD KT. These pilot data show large LDD KT underutilization for all candidates, and that Black candidates have access to promising living donors at higher rates than White candidates. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the primary barrier to eliminating disparities in LDD KT and promoting greater utilization of LDD KT for all groups is social, not biomedical, in origin. In this proposal, we will extend our prior work to develop and test evidence based, randomized social network interventions that will target social barriers to LDD KT and follow up with candidate medical records to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. Specifically, we will compare a control group of candidates to those assigned to two treatments that we will pilot and test: a) a search intervention where a subset of candidates is coached to approach promising family members that seem to be underutilized based on our pilot data, and b) a rhetorical intervention where we encourage a subset of candidates to use scripts for discussing transplantation with family members that we find to be effective in survey vignette experiments and focus groups. With eighteen month medical records follow up of all candidates and the large amount of data we will obtain on their social networks, we will assess the social barriers that lead to underutilization of LDD KT, how those factors vary by race, and how they can be reduced through promising social network interventions. LDD KT has substantial potential to solve public health challenges around the growing prevalence of ESRD, and the basic and applied knowledge that we will develop as part of this proposal will help to unlock this potential.   Project Narrative  This project will evaluate underutilization of living donor donation kidney transplantation (LDD KT) at two large kidney transplant centers and develop and test evidence based, randomized interventions to increase LDD KT and reduce racial disparities in its use. LDD KT is the most promising treatment option to meet the challenges of a rising population of Americans with end stage renal disease (ESRD), but LDD KT rates are not increasing and racial disparities in the use of LDD KT are widening. Prior research has documented that non-white transplant candidates are less likely than white candidates to have family or friends evaluated for LDD KT, and that those evaluated for donation to non-white candidates are less likely to be deemed healthy and compatible enough to donate than those evaluated for white candidates, but it has not examined the full family and social networks in which candidates are embedded in order to determine whether limited access to healthy, compatible donors drives underutilization and racial disparities or whether other social barriers are in operation. This neglect is unfortunate because there are many non-medical interventions that could be tested to increase rates of LDD KT by giving candidates more information about what types of family members to approach and how to approach them. Prior qualitative and quantitative pilot work we have conducted suggests that some of the largest barriers arise from decisions candidates make about which family members to ask for kidney transplants, and whether family members volunteer to be evaluated upon hearing of a candidate's diagnosis. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social network interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT, which we will evaluate with longitudinal medical records follow up. In the first year and a half of the project, we will build on prior qualitative, quantitative, and experimental pilot data we have collected to develop and refine two separate interventions in focus groups and survey vignette experiments. In years two through four, we will survey transplant candidates at two large transplant centers about their family and social networks, with special attention to candidate perceptions of their network members' health and willingness and ability to donate. During this time, we will also survey candidate network members using effective referral based survey strategies in order to obtain additional information on the barriers to donation among family and close social network members of kidney transplant candidates. We will assign each surveyed candidate to one of three experimental arms that encompass the interventions developed during the first year and a half of the project: a control group, a group that we coach on which of their network members to approach, and a group that we coach on how to approach their network members. In years four and five of the project, we will follow up on the candidates, examining whether they had a potential donor evaluated, who that donor was, and whether they were able to obtain a living donor transplant. The results of this project will contribute to basic and applied knowledge about social barriers to access in LDD KT, and quantify the efficacy of promising social network approaches for promoting greater utilization of LDD KT and reducing racial disparities therein.  ",Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation,9393673,R01DK114888,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Kinship Networks ', ' Respondent ', ' Organ Donations ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' tool ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' volunteer ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2017,246237,0.11358149906998188
"Gender Disparities and Vascular Function in Chronic Kidney Disease Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is Ana C. Ricardo, MD, MPH, a nephrologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Dr. Ricardo's short-term goals are to gain experience and develop skills by conducting research focused on gender disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the contribution of gender differences in endothelial function to these disparities. Her long-term career goals are to become an independent investigator conducting research focused on reducing health inequalities in CKD through lifestyle interventions. To achieve her goals, Dr. Ricardo has assembled a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentored research and didactic coursework at the UIC School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's strong team of mentors and collaborators includes world-class experts with longstanding NIH funding and extensive mentorship experience. Her primary mentor, James P. Lash, MD, is an expert in the epidemiology of CKD in minority populations; Martha L. Daviglus, MD, PhD, her co-mentor, has expertise in the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. The proposal also includes a multidisciplinary team of collaborators with expertise in the areas of women's health, longitudinal data analyses, and the influence of exercise on vascular function. Dr. Ricardo's successful development into an independent physician-scientist will be facilitated by the extensive facilities and resources available at UIC which include the Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Center for Research on Women and Gender, and the School of Public Health. Dr. Ricardo's research will advance her skills in both primary data collection and longitudinal data analyses. The proposal leverages the infrastructure of the NIH- funded Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, a large and diverse observational study of adults with CKD. Evidence suggests that there are significant gender-related disparities in CKD. Whereas data from the United States Renal Data System indicate that men have 1.5 times greater incidence of end-stage renal disease, a higher prevalence of CKD in women was seen in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Several studies suggest that men have more rapid CKD progression, but this has not been a consistent finding. Furthermore, previous studies were not designed to address this question and included few racial/ethnic minorities. In the general population, there is evidence that differential rates of cardiovascular outcomes in women and men may be related to gender differences in endothelial function, which have been in part attributed to the protective effect of estrogen in women. Moreover, limited data suggest that endothelial dysfunction may be a predictor of CKD progression. However, the contribution of endothelial function to gender disparities in CKD progression is not known. This is an area of significance because studies of non-CKD populations suggest that endothelial function may be improved with pharmacologic therapy (e.g., ACE- inhibitors) or lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise). The specific aims for the proposed project are to 1) Examine gender disparities in kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in the CRIC Study; 2) Examine gender differences in endothelial function and the role of endothelial function as a predictor of CKD progression in 150 University of Illinois CRIC Study participants; and 3) Evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week pilot resistance exercise training intervention and its effect on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This Career Development Award will provide the foundation for Dr. Ricardo to pursue an independent research career dedicated to reducing health disparities in CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem in the U.S. and evidence suggests that outcomes are different for men and women with CKD. The aims of this proposal are to 1) Identify modifiable factors responsible for gender disparities in CKD outcomes; 2) Evaluate the impact of vascular function on gender disparities in CKD progression; and 3) Conduct a pilot study evaluating the effect of resistance exercise on vascular function and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with CKD. This research will fill important gaps in our knowledge and potentially lead to the development of targeted interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with CKD.",Gender Disparities and Vascular

"A Pilot Feasibility Trial of Thyroid Hormone Replacement in Dialysis Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Three decades of research have shown a disproportionate prevalence of hypothyroidism (~25%) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, including those receiving dialysis. While hypothyroidism has been associated with heightened cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in the general population, there had previously been a paucity of data on its prognostic implications in CKD. During the first 2¼ years of the parent K23 award, Dr. Connie Rhee (PI) has published pioneering studies showing that elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels even within the normal range (>3.0mIU/L) are associated with higher mortality across multiple dialysis cohorts. Her seminal work showing a link between high-normal TSH levels and worse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) Short Form 36 (SF36) scores in dialysis patients also suggest that impaired HRQOL may be an under-recognized pathway to death. However, there remains considerable controversy as to 1) whether thyroid dysfunction is causally associated with adverse CV and patient-centered outcomes, 2) if elevated TSH levels represent hypothyroidism vs. non-thyroidal illness in CKD patients, and 3) the optimal TSH range associated with the greatest health benefit in dialysis patients. Furthermore, while United States Renal Data System data show that levothyroxine (L-T4) is one of the most commonly prescribed medications in pre-dialysis CKD and end-stage renal disease patients, little is known about its efficacy and safety in this population.  These discoveries have motivated the present R03 application in which Dr. Rhee aims to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of L-T4 administration over 12 weeks among 96 hemodialysis patients with high-normal or subclinical hypothyroid TSH levels who will be recruited from her parent NIH/NIDDK K23 study and the K24-sponsored “Malnutrition, Diet, and Racial Disparities in CKD” cohort. Aim 1 will determine L-T4’s efficacy in achieving a target TSH range of 0.5- 3.0mIU/L (primary objective). Aim 2 will examine whether L-T4 treatment results in improvement of 1) HRQOL SF36 scores and 2) novel CV biomarkers of heart failure, endothelial function, and platelet activation, 3) without leading to increased protein catabolism ascertained by indices of protein-energy wasting (secondary objective). Findings from this pilot feasibility study will provide the framework for a future, large-scale multi- center RCT that 1) may uncover thyroid dysfunction as a novel, modifiable risk factor for CV disease and impaired HRQOL, and 2) will inform the management of the vast number of CKD patients affected by this prevalent endocrine-renal disorder. Moreover, support of the R03 award will allow Dr. Rhee to accelerate her progress towards independence by providing her with 1) practical experience in the implementation of a pilot feasibility RCT, 2) hands-on exposure to translational medicine and laboratory platforms through CV biomarker testing, and 3) extension of the rich multi-disciplinary collaborations she has developed during the parent K23 award period. NARRATIVE Hypothyroidism, defined by elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels, is a common endocrine complication of chronic kidney disease that has been associated with impaired quality of life and cardiovascular complications. While levothyroxine is one of the most frequently prescribed medications in chronic kidney disease patients, little is known about its efficacy and safety in this population. This study will investigate 1) whether levothyroxine adequately lowers thyrotropin (TSH) levels to therapeutic target ranges, and 2) if thyroid hormone replacement improves quality of life and cardiovascular markers, without leading to wasting (i.e., loss of body mass, fat, and/or muscle mass) in dialysis patients.",A Pilot Feasibility Trial of Thyroid Hormone Replacement in Dialysis Patients,9375962,R03DK114642,"['Affect ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' Body Composition ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Complication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hypothyroidism ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity -

"2/2 APOL1 Long-Term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network- Clinical Center Project Summary (Abstract) The Columbia-Penn Clinical Consortium (CPCC) brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team of clinical and basic scientist investigators at Columbia University Medical Center and University of Pennsylvania Transplant Programs. The CPCC investigators have expertise in the fields of transplant epidemiology, immunology, genetics and ethics, as well as an extensive history of collaboration with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and other CPCC member transplant programs. As a result, the CPCC is well suited to recruit and retain patients for longitudinal follow up for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Research Network (APOLLO). This proposed Clinical Center will comprise of 26 pediatric and adult large, medium and small size transplant centers and 9 organ procurement organizations predominantly in four contiguous states (NY, NJ, CT and PA) in the northeast US. Our primary objective is to enroll all donors of African ancestry (e.g. African-Americans and Black Hispanic) and their recipients within the consortium for genetic and genomic studies by the APOLLO Network (Aim 1). We will follow all recruited donor-recipient pairs with longitudinal collection of biospecimens and clinical outcomes along with pragmatic integration with Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), UNOS and the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data (Aim 2). Our experience in the recruitment and retention of minority patients in multicenter studies, as well as the use of innovative analytics with linkage to UNOS, USRDS and other geospatial data, will be of benefit to the APOLLO Network. We expect that our unique design and implementation expertise to the APOLLO study will address the hypothesis that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants is associated with inferior allograft outcomes following kidney transplant and increases the risk of adverse renal outcomes for affected living donors. Project Narrative The APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Research Network (APOLLO) aims to determine the impact of APOL1 genetic variants on transplant outcomes for recipients of kidneys from donors of African ancestry (e.g. African-Americans and Black Hispanics). The Columbia-Penn Clinical Consortium for APOLLO (CPCC-APOLLO) will recruit and follow-up all donor-recipient pairs involving donors with African heritage from 26 transplant centers and 9 organ procurement organizations predominantly in 4 contiguous states (NY, NJ, CT and PA) for genetic and genomic studies by the APOLLO Network.",2/2 APOL1 Long-Term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network- Clinical Center,9441552,U01DK116066,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Censuses ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Heterozygote ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Trypanosomiasis ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Immunology ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Collaborations ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' System ', ' Allografting ', ' Penetrance ', ' psychosocial ', ' Inferior ', ' experience ', ' gene interaction ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Genomics ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' high risk ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Genetic study ', ' Retrospective cohort study ', ' ']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2017,282821,0.14066469132487663
"Patient Oriented Research in Kidney Disease and Transplant Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 600,000 adults in the US suffer from ESRD. For the appropriate patients, kidney transplantation (KT) reduces mortality, improves quality of life, and saves substantial Medicare dollars. However, selecting patients for KT can be challenging, particularly among certain subgroups such as older adults, and current metrics are of limited utility in informing clinical decision-making. Furthermore, once selected for KT, patients face similar challenges when considering deceased donor offers or deciding if to allow friends or family to put themselves at risk as living donors. Predicting which patients would benefit from KT, and optimally matching them to the right donor, is one of the most critical concerns for patients, transplant physicians, and referring nephrologists. This is a proposal for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award for Dorry Segev, MD, PhD, an Associate Professor of Surgery and Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Segev leads three major R01-funded patient- oriented research efforts to address the challenges of ESRD and KT clinical decision-making: (1) A prospective study of frailty and risk prediction among older dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients; (2) A retrospective study of long-term outcomes and survival benefit from incompatible live donor kidney transplantation; and (3) A multi-center longitudinal study of long-term sequelae of kidney donation. In addition to addressing the aims of the individual grants, these studies provide rich substrate for ancillary studies by mentees, including thousands of patients engaged in several cohorts, as well as many opportunities for advanced methodologic training. Dr. Segev is actively mentoring students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty in an exciting, productive multidisciplinary environment. This K24 will afford future mentees the opportunity to leverage Dr. Segev's rich ongoing research portfolio with the following new aims: (1) To better understand dialysis and KT outcomes important to older adults; (2) To quantify secondary risks of incompatible KT protocols; (3) To elucidate familial, genetic, and non-renal risks after kidney donation; (4) To design models to assist KT candidates with organ offer decisions; and (5) To expand Dr. Segev's capacity to mentor the next generation of clinician-scientists in ESRD and KT by pursuing formal training in mentoring, learning leadership skills from experts at JHU, continuing to foster multidisciplinary collaborations across the institution, connecting with mentors and mentees from across the country, and refining a curriculum for teaching patient-oriented research to surgeons and other clinicians PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predicting which patients would benefit from kidney transplantation, and best matching them to the right kidney donor, is one of the most critical concerns for patients, transplant physicians, and referring nephrologists. This award will allow Dorry Segev, MD, PhD and his team of mentees to better understand risk prediction by examining outcomes important to older adults, risks of immunosuppression associated with transplantation, and risks of donating a kidney.

"Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney to benefit a loved one or even a stranger, but the long-term consequences of donating a kidney, particularly in African Americans, are poorly understood. In this study, we will study high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and post-donation treatment patterns in largest ever primary cohort of African American donors, Caucasian American donors, matched healthy non-donor controls (who were cleared for donation but did not ultimately donate because of recipient factors), and other matched healthy individuals (who participated in large cohort studies and were deemed healthy enough to have likely passed a donor evaluation). Our findings will influence the practice of live kidney donation in the United States, particularly among African Americans, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care.",Long-Term Health Outcomes After Live Kidney Donation in African Americans,9444791,R01DK096008,"['Anemia ', ' bone disorder ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medical Records ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Minerals ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Phonation ', ' Privatization ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' Agreement ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Data ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' data registry ', ' prehypertension ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,139722,0.17693976748080628
"Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium Summary/Abstract Data demonstrate that transplanted kidneys from African American (AA) deceased donors are associated with reduced survival relative to kidneys from non-AA donors. Additional data demonstrate that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants, that are found exclusively in AA individuals, have been associated with an increased risk of CKD/ESRD in the general AA population. Two risk variants of this gene have a prevalence of 13% in AAs, and may account for some or all of the increased risk of transplant loss. There are also anecdotal reports of AA living kidney donors with two APOL1 risk variants developing ESRD raising further concerns. The APOLLO study proposes to enroll all deceased and living AA kidney donors in order to definitively address the impact of APOL1 variants on kidney transplant outcomes. The Emory APOLLO Clinical Centers consortium is comprised of 12 centers distributed across the US but focused in the Southeast. In 2015 these 12 programs transplanted 219 kidneys from deceased and living AA donors accounting for about 9% of all recipients of AA kidneys, the eligible study cohort in the US. The specific aims of our consortium are: (1) to perform APOL1 genotyping on all AA deceased and living kidney donors and create a sample repository for future studies to determine whether additional genetic factors contribute to the second hit postulated to be required for risk manifestation, (2) to compare the survival and function of all transplanted kidneys from AA donors to determine the impact of two APOL1 risk variants on transplant outcomes as well as exploring the potential of environmental factors (rejection, infections, comorbid conditions such as hypertension) to provide the second hit, and 3) to study whether African American living donors who carry two copies of the variant APOL1 genes are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease. Blood samples for APOL1 genotyping of deceased donors will be provided by the organ procurement organization, while the transplant centers will provide blood for genotyping recipients and living donors (as well as deceased donors when necessary). Demographic and clinical donor and recipient data will be provided by UNOS for all subjects. More granular clinical data will be provided for patients receiving their long-term follow up from one the 12 participating transplant centers. We propose enrolling subjects for 1 year and following them for 3 years thereby maximizing the likelihood of observing clinical events. The primary outcome measure for recipients of deceased donor kidneys is graft survival with secondary outcome measures assessing a variety of indicators of renal function and injury. As advance CKD or ESRD following living kidney donation are highly unlikely events, given the relatively short study duration the primary outcome for living kidney donors will be the change in renal function from the post-transplant baseline to the end of follow up at 3 years post-donation. When combined with the data from the other 14 APOLLO Clinical Center Consortia, we believe our data will contribute to a much more complete understanding of the impact of APOL1 gene variants on the outcomes of kidney transplantation and donation. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE STATEMENT: This study will improve the public health by determining if transplanted kidneys from African American donors who have two specific copies of variants of the apolipoprotein L1 gene (called APOL1) fail more rapidly than kidneys donated by African Americans without two variant copies of these genes. Should this study confirm the negative impact of the variant APOL1 genes this information would be very helpful for transplant professionals counseling patients in need of kidney transplantation about the benefits and risks of accepting a kidney transplant from a donor with two variant copies of APOL1 versus waiting for a transplant from a different donor at a later time. This study will also determine whether otherwise healthy African American patients who have these genes can safely be living kidney donors, or whether the presence of the two APOL gene variants increases their risk of kidney disease so much that they cannot safely donate.",Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium,9441436,U01DK116099,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood donor ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Injury ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' uroplakin III ', ' Uroplakin 3A ', ' Uroplakin 3 ', ' UPK3A ', ' UPK3 ', ' UPIIIA ', ' UP3 ', ' UPK3 gene ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Allografting ', ' Inferior ', ' Services ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' hazard ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' graft failure ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' sharing data ', ' Regimen ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,277820,0.1788708586833125
"A Culturally Targeted Transplant Program to Increase Live Donation in Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The shortage of organs for kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is magnified in Hispanics/Latin Americans. Hispanics have a disproportionately higher prevalence of ESRD, yet receive fewer kidney transplants compared to non-Hispanic whites. Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the treatment of choice for ESRD as it confers better patient and graft survival, shorter waiting time, and better quality of life than deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, compared to their representation on the waiting list, fewer Hispanics received a LDKT than non-Hispanic whites in 2013: 4 percent versus 10 percent. Barriers to LDKT for Hispanics include: lack of knowledge, cultural concerns, and language barriers. The disparity will likely worsen without intervention as Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the US.  Few available culturally competent interventions have led to increased LDKT rates. Interventions rarely address Hispanic cultural concerns, and there are no published models of transplant center-based only programs. The Chicago Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program (HKTP), a culturally and linguistically competent program, has increased Hispanic LDKTs. The mean annual ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs grew from 0.20 in 2001-2006 to 0.34 in 2008-2013, a 70 percent increase (p<0.001).  The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the HKTP, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations (Dallas, TX, and Los Angeles, CA), with Northwestern University serving as the Study Coordinating Center. The pre-post HKTP intervention study will evaluate the effect of the HKTP's key culturally sensitive components (outreach, communication, education) on Hispanic LDKT rates, compared to matched controls. The specific aims are to:  1. Implement the HKTP at two transplant centers by conducting a needs assessment of barriers and using a ""learning collaborative"" model to deliver HKTP protocols, scripts, and materials.  2. Conduct a pre-post HKTP intervention evaluation with matched controls to assess if the HKTP is associated with an increase in: a) the ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs as a function of an absolute increase in Hispanic LDKTs, b) ESRD Hispanic patient additions to the waiting list, c) Hispanic potential donors per potential recipient, and d) Hispanic patients' satisfaction with care.  3. Formatively evaluate the fidelity and innovative adaptations to HKTP's outreach, communication, and education at both study sites to identify effective components of the HTKP, using mixed methods.  As an exploratory aim, a budget impact analysis will be conducted to construct a business case for transplant centers and permit estimates of HKTP scalability. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally, improve health outcomes for Hispanics, and close the LDKT disparity gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic/Latino patients with end-stage renal disease are disproportionately less likely to get a kidney transplant, and specifically, a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, without LDKTs, Hispanics experience longer transplant waiting times, shorter patient and graft survival, and worse quality of life. Cultural beliefs and linguistic barriers contribute to the disparity in LDKTs. The objectie of the proposed study is to implement and evaluate Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally.",A Culturally Targeted Transplant Program to Increase Live Donation in Hispanics,9245701,R01DK104876,"['Accounting ', ' Belief ', ' Budgets ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Social Workers ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' satisfaction ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Media Campaign ', ' cultural values ', ' outreach ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' treatment choice ', ' Latin American ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,704066,0.13892423852372274
"Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those on dialysis, have a substantially higher prevalence of hypothyroidism (HT) compared to their non-CKD counterparts. In the general population, HT is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, presumably due to atherosclerosis, platelet activation and thrombosis, and coronary heart disease (CHD) events. CKD patients have an exceedingly high CV mortality, with many of these fatalities related to CHD. However, little is known about the prognostic implications of HT on the CV health and survival of CKD patients.  Dr. Connie Rhee is a nephrologist at the University of California Irvine (UCI) with a strong commitment to the fields of endo-nephrology and drug comparative effectiveness in CKD. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator with a specific focus on thyroid functional disorders in kidney disease. The support of the K23 award will allow Dr. Rhee to achieve the following objectives: 1) investigate the impact of HT and its treatment on CHD risk and survival in CKD patients; 2) gain practical experience in the execution of patient-oriented research; 3) develop proficiency in navigating innovative multidisciplinary collaborations in nephrology, endocrinology, cardiovascular disease, and human subjects research; 4) and acquire expertise in advanced epidemiologic and biostatistical methods.  In order to accomplish these objectives, Dr. Rhee will first examine the longitudinal impact of HT on mortality in a well-characterized prospective hemodialysis (HD) cohort in whom thyroid function will be rigorously defined using a combination of novel and traditional assays (Aim 1). She will then examine the association between HT and 3 specific CV surrogate endpoints (endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification, and platelet activation) that represent major pathogenic mechanisms contributing to CHD risk in CKD (Aim 2). Lastly, she will examine the degree to which the association of HT with mortality is modified by underlying renal function in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients, and if these associations are ameliorated by thyroid hormone treatment using advanced analytic techniques (marginal structural modeling) that improve causal inference (Aim 3). Dr. Rhee will efficiently leverage resources from the NIDDK-sponsored ""Malnutrition, Diet, and Racial Disparities in CKD"" multicenter study and the unique strengths of the NIDDK-sponsored national Veterans Affairs (VA) database as she implements these Specific Aims. Findings from this proposed research will have the potential to uncover HT as a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse CV outcomes in CKD; improve the diagnostic approach and management of this highly prevalent endocrine-renal disorder; and reduce the excess burden of CV death in this vulnerable population. Dr. Rhee will be closely guided by her primary mentor, Dr. Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at UCI whose vast experience in patient-oriented research will be complemented by Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary co-mentor and collaborator team: 1) Dr. Gregory Brent, Professor, Chair of Medicine at the Greater Los Angeles VA, and renowned leader in thyroid hormone research; 2) Dr. Danh Nguyen, Professor and Director of the UCI Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit with expertise in the longitudinal evaluation of CV risk factors in dialysis patients; 3) Dr. Steven Brunelli, Associate Epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Senior Director of DaVita Clinical Research with extensive experience in causal inference methods; 4) Dr. Csaba Kovesdy, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at the Memphis VA widely known for his research in the national veteran population; and 5) Dr. Matthew Budoff, Professor and Director of Cardiac Computed Tomography at Harbor UCLA with expertise in cardiovascular diagnostic imaging methods.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hypothyroidism is a common complication in chronic kidney disease patients, who represent a sizeable portion of the US population. While hypothyroidism has been associated with an accelerated risk of coronary heart disease and death in the general population, little is known about the impact of hypothyroidism on the exceedingly high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease patients. This study will investigate 1) whether hypothyroidism magnifies the risk of coronary heart disease and mortality in patients with varying degrees of impaired kidney function, and 2) the role of thyroid hormone treatment in reducing hypothyroid-related death risk in chronic kidney disease, which will advance our understanding of whether hypothyroidism is a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in this vulnerable population.","Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease",9267451,K23DK102903,"['atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Complication ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypothyroidism ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for kidney failure is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which provides an average of 10 additional years of life compared to staying on chronic dialysis. Unfortunately, large racial/ethnic disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics comprise over 58 percent of all dialysis patients but receive less than 28 percent of LDKTs. A little-studied and likely crucial cause of LDKT disparities is the lower likelihood that Black and Hispanic donor volunteers (persons interested in donating a live kidney) will complete the multi-step donor evaluation and actually donate. While minority donor volunteers are more likely to have medical contraindications to donation, they are also much more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation or decline participation in paired exchange (programs that permit LDKT using immunologically incompatible donor-recipient pairs). Based upon limited prior research, the outcomes of the donor evaluation may be especially affected by several potentially modifiable individual and health care system factors, such as donor volunteers' motivation to donate, health literacy, knowledge/education about donation, satisfaction with the patient care experience, and socioeconomic barriers to donation. These factors, however, have not been prospectively examined in a well-powered, multi-center, and diverse cohort of donor volunteers. The objective of this study is to determine how differences in modifiable individual and system factors are associated with Black and Hispanic donor volunteers' lower likelihood of actually donating. Our overall hypothesis is that donor volunteers who are Black or Hispanic are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, due to modifiable differences that either (1) are already present at the start of the evaluation, o (2) arise later in the evaluation process. To test this hypothesis, we propose a sequential mixed methods study. First, we will perform qualitative interviews of donor volunteers who previously discontinued their donor evaluations, to identify all the potentially modifiable causes of discontinuation of the donor evaluation (Aim 1). Then, in the quantitative component, we will perform a prospective cohort study of 2,800 live kidney donor volunteers at two large transplant centers in New Jersey and California. Among 575 Black, 875 Hispanic, and 1,350 White donor volunteers, we will determine differences in potentially modifiable factors that are present at the start of the donor evaluation (Aim 2) or arise during the evaluation (Aim 3), and also determine the impact of modifiable factors upon successful completion of the donor evaluation (Aim 4) and actual donation, directly or via paired exchange (Aim 5). At the end of this study, we will understand how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their potentially modifiable social, behavioral, and health services characteristics and how these factors impact both completion of the evaluation and actual donation. Our results, generalizable to the 230+ kidney transplant centers in the U.S., will enable us to design future interventions to improve the education, support, and care of live donor volunteers, to ultimately decrease racial/ethnic disparities in LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For patients with kidney failure, the best treatment option is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but Blacks and Hispanics with kidney failure are much less likely to receive LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics may receive fewer LDKTs because their live donor volunteers are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, possibly due to modifiable reasons. This study will examine how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their motivation, education, perceptions of care, and socioeconomic barriers to donation, and how these potentially modifiable factors impact whether donor volunteers successfully complete evaluation and actually donate.",Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation,9248215,R01MD007664,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Saints ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' volunteer ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' ']",NIMHD,ST.

"Sugarcane workers, medical visits, and kidney function ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Mesoamerica is a leading killer of workers in agricultural communities. The objective of this proposal is to examine whether symptoms and injuries that sugarcane workers experience may also be adversely impacting kidney function. Heat stress, volume depletion, and muscle injury have been theorized to play a role in developing CKD. Many previous studies of CKD in Mesoamerica are cross-sectional or examine change in kidney function over a relatively short period of time. In the proposed research, we will investigate this issue in a study of 243 sugarcane industry with different jobs. We have available complete work histories for all subjects and medical records with details of each medical visit abstracted. These provide information on whether workers experienced dysuria, exhaustion, muscle injury, or back injury. For Aim 1, we will examine whether medical visits for these reasons occurred disproportionately by job type. In particular, cane cutters are thought to endure the most intense heat and greatest physical exertion. Next, we're interested in whether dysuria, exhaustion, muscle injury, or back injury are more likely to lead to long-term kidney change. For Aim 2, we will evaluate if workers seeking medical care for these reasons experienced a more rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), an indicator of kidney function. Study follow-up covers up to 14 years, and is positioned to make critical contributions to our understanding of factors affecting CKD in afflicted agricultural communities. This work relates closely to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'s Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing Sector. It also aligns with two Cross-Sectors: Cancer, Reproductive, and Cardiovascular Diseases; and Occupational Health Disparities as Hispanic workers disproportionately work in some of the more dangerous jobs. This research aligns with the NIOSH Research to Practice goals because it will identify medical conditions for which intervention can occur prior to development of a chronic condition.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A high prevalence of a distinct form of chronic kidney disease has been reported in Mesoamerica, primarily among agricultural workers, for whom common risk factors (obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) are largely absent. We will examine whether specific types of medical visits (e.g., dysuria, muscle injury, and burns) during their employment vary by job type and whether these medical visits may be associated with a subsequently reduced kidney function. This research may shed light on which medical conditions occurring during agricultural work increase a worker's risk of developing kidney dysfunction and potentially chronic kidney disease.        ","Sugarcane workers, medical visits, and kidney function",9421485,R21OH011120,[''],NIOSH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,253433,0.06448338478835253
"Cleveland Precision Medicine Chronic Kidney Disease Cohort Project Abstract Although hypertension is associated with ~25% of end-stage renal disease (H-ESRD) in the United States, the pathogenic mechanisms that drive the initiation and progression of hypertension-associated chronic kidney disease (HTN-CKD) are unclear. The incidence of H-ESRD is 4- to 5-fold greater in African American populations than in whites. To address this health disparity, the Cleveland KPMP Recruiting Network will recruit a cohort of CKD patients with HTN-CKD. Prospective participants with CKD stage 3a will be identified by automated, scheduled queries of the electronic health records (EHR) of two large health care delivery systems in Cleveland, OH, the Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth. Eligible candidates will be enriched for subjects likely to progress by using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation to identify individuals with > 15% probability of developing ESRD in 5 years. This Network plans enrollment of 10 participants each year during the two year UG3 exploratory phase and 40 to 50 subjects each year for the subsequent, three year UH3 implementation phase. Once kidney research biopsy safety is established in UG3, HTN-CKD subject inclusion criteria in UH3 will be modified to include proteinuric CKD Stage 2 patients. Subjects with other CKD phenotypes can be recruited to support consortium goals. After informed consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a baseline MRI to image kidney structure and a research kidney biopsy and then be followed every 6 months at standard of care visits for the duration of the KPMP. Baseline and longitudinal biosamples will be collected and linked through REDCap to clinical data in the EHRs. The Network plans to obtain additional healthy and disease kidney samples from living donor kidney implant biopsies and an additional tissue core obtained at an indication biopsy from HTN-CKD patients, respectively. Clinical data, biopsy blocks and biosamples will be submitted to Central Hub repositories. The Network includes a Community Partnership Committee composed of CKD patients and families, physicians and an ethicist to guide implementation of this KPMP Network. In anticipation of Opportunity Pool funding, the PIs have recruited co-investigators, who will utilize the rich KPMP molecular, radiologic and histopathologic phenotypes and longitudinal clinical data for discovery. Since excess risk in African Americans for HTN-CKD is largely explained by genetic variations in APOL1, our initial research goal in UH3 is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this association. We will integrate molecular and clinical phenotypes with visual and subvisual morphologic descriptors to discover the cells and associated molecular pathways mediating APOL1-associated HTN-CKD. In pilot, proof- of-principle studies, we used computational methods and identified a set of sub-visual morphologic features that discriminated 10 African American kidney transplant implant biopsies with high risk APOL1 genotypes from 6 implant biopsies with low risk APOL1 genotypes. Creative strategies that integrate KPMP datasets will define other research questions to identify biologic pathways driving CKD and result in new CKD therapies. Project Narrative Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) affect over 20 million Americans, but their causes are poorly understood and CKD often worsens despite treatment. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) will recruit adults from around the United States for a research kidney biopsy and long term follow-up in order to discover causes of CKD and improve outcomes and care of CKD patients. The Cleveland KPMP Recruiting Network will enroll individuals with mild to moderate kidney injury attributed to high blood pressure and collect their kidney tissue; blood, urine and stool samples; and de-identified health information. Working with KPMP scientists, together we will improve diagnosis and treatment of CKD in order to stop or reverse kidney damage, which often results in death or need for dialysis for CKD

"Leveraging ancestry to map kidney loci ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease is a progressive and heterogeneous condition that affects 10% of individuals worldwide, and a cause of premature cardiovascular disease and death. Little is known about the mechanisms leading to its development and predisposition. Despite the strong evidence for a role of ancestry in chronic kidney disease susceptibility, few studies have leveraged ancestry for gene discovery. Hispanics are an understudied minority group that is comprised of many overlapping ancestral groups (Amerindian, West African, European). Hispanics have a high prevalence of increased albuminuria and end-stage renal disease, which has been associated with their Amerindian ancestry. We propose to identify ancestry-specific loci, and their corresponding rare and common genetic variants, that explain the higher susceptibility for chronic kidney disease in Hispanics. We will use novel admixture mapping approaches to map genomic segments and variants inherited from the ancestral population with the higher disease variant frequency (Aim 1), followed by fine-mapping and validation of associations in ancestry-specific cohorts (Hispanics, American Indians, European and West Africa ancestries) (Aim 2). We will leverage data from the large population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos for gene discovery, and propose to fine-map Amerindian loci using a combination of genotyping and targeted sequencing. To gain insights into the functional roles of identified genes, we will prioritize variants for experiments using in vitro and mouse model systems for transgenic and gene targeting studies (Aim 3). This proposal leverages ancestry to identify loci for kidney traits in Hispanics, and uniquely complement large ongoing genome wide association approaches. Our results will provide clues to racial/ethnic disparities in disease risk, and improve understanding of the biological pathways leading to chronic kidney disease. Ultimately this research could inform personalized medicine and improve public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study proposes to identify genetic variants that explain ethnic variation in chronic kidney disease susceptibility in Hispanic/Latinos and American Indians, two understudied populations for genetic risk of chronic kidney disease. Findings from this study may have a broad impact on informing ethnic disparities in disease risk, could inform personalized medicine and improve public health of U.S. minority population.

"Wake Forest APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all US kidney transplants from African American kidney donors to determine their effect on transplant outcomes. In addition, the post- donation health and kidney function of African American living kidney donors will be assessed. We are applying to be the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC) for this NIH Funding Announcement. Shorter renal allograft survival is observed for transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors, relative to deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute to the disparity. These variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease, but rare in other racial/ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients in order to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. This information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation are made and regarding the safety of living kidney donation. Before this genotypic data can be used clinically, a prospective national study is required to evaluate all kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from retrospective studies needs to be collected, including recipient APOL1 genotypes, renal histologic data in failed allografts and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. We will perform the following activities for the APOLLO Network: overall study coordination, assist with preparation of the final protocol and Manual of Procedures, develop data tracking tools and the study website, collect and archive clinical and outcomes data, perform genotyping, statistical analyses, assessment of the primary outcome “time to allograft failure in transplanted kidneys from African American donors, based on donor APOL1 genotypes” and create a bio-repository. We will longitudinally assess vital status, kidney function and proteinuria in living African American kidney donors based on APOL1 genotypes. Prospective assessment of the effects of kidney donor APOL1 genotypes on serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria in transplant recipients with functioning allografts will also be performed. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors.

"Wake Forest Collaborative Application for an APOLLO Clinical Center We are applying to participate as an APOLLO Clinical Center in this national prospective study. The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all U.S. kidney transplantations from African American donors to determine their effects on transplant outcomes. In addition, the health of living African American kidney donors will be assessed. Information that was lacking from prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. Our investigative team, led by two PIs with complementary expertise, has led the way in clinical trials to address the marked disparities in African Americans with end-stage kidney disease. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute. These renal-risk variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease. In contrast, these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may prove to be clinically useful in those with recent African ancestry in the setting of allocation of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and assessment of prospective living kidney donors. Genotypic information (precision medicine) may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. Information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation. However, before these genotypic data can be used in the clinical setting, a prospective national study is required to evaluate kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from prior retrospective studies will be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. This is the rationale and setting for the current APOLLO trial. In this important multi-site study, our site will work closely with the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center and the other participating sites to recruit and prospectively follow eligible kidney donors and transplant recipients based on the APOLLO protocol. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors; reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that donors having kidney disease risk variants in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene may contribute.

"Reducing Disparities among Kidney Transplant Recipients Abstract: Disparities exist in access and outcomes of kidney transplantation. More than half of patients are hospitalized in the year after transplantation, and these patients are more likely AA and have lower socioeconomic status. Several studies have identified risk factors for hospital admission using traditional statistical methods, but models have been limited by moderate predictive accuracy, the use of static (rather than dynamic) models, and the use of administrative data that may not capture the changing risk factors pre- to post-transplant. The overall goal of this research is to develop and validate rigorous, dynamic risk prediction models, integrate these models within a clinician dashboard, and develop potential interventions to address surgical disparities in hospitalization following kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are 1) To develop and validate predictive models to identify transplant recipients at high risk of hospitalization following transplant; 2) To use a community-based participatory research approach to build an electronic hospitalization risk dashboard that will aid in clinical decision-making and guide the use of scarce resources for patients at high risk for hospitalization post-transplant. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant outcomes and reduce disparities among a primarily AA ESRD population in the Southeastern US. Project Narrative/Relevance: The proposed study seeks to utilize predictive analytics to develop and validate risk prediction models to identify patients at high risk for hospitalization following kidney transplantation, integrate the models into an existing clinical decision support platform for population health management, and use a community-based participatory research approach to inform development of a dashboard to deploy resources that will help improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities in kidney transplantation.",Reducing Disparities among Kidney Transplant Recipients,9381581,R01MD011682,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' time use ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Patient risk ', ' data visualization ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' dashboard ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,444559,0.10316886172741535
"Increasing Equity in Transplant Evaluation and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). But, the evaluation process for a kidney transplant is lengthy, time consuming, and burdensome to the patient. Also, race disparities exist in rates of transplant evaluation completion, transplantation, and LDKT. Our previous and ongoing NIDDK-funded research indicates that cultural factors (i.e., perceived discrimination in health care, religious objection to LDKT), transplant knowledge, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, education, income) independently and significantly predict time to complete transplant evaluation. In December 2012 our transplant center implemented a one-day streamlined evaluation process, dubbed Kidney Transplant Fast Track (KTFT), but it has not been evaluated for efficacy or cost effectiveness. Thus, we propose a quasi-experiment to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the KTFT (n=1030) compared to historical controls (n=1140) who were recruited for our current NIDDK study to increase transplant rates. At the same time, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting vulnerable patients with the educational component of the TALK intervention (Talking About Live Kidney Donation) to increase LDKT. For both components of the application, we will target vulnerable populations because they are most at risk for extended evaluation times and lower rates of LDKT. Using CONSORT standards, participants will be randomly assigned to TALK (n=515) versus no-TALK (n=515) conditions and undergo two interviews at pre-transplant work-up and at completion of transplant evaluation in order to: (1) test whether KTFT and TALK will reduce transplant evaluation time, and increase rates of transplant and LDKT in members of vulnerable groups; (2) determine whether engaging in a streamlined and coordinated-care evaluation experience within the transplant center reduces negative perceptions of the healthcare system; and (3) test the cost effectiveness of the KTFT with TALK relative to standard practices. The results of this two-pronged approach will help pave the way for other transplant centers to implement a Fast Track system at their sites, improve quality of care by transplanting a larger number of vulnerable patients, and may help address stark race/ethnic disparities in rates of LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority patients are more likely than whites to have end stage kidney disease (ESKD), but less likely to complete transplant evaluation, receive a kidney transplant (KT) overall, or a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESKD. We will test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of a comprehensive, system-level Fast Track kidney transplant evaluation for minorities in reducing time to complete transplant evaluation and increase KT. And, using a randomized-controlled trial, we will test the effectiveness of an educational video and booklet to encourage discussion and pursuit of LDKT.

"Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhancing CKD health: Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2) trial Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities with respect to prevalence and clinical outcomes. Measures such as glycemic control in persons with diabetes, blood pressure control, and reduction of proteinuria with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can help delay CKD decline and decrease CKD-associated morbidity and mortality; however, many individuals with CKD are not benefiting from these scientific advances. This lack of translation may be due in part to very low levels of CKD awareness among providers and patients leading to inadequate primary care provider self-efficacy for delivery of CKD care and poor patient engagement to participate in healthy lifestyles and adhere to medication regimens. To address this need, our multi-disciplinary team has developed and piloted two interventions that increasing awareness among providers and patients and translate that knowledge into more optimal CKD care. The provider intervention is a CKD registry tailored to the entire healthcare team that provides point-of-care decision support regarding CKD management and outside-of care summaries of CKD relevant clinical data to optimize delivery of guideline-concordant CKD care via outreach and population health. The patient intervention is a comprehensive self-management support program that includes low-literacy educational materials, linguistically/culturally tailored automated telephone self-management support (CKD-ATSM), health coaching, and reminder text messages. Our team has successfully piloted both interventions in a pilot feasibility study (NCT01530958) in one academic clinic that serves a low-income, multilingual population. We have since refined the interventions to integrate the registry with the electronic medical record and to include mobile texting in the self-management program. We are now poised to study the effectiveness of the refined interventions on health outcomes among a large diverse, low-income population using the Chronic Care Model framework of health care delivery. We propose a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial entitled Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2), in which we will randomize 60 providers and 400 patients with CKD in 6 federally qualified community health centers to receive the provider intervention (CKD registry) or usual care and the patient self- management support intervention (CKD-ATSM) or usual care. We will assess the impact of the provider intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 1); the patient intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 2); and their interaction (Aim 3) on patient-level clinical outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, CKD decline); provider behavioral outcomes (e.g., provider self-efficacy for CKD management); and patient behavioral outcomes (e.g., CKD awareness, participation in self-management behavior). If one or both KARE-2 interventions are effective at improving health among high-risk patients, they can be disseminated to other delivery systems to change the way CKD care is delivered in the US, leading to reductions in CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities. Delivery of effective CKD management is limited because of low levels of CKD awareness, low provider confidence in delivering CKD care, and poor patient engagement in risk- reduction behaviors. We will assess the impact multifaceted interventions that address these barriers with the goal of improving health among vulnerable patients with CKD.",Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2,9326983,R01DK104130,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Publishing ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' San Francisco ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Multilingualism ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Practice Management ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' outreach ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Health Communication ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' chronic care model ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' provider intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' population health ', ' Regimen ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' Patient risk ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,667231,0.14755452303385078
"A Culturally Targeted Transplant Program to Increase Live Donation in Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The shortage of organs for kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is magnified in Hispanics/Latin Americans. Hispanics have a disproportionately higher prevalence of ESRD, yet receive fewer kidney transplants compared to non-Hispanic whites. Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the treatment of choice for ESRD as it confers better patient and graft survival, shorter waiting time, and better quality of life than deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, compared to their representation on the waiting list, fewer Hispanics received a LDKT than non-Hispanic whites in 2013: 4 percent versus 10 percent. Barriers to LDKT for Hispanics include: lack of knowledge, cultural concerns, and language barriers. The disparity will likely worsen without intervention as Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the US.  Few available culturally competent interventions have led to increased LDKT rates. Interventions rarely address Hispanic cultural concerns, and there are no published models of transplant center-based only programs. The Chicago Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program (HKTP), a culturally and linguistically competent program, has increased Hispanic LDKTs. The mean annual ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs grew from 0.20 in 2001-2006 to 0.34 in 2008-2013, a 70 percent increase (p<0.001).  The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the HKTP, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations (Dallas, TX, and Los Angeles, CA), with Northwestern University serving as the Study Coordinating Center. The pre-post HKTP intervention study will evaluate the effect of the HKTP's key culturally sensitive components (outreach, communication, education) on Hispanic LDKT rates, compared to matched controls. The specific aims are to:  1. Implement the HKTP at two transplant centers by conducting a needs assessment of barriers and using a ""learning collaborative"" model to deliver HKTP protocols, scripts, and materials.  2. Conduct a pre-post HKTP intervention evaluation with matched controls to assess if the HKTP is associated with an increase in: a) the ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs as a function of an absolute increase in Hispanic LDKTs, b) ESRD Hispanic patient additions to the waiting list, c) Hispanic potential donors per potential recipient, and d) Hispanic patients' satisfaction with care.  3. Formatively evaluate the fidelity and innovative adaptations to HKTP's outreach, communication, and education at both study sites to identify effective components of the HTKP, using mixed methods.  As an exploratory aim, a budget impact analysis will be conducted to construct a business case for transplant centers and permit estimates of HKTP scalability. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally, improve health outcomes for Hispanics, and close the LDKT disparity gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic/Latino patients with end-stage renal disease are disproportionately less likely to get a kidney transplant, and specifically, a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, without LDKTs, Hispanics experience longer transplant waiting times, shorter patient and graft survival, and worse quality of life.

"Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhancing CKD health: Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2) trial Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities with respect to prevalence and clinical outcomes. Measures such as glycemic control in persons with diabetes, blood pressure control, and reduction of proteinuria with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can help delay CKD decline and decrease CKD-associated morbidity and mortality; however, many individuals with CKD are not benefiting from these scientific advances. This lack of translation may be due in part to very low levels of CKD awareness among providers and patients leading to inadequate primary care provider self-efficacy for delivery of CKD care and poor patient engagement to participate in healthy lifestyles and adhere to medication regimens. To address this need, our multi-disciplinary team has developed and piloted two interventions that increasing awareness among providers and patients and translate that knowledge into more optimal CKD care. The provider intervention is a CKD registry tailored to the entire healthcare team that provides point-of-care decision support regarding CKD management and outside-of care summaries of CKD relevant clinical data to optimize delivery of guideline-concordant CKD care via outreach and population health. The patient intervention is a comprehensive self-management support program that includes low-literacy educational materials, linguistically/culturally tailored automated telephone self-management support (CKD-ATSM), health coaching, and reminder text messages. Our team has successfully piloted both interventions in a pilot feasibility study (NCT01530958) in one academic clinic that serves a low-income, multilingual population. We have since refined the interventions to integrate the registry with the electronic medical record and to include mobile texting in the self-management program. We are now poised to study the effectiveness of the refined interventions on health outcomes among a large diverse, low-income population using the Chronic Care Model framework of health care delivery. We propose a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial entitled Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2), in which we will randomize 60 providers and 400 patients with CKD in 6 federally qualified community health centers to receive the provider intervention (CKD registry) or usual care and the patient self- management support intervention (CKD-ATSM) or usual care. We will assess the impact of the provider intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 1); the patient intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 2); and their interaction (Aim 3) on patient-level clinical outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, CKD decline); provider behavioral outcomes (e.g., provider self-efficacy for CKD management); and patient behavioral outcomes (e.g., CKD awareness, participation in self-management behavior). If one or both KARE-2 interventions are effective at improving health among high-risk patients, they can be disseminated to other delivery systems to change the way CKD care is delivered in the US, leading to reductions in CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities. Delivery of effective CKD management is limited because of low levels of CKD awareness, low provider confidence in delivering CKD care, and poor patient engagement in risk- reduction behaviors. We will assess the impact multifaceted interventions that address these barriers with the goal of improving health among vulnerable patients with CKD.",Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2,9539476,R01DK104130,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Publishing ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' San Francisco ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Multilingualism ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Practice Management ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' outreach ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Health Communication ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' chronic care model ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' provider intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' population health ', ' Regimen ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' Patient risk ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,78036,0.14755452303385078
"Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to transplant are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the transplant process. In 2014, our SEKTx Coalition conducted a randomized, multicomponent intervention (Reducing Disparities In Access to kidNey Transplantation [RaDIANT]) Community Study in GA, the state with the lowest kidney transplant rates in the nation, consisting of patient- and provider-focused educational and engagement interventions designed to increase referral for transplant evaluation among AA ESRD patients. This study was effective in improving referral for kidney transplantation among AA in GA, but efforts to improve access to kidney transplantation must be expanded beyond GA and should include interventions targeting steps beyond referral to the medical evaluation at the transplant center. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to eliminate racial disparities in every step of the kidney transplant process. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine reasons for racial disparities in medical evaluation for kidney transplantation among dialysis patients in GA, NC and SC. Specific Aim 2: Implement the RaDIANT Regional Study in GA, NC, and SC with the goal of increasing rates of referral, medical evaluation, and waitlisting, and reducing disparities in these key steps. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a process and outcome evaluation of the RaDIANT Regional Study interventions.

"Evaluation of Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation in New National Kidney Allocation Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The public health burden of kidney failure in the United States is substantial, with more than 600,000 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. There are two main treatments for kidney disease - dialysis or kidney transplantation. A complex, multi-tiered national system regulates kidney disease care, reimbursement, and transplantation, creating barriers to overcoming the significant racial disparities that exist in transplantation, the most effective treatment for ESRD. The federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network of the United Network for Organ Sharing oversees the allocation of all deceased donor organs in the US, and on Dec. 4, 2014, a major change to the allocation policy was implemented that is expected to impact racial disparities in transplantation access. We propose to study the impact of the natural experiment offered by enactment of this new kidney allocation policy on reducing disparities in the key steps of referral for transplant evaluation, wit listing, and transplantation, each of which have complexities for measurement at the local and national level. In addition, to impact disparities reduction at the service delivery level, we willuse national data to develop and then disseminate a systems-level practice of providing feedback to dialysis centers about their transplant performance to improve overall wait listing rates and decrease disparities in kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the new kidney allocation policy will lead to a reduction in disparities in transplantation at 1 year, we will prospectively examine the impact of the policy changes on racial disparities in the key steps in the transplant process post- vs. pre- allocation: a) referra from the dialysis facility for transplant evaluation in the Southeast, where we have access to this unique data, and b) wait listing and transplantation in the US. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of a systems-level approach to providing tailored transplant performance feedback and education about the kidney allocation policy, we will conduct a multicomponent, clinical effectiveness-implementation study among 750 US dialysis facilities which treat >50,000 dialysis patients. We anticipate that increasing provider knowledge will reduce disparities in transplant wait listing. The long-term impact of this application will be to influence the way organs are allocated in the US to ensure equitability through better analysis of policy and dissemination of best practices at the health systems level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study seeks to examine whether a change in the national kidney allocation policy resulted in a reduction in racial disparities in access to ke steps to kidney transplantation, and to leverage a systems-based approach to conduct a national effectiveness-implementation study of a tailored performance feedback report among US dialysis facilities with racial disparities in transplant wait listing.",Evaluation of Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation in New National Kidney Allocation Policy,9395796,R01MD010290,"['Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Feedback ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Methodology ', ' National Health Policy ', ' North Carolina ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' South Carolina ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Wit ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' organ procurement transplantation network ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' federal policy ', ' organ allocation ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Wait Time ', ' service delivery ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,507689,0.14107272964431145

"Differential survival selections and care-related determinants among African Americans and Hispanics versus whites with chronic kidney disease Project Summary This proposal represents our continuing efforts to contribute to NIDDK's Strategic Plan to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end-stage renal disease (ESRD; stage 5 CKD). Despite extensive research over the last two decades, critical knowledge gaps persist. First, African Americans (AAs) and Hispanics continue to have 2-3 times higher incidence of ESRD than non-Hispanic whites (whites), but paradoxically have much better survival than whites after reaching ESRD and undergoing dialysis. Speculation is that this apparent survival advantage is related to survival disadvantage and inadequate care for AAs and Hispanics during the pre-ESRD period, but confirming this has been hampered by methodological challenges. Second, we still do not understand how differences in mortality between minorities and whites evolve over time as the disease advances. And third, we do not fully grasp how processes of care, which are potentially modifiable and vital to improving outcomes, affect survival selections among minorities (vs. whites).  To close these longstanding knowledge gaps, we propose to conduct the first event-history analysis of national incident CKD populations to examine in-depth racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes and processes of care over the full course of CKD. Our central hypothesis is that differences in mortality between minorities (AAs and Hispanics) and whites are time-dependent over the course of CKD, and that differences in ESRD are related to the differences in pre-ESRD, which result from differential survival-selection processes between the groups. The analyses proposed under our three Specific Aims will test this and other specific hypotheses and examine a range of factors for the differential survival selections, particularly the processes of care. Aim 1 will yield a detailed characterization of how racial/ethnic differences in mortality evolve over the full course of CKD. Aim 2 will examine the effect of processes of care on differential survival selections among racial/ethnic groups, which drives the time-dependent changes found in Aim 1. Aim 3 will assess the role of unexplained risks in these differential survival-selection processes. In addition to our novel hypotheses and innovative analytic approaches, this study will foster methodological advances in CKD research, which include the use of 1) two national incident CKD cohorts with >15 years of follow-up that connect the pre-ESRD and ESRD periods—the national veteran CKD population (>1.3 million) for primary analyses, and the Medicare CKD population (>790,000) for further understanding of processes of care across the nation; and 2) advanced statistical techniques, including time-dependent multi-state survival models and frailty models. This study will offer novel understanding of why differential survival rates among AAs and Hispanics vs. whites exist and how they can be addressed. Our results for real-world processes of care among AAs and Hispanics can be directly translated into actionable initiatives to enhance care for minority CKD patients. Building on our team's outstanding record, we anticipate that our efforts will continue to be novel, productive and highly impactful. . Project Narrative Racial/ethnic disparities have persisted in multiple aspects of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end- stage renal disease (ESRD), from processes and quality of care to incidence of ESRD and outcomes. We will perform event-history analyses of large incident CKD cohorts to critically examine the causes of the racial/ethnic disparities along the entire spectrum from pre-ESRD to ESRD. Understanding the sources of these disparities will serve to minimize them and improve the care of minority patients with CKD/ESRD.",Differential survival selections and care-related determinants among African Americans and Hispanics versus whites with chronic kidney disease,9447866,R01DK112008,"['Affect ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Incidence ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Fostering ', ' Event History Analyses ', ' Event History Analysis ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' data structure ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2018,372470,0.06635156912009489
"Building Capacity for Chronic Kidney Disease Research in Guatemala. PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic kidney disease is a growing problem globally, where it now affects more than 10% of the population. In low- and middle-income countries, there is limited data on the actual scope of the problem, however, since it is difficult to obtain reliable estimates of rates of chronic kidney disease for the population, especially in rural or underserved communities. This project will take place in Guatemala, which is a Central American country with a rising rate of chronic kidney disease. Guatemala also has large rural and indigenous Maya populations, and virtually nothing is known about the burden of chronic kidney disease in those populations. This information gap is important for several reasons. One reason is that the indigenous population suffers from very high rates of stunting (short stature), which we hypothesize may be an important risk for developing chronic kidney disease, especially when combined with other traditional risk factors like diabetes or obesity. Another reason is that a surge in kidney disease of uncertain cause (called “nontraditional” chronic kidney disease) is occurring among young agricultural workers along the Pacific Coast of Guatemala, which appears to be unrelated to diabetes, high blood pressure, or the other usual risk factors that cause kidney disease. In this project, we will take a random sample of adults from two different Guatemalan towns: one with a high proportion of indigenous Maya and a high rate of stunting, one with a low proportion of indigenous Maya but located in the part of Guatemala where the surge in kidney disease of unknown cause is occurring. We will measure the rates of kidney disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes in these samples. We will also ask questions of each individual about potential exposures and causes of kidney disease. Statistical analysis of this data will allow us to determine the rate of chronic kidney disease in each town, estimate ethnic disparities (indigenous vs nonindigenous) in chronic kidney disease, and explore potential causes of both traditional kidney disease (such as diabetes or stunting) and nontraditional kidney disease. This project represents a concerted effort on the part of our respective institutions in Guatemala and the United States to bridge the “urban-rural divide” in chronic kidney disease, providing for the first time high- quality, systematic data from rural Guatemala on the impact of this important illness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Chronic kidney disease affects more than 10% of the population globally, however in many low- and middle- income countries we lack information on the precise causes and impact of the disease. Guatemala is a Central American country experiencing a rapid increase in the rate of both traditional chronic disease (associated with risk factors like diabetes) and nontraditional kidney disease (typically occurring in younger adults).

"Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to transplant are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the transplant process. In 2014, our SEKTx Coalition conducted a randomized, multicomponent intervention (Reducing Disparities In Access to kidNey Transplantation [RaDIANT]) Community Study in GA, the state with the lowest kidney transplant rates in the nation, consisting of patient- and provider-focused educational and engagement interventions designed to increase referral for transplant evaluation among AA ESRD patients. This study was effective in improving referral for kidney transplantation among AA in GA, but efforts to improve access to kidney transplantation must be expanded beyond GA and should include interventions targeting steps beyond referral to the medical evaluation at the transplant center. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to eliminate racial disparities in every step of the kidney transplant process. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine reasons for racial disparities in medical evaluation for kidney transplantation among dialysis patients in GA, NC and SC. Specific Aim 2: Implement the RaDIANT Regional Study in GA, NC, and SC with the goal of increasing rates of referral, medical evaluation, and waitlisting, and reducing disparities in these key steps. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a process and outcome evaluation of the RaDIANT Regional Study interventions. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant access among the AA ESRD population in the Southeast and reduce health disparities in transplantation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of kidney disease is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. The proposed study seeks to leverage an existing academic-community collaboration with the Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention targeting End Stage Renal Disease patients and dialysis facility staff in reducing racial disparities in access t kidney transplantation.",Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study,9581300,U01MD010611,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Maintenance ', ' North Carolina ', ' parity ', ' Patient advocacy ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Facility Controls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' quality improvement organization ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' volunteer ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' surveillance data ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' intervention cost ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,71960,0.13970851774364518
"Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The best treatment for kidney failure is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), which provides an average of 10 additional years of life compared to staying on chronic dialysis. Unfortunately, large racial/ethnic disparities persist in receipt of LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics comprise over 58 percent of all dialysis patients but receive less than 28 percent of LDKTs. A little-studied and likely crucial cause of LDKT disparities is the lower likelihood that Black and Hispanic donor volunteers (persons interested in donating a live kidney) will complete the multi-step donor evaluation and actually donate. While minority donor volunteers are more likely to have medical contraindications to donation, they are also much more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation or decline participation in paired exchange (programs that permit LDKT using immunologically incompatible donor-recipient pairs). Based upon limited prior research, the outcomes of the donor evaluation may be especially affected by several potentially modifiable individual and health care system factors, such as donor volunteers' motivation to donate, health literacy, knowledge/education about donation, satisfaction with the patient care experience, and socioeconomic barriers to donation. These factors, however, have not been prospectively examined in a well-powered, multi-center, and diverse cohort of donor volunteers. The objective of this study is to determine how differences in modifiable individual and system factors are associated with Black and Hispanic donor volunteers' lower likelihood of actually donating. Our overall hypothesis is that donor volunteers who are Black or Hispanic are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, due to modifiable differences that either (1) are already present at the start of the evaluation, o (2) arise later in the evaluation process. To test this hypothesis, we propose a sequential mixed methods study. First, we will perform qualitative interviews of donor volunteers who previously discontinued their donor evaluations, to identify all the potentially modifiable causes of discontinuation of the donor evaluation (Aim 1). Then, in the quantitative component, we will perform a prospective cohort study of 2,800 live kidney donor volunteers at two large transplant centers in New Jersey and California. Among 575 Black, 875 Hispanic, and 1,350 White donor volunteers, we will determine differences in potentially modifiable factors that are present at the start of the donor evaluation (Aim 2) or arise during the evaluation (Aim 3), and also determine the impact of modifiable factors upon successful completion of the donor evaluation (Aim 4) and actual donation, directly or via paired exchange (Aim 5). At the end of this study, we will understand how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their potentially modifiable social, behavioral, and health services characteristics and how these factors impact both completion of the evaluation and actual donation. Our results, generalizable to the 230+ kidney transplant centers in the U.S., will enable us to design future interventions to improve the education, support, and care of live donor volunteers, to ultimately decrease racial/ethnic disparities in LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For patients with kidney failure, the best treatment option is usually a live donor kidney transplant (LDKT), but Blacks and Hispanics with kidney failure are much less likely to receive LDKTs. Blacks and Hispanics may receive fewer LDKTs because their live donor volunteers are more likely to discontinue the donor evaluation, possibly due to modifiable reasons. This study will examine how Black, Hispanic, and White live donor volunteers differ in their motivation, education, perceptions of care, and socioeconomic barriers to donation, and how these potentially modifiable factors impact whether donor volunteers successfully complete evaluation and actually donate.",Modifiable factors affecting racial disparities in live kidney donation,9456530,R01MD007664,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' New Jersey ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Saints ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' volunteer ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIMHD,ST.

"Wake Forest Collaborative Application for an APOLLO Clinical Center We are applying to participate as an APOLLO Clinical Center in this national prospective study. The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all U.S. kidney transplantations from African American donors to determine their effects on transplant outcomes. In addition, the health of living African American kidney donors will be assessed. Information that was lacking from prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. Our investigative team, led by two PIs with complementary expertise, has led the way in clinical trials to address the marked disparities in African Americans with end-stage kidney disease. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute. These renal-risk variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease. In contrast, these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may prove to be clinically useful in those with recent African ancestry in the setting of allocation of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and assessment of prospective living kidney donors. Genotypic information (precision medicine) may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. Information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation. However, before these genotypic data can be used in the clinical setting, a prospective national study is required to evaluate kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from prior retrospective studies will be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. This is the rationale and setting for the current APOLLO trial. In this important multi-site study, our site will work closely with the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center and the other participating sites to recruit and prospectively follow eligible kidney donors and transplant recipients based on the APOLLO protocol. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors; reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that donors having kidney disease risk variants in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene may contribute. This APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center application is designed to prospectively evaluate effects of donor and recipient APOL1 genotypes in kidney transplantations performed at 20 affiliated transplant programs. Results from our Center, as part of the national APOLLO study, could help transform organ allocation and informed consent in kidney transplantation, optimize survival of patients after kidney transplantation, and determine the safety of living kidney donation.",Wake Forest Collaborative Application for an APOLLO Clinical Center,9767961,U01DK116040,"['Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Creatinine ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Illinois ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nephrology ', ' North Carolina ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Work ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Failure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Antibody titer measurement ', ' antibody titering ', ' Allografting ', ' Outcome Study ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Vital Status ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Aliquot ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' delayed graft function ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' implantation ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' high risk ', ' organ allocation ', ' pre-implantation ', ' preimplantation ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' academic program ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2018,84825,0.17609933971647945
"Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium Summary/Abstract Data demonstrate that transplanted kidneys from African American (AA) deceased donors are associated with reduced survival relative to kidneys from non-AA donors. Additional data demonstrate that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants, that are found exclusively in AA individuals, have been associated with an increased risk of CKD/ESRD in the general AA population. Two risk variants of this gene have a prevalence of 13% in AAs, and may account for some or all of the increased risk of transplant loss. There are also anecdotal reports of AA living kidney donors with two APOL1 risk variants developing ESRD raising further concerns. The APOLLO study proposes to enroll all deceased and living AA kidney donors in order to definitively address the impact of APOL1 variants on kidney transplant outcomes. The Emory APOLLO Clinical Centers consortium is comprised of 12 centers distributed across the US but focused in the Southeast. In 2015 these 12 programs transplanted 219 kidneys from deceased and living AA donors accounting for about 9% of all recipients of AA kidneys, the eligible study cohort in the US. The specific aims of our consortium are: (1) to perform APOL1 genotyping on all AA deceased and living kidney donors and create a sample repository for future studies to determine whether additional genetic factors contribute to the second hit postulated to be required for risk manifestation, (2) to compare the survival and function of all transplanted kidneys from AA donors to determine the impact of two APOL1 risk variants on transplant outcomes as well as exploring the potential of environmental factors (rejection, infections, comorbid conditions such as hypertension) to provide the second hit, and 3) to study whether African American living donors who carry two copies of the variant APOL1 genes are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease. Blood samples for APOL1 genotyping of deceased donors will be provided by the organ procurement organization, while the transplant centers will provide blood for genotyping recipients and living donors (as well as deceased donors when necessary). Demographic and clinical donor and recipient data will be provided by UNOS for all subjects. More granular clinical data will be provided for patients receiving their long-term follow up from one the 12 participating transplant centers. We propose enrolling subjects for 1 year and following them for 3 years thereby maximizing the likelihood of observing clinical events. The primary outcome measure for recipients of deceased donor kidneys is graft survival with secondary outcome measures assessing a variety of indicators of renal function and injury. As advance CKD or ESRD following living kidney donation are highly unlikely events, given the relatively short study duration the primary outcome for living kidney donors will be the change in renal function from the post-transplant baseline to the end of follow up at 3 years post-donation. When combined with the data from the other 14 APOLLO Clinical Center Consortia, we believe our data will contribute to a much more complete understanding of the impact of APOL1 gene variants on the outcomes of kidney transplantation and donation. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE STATEMENT: This study will improve the public health by determining if transplanted kidneys from African American donors who have two specific copies of variants of the apolipoprotein L1 gene (called APOL1) fail more rapidly than kidneys donated by African Americans without two variant copies of these genes. Should this study confirm the negative impact of the variant APOL1 genes this information would be very helpful for transplant professionals counseling patients in need of kidney transplantation about the benefits and risks of accepting a kidney transplant from a donor with two variant copies of APOL1 versus waiting for a transplant from a different donor at a later time. This study will also determine whether otherwise healthy African American patients who have these genes can safely be living kidney donors, or whether the presence of the two APOL gene variants increases their risk of kidney disease so much that they cannot safely donate.",Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium,9767957,U01DK116099,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood donor ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Injury ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' uroplakin III ', ' Uroplakin 3A ', ' Uroplakin 3 ', ' UPK3A ', ' UPK3 ', ' UPIIIA ', ' UP3 ', ' UPK3 gene ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Allografting ', ' Inferior ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' hazard ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' graft failure ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' sharing data ', ' Regimen ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' imaging study ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,84825,0.1788708586833125
"Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhancing CKD health: Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2) trial Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities with respect to prevalence and clinical outcomes. Measures such as glycemic control in persons with diabetes, blood pressure control, and reduction of proteinuria with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can help delay CKD decline and decrease CKD-associated morbidity and mortality; however, many individuals with CKD are not benefiting from these scientific advances. This lack of translation may be due in part to very low levels of CKD awareness among providers and patients leading to inadequate primary care provider self-efficacy for delivery of CKD care and poor patient engagement to participate in healthy lifestyles and adhere to medication regimens. To address this need, our multi-disciplinary team has developed and piloted two interventions that increasing awareness among providers and patients and translate that knowledge into more optimal CKD care. The provider intervention is a CKD registry tailored to the entire healthcare team that provides point-of-care decision support regarding CKD management and outside-of care summaries of CKD relevant clinical data to optimize delivery of guideline-concordant CKD care via outreach and population health. The patient intervention is a comprehensive self-management support program that includes low-literacy educational materials, linguistically/culturally tailored automated telephone self-management support (CKD-ATSM), health coaching, and reminder text messages. Our team has successfully piloted both interventions in a pilot feasibility study (NCT01530958) in one academic clinic that serves a low-income, multilingual population. We have since refined the interventions to integrate the registry with the electronic medical record and to include mobile texting in the self-management program. We are now poised to study the effectiveness of the refined interventions on health outcomes among a large diverse, low-income population using the Chronic Care Model framework of health care delivery. We propose a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial entitled Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2), in which we will randomize 60 providers and 400 patients with CKD in 6 federally qualified community health centers to receive the provider intervention (CKD registry) or usual care and the patient self- management support intervention (CKD-ATSM) or usual care. We will assess the impact of the provider intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 1); the patient intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 2); and their interaction (Aim 3) on patient-level clinical outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, CKD decline); provider behavioral outcomes (e.g., provider self-efficacy for CKD management); and patient behavioral outcomes (e.g., CKD awareness, participation in self-management behavior). If one or both KARE-2 interventions are effective at improving health among high-risk patients, they can be disseminated to other delivery systems to change the way CKD care is delivered in the US, leading to reductions in CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities.

"Increasing Equity in Transplant Evaluation and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). But, the evaluation process for a kidney transplant is lengthy, time consuming, and burdensome to the patient. Also, race disparities exist in rates of transplant evaluation completion, transplantation, and LDKT. Our previous and ongoing NIDDK-funded research indicates that cultural factors (i.e., perceived discrimination in health care, religious objection to LDKT), transplant knowledge, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, education, income) independently and significantly predict time to complete transplant evaluation. In December 2012 our transplant center implemented a one-day streamlined evaluation process, dubbed Kidney Transplant Fast Track (KTFT), but it has not been evaluated for efficacy or cost effectiveness. Thus, we propose a quasi-experiment to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the KTFT (n=1030) compared to historical controls (n=1140) who were recruited for our current NIDDK study to increase transplant rates. At the same time, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting vulnerable patients with the educational component of the TALK intervention (Talking About Live Kidney Donation) to increase LDKT. For both components of the application, we will target vulnerable populations because they are most at risk for extended evaluation times and lower rates of LDKT. Using CONSORT standards, participants will be randomly assigned to TALK (n=515) versus no-TALK (n=515) conditions and undergo two interviews at pre-transplant work-up and at completion of transplant evaluation in order to: (1) test whether KTFT and TALK will reduce transplant evaluation time, and increase rates of transplant and LDKT in members of vulnerable groups; (2) determine whether engaging in a streamlined and coordinated-care evaluation experience within the transplant center reduces negative perceptions of the healthcare system; and (3) test the cost effectiveness of the KTFT with TALK relative to standard practices. The results of this two-pronged approach will help pave the way for other transplant centers to implement a Fast Track system at their sites, improve quality of care by transplanting a larger number of vulnerable patients, and may help address stark race/ethnic disparities in rates of LDKT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority patients are more likely than whites to have end stage kidney disease (ESKD), but less likely to complete transplant evaluation, receive a kidney transplant (KT) overall, or a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), the best treatment for ESKD. We will test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of a comprehensive, system-level Fast Track kidney transplant evaluation for minorities in reducing time to complete transplant evaluation and increase KT. And, using a randomized-controlled trial, we will test the effectiveness of an educational video and booklet to encourage discussion and pursuit of LDKT. Findings from this work may help reduce disparities in transplant evaluation and LDKT.",Increasing Equity in Transplant Evaluation and Living Donor Kidney Transplantation,9543472,R01DK101715,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Work ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Reporting ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' transplant centers ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,531078,0.17311313284328367
"The effect of socioeconomic status and environment characteristics on disparate postdonation health outcomes between Black and White living kidney donors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Each year in the US, 6000+ healthy individuals donate a kidney to a loved one, friend or stranger amounting to 142,111 individuals who have donated since 1988. For these healthy individuals, live donor nephrectomy is associated with a 25-40% decline in renal function, which increases their risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, recent evidence suggests that Black living kidney donors are at an even higher risk of these long-term morbidities than White donors. The 15-year postdonation risk of ESRD for Black donors is 154 per 10,000 compared to 49 per 10,000 for White donors. While compelling evidence points to genetic risk factors as key components of this difference, a substantial knowledge gap exists regarding the contribution of socioeconomic status (SES) and local environment of donors. Routine postdonation follow-up and care management could potentially identify early events on the pathway to CKD and ESRD – including diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN) and glomerulonephritis (GN) as these conditions are easily detected with routine vital signs, and blood and urine tests. Our group recently reported that only 50% of transplant hospitals achieve the mandated, routine follow-up for their donors. Further, follow- up attrition is associated with donors that are young, black, male, uninsured, and with fewer years of education. It is possible that socioeconomic and local environment disadvantage may potentiate follow-up attrition and increase rate of progression to CKD/ESRD in an already genetically at risk population. To better understand the impact of SES and environment on post-donation CKD/ESRD, we will leverage a major, ongoing, R01-funded, multicenter study that uses survey data linked to administrative databases to address the following aims: (1) To characterize the SES and local environment resources of Black vs. White living kidney donors; (2) To quantify the postdonation risk of CKD/ESRD attributable to low SES and disadvantaged environments; and (3) To examine health behavior of Black vs. White donors according to SES and environment. These aims are highly feasible given the rich primary data collection of parent study. We hypothesize that Black and White donors with low SES and from disadvantaged environments will have a higher incidence of postdonation DM, HTN, GN and CKD/ESRD. If the proposed aims are achieved, we will have a better understanding of which variables modify the relationship between race and outcomes and at what threshold of social disadvantage a difference is observed. It could also change clinical practice by 1) informing personalized follow-up care plans based on donor social circumstances, and (2) preventing exclusion of disadvantaged populations from national-based monitoring interventions.

"Cleveland Precision Medicine Chronic Kidney Disease Cohort Project Abstract Although hypertension is associated with ~25% of end-stage renal disease (H-ESRD) in the United States, the pathogenic mechanisms that drive the initiation and progression of hypertension-associated chronic kidney disease (HTN-CKD) are unclear. The incidence of H-ESRD is 4- to 5-fold greater in African American populations than in whites. To address this health disparity, the Cleveland KPMP Recruiting Network will recruit a cohort of CKD patients with HTN-CKD. Prospective participants with CKD stage 3a will be identified by automated, scheduled queries of the electronic health records (EHR) of two large health care delivery systems in Cleveland, OH, the Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth. Eligible candidates will be enriched for subjects likely to progress by using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation to identify individuals with > 15% probability of developing ESRD in 5 years. This Network plans enrollment of 10 participants each year during the two year UG3 exploratory phase and 40 to 50 subjects each year for the subsequent, three year UH3 implementation phase. Once kidney research biopsy safety is established in UG3, HTN-CKD subject inclusion criteria in UH3 will be modified to include proteinuric CKD Stage 2 patients. Subjects with other CKD phenotypes can be recruited to support consortium goals. After informed consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a baseline MRI to image kidney structure and a research kidney biopsy and then be followed every 6 months at standard of care visits for the duration of the KPMP. Baseline and longitudinal biosamples will be collected and linked through REDCap to clinical data in the EHRs. The Network plans to obtain additional healthy and disease kidney samples from living donor kidney implant biopsies and an additional tissue core obtained at an indication biopsy from HTN-CKD patients, respectively. Clinical data, biopsy blocks and biosamples will be submitted to Central Hub repositories. The Network includes a Community Partnership Committee composed of CKD patients and families, physicians and an ethicist to guide implementation of this KPMP Network. In anticipation of Opportunity Pool funding, the PIs have recruited co-investigators, who will utilize the rich KPMP molecular, radiologic and histopathologic phenotypes and longitudinal clinical data for discovery. Since excess risk in African Americans for HTN-CKD is largely explained by genetic variations in APOL1, our initial research goal in UH3 is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this association. We will integrate molecular and clinical phenotypes with visual and subvisual morphologic descriptors to discover the cells and associated molecular pathways mediating APOL1-associated HTN-CKD. In pilot, proof- of-principle studies, we used computational methods and identified a set of sub-visual morphologic features that discriminated 10 African American kidney transplant implant biopsies with high risk APOL1 genotypes from 6 implant biopsies with low risk APOL1 genotypes. Creative strategies that integrate KPMP datasets will define other research questions to identify biologic pathways driving CKD and result in new CKD therapies. Project Narrative Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) affect over 20 million Americans, but their causes are poorly understood and CKD often worsens despite treatment. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) will recruit adults from around the United States for a research kidney biopsy and long term follow-up in order to discover causes of CKD and improve outcomes and care of CKD patients. The Cleveland KPMP Recruiting Network will enroll individuals with mild to moderate kidney injury attributed to high blood pressure and collect their kidney tissue; blood, urine and stool samples; and de-identified health information. Working with KPMP scientists, together we will improve diagnosis and treatment of CKD in order to stop or reverse kidney damage, which often results in death or need for dialysis for CKD

"Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for kidney transplantation continues to exceed the supply. Increasing the number of living kidney donors is a major priority. Historically, living donors were healthy and free of isolated medical abnormalities (IMA) at the time of donation. Recently, general US population demographics have changed, and in response, transplant centers now include donors with IMAs such as pre-hypertension (pre-HTN), obesity, and metabolic syndrome. At a general population level, individuals with IMAs, particularly African Americans (AA), are more likely to develop comorbidities, such as diabetes, HTN, and chronic kidney disease. Recent data suggest that AA living kidney donors are more likely to have a pre-donation IMA. It remains unclear what impact, if any, living donation will have on development of these comorbidities, and whether racial disparities in risk attributable to donation exist. Current methods for assessing living donor long-term health risks are imprecise, relying heavily on traditional factors such as family and social histories. Morphometric measures (e.g. vascular calcifications; fat distribution), using radiologic imaging, have emerged as strong predictors of cardiovascular risk. Pre-donation imaging, routinely acquired during donor evaluations to assess renal anatomy, can be leveraged to identify novel morphometric risk predictors for post-donation comorbidities. I hypothesize that morphometric measures will greatly improve prediction of post-donation comorbidities, including risk directly attributable to donation. Given significant knowledge gaps in risk prediction and stratification of donors with IMAs, I propose an ancillary study that will leverage data from an ongoing R01-funded cohort study of live donors to create the largest cohort of IMA donors studied and will address unique aims: (1) explore the association of novel morphometric measures and traditional risk factors with post-donation comorbidity stratified by race; (2) develop a risk tool for predicting post-donation comorbidities; and (3) estimate risk attributable to living kidney donation. Utilization o novel morphometric measures obtained from routine pre- donation imaging is innovative, highly practical, and will create a level of risk prediction of living donor outcomes that currently does not exist. Precise risk prediction will improve informed consent, donor autonomy in medical decision making, and will change the practice of live kidney donor selection in the US. Resources and infrastructure at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, including the most AA living kidney donors in the US, are keenly in-line with the proposed aims, and will provide the necessary foundation to see the proposed project to its successful completion. The mentored award will foster my growth as an independent investigator by affording me opportunities to focus on building an expertise in novel risk prediction research and enhancing my exposure to health disparities and chronic disease epidemiology in minority populations. This additional training will inform my path toward long-term career goals of research independence as a surgeon-scientist and R01 funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the demand for kidneys continues to exceed the supply, transplant centers have begun to relax selection criteria to include living donors with obesity and/or high blood pressure. Expansion of selection criteria has occurred despite a paucity of supporting safety data. It is critical to balance increasing live donation for transplant candidate against the responsibility of understanding long-term risks specific to donors at the extremes of current selection criteria for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care.",Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities,9478161,K23DK103918,"['Alabama ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Award ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Family ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Event-Free Survival ', ' Disease-Free Survival ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Vascular calcification ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Categories ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Stratification ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' prehypertension ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive tools ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' radiological imaging ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2018,179553,0.1640769313831251
"Racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation. PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Kidney transplantation is the preferred modality of treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as it improves quality of life and survival for patients with ESRD. However, racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation are present in adults and children with chronic kidney disease. The lower access of black and Hispanic adults to kidney transplant has been ascribed to late referral for nephrology care, delayed referral for transplant evaluation, lower socioeconomic status, and differences in cultural beliefs or attitudes surrounding organ transplantation. However, the fact that similar racial and ethnic disparities are also present in children (who have better access to healthcare than adults, and for whom transplantation is the standard ESRD treatment modality) suggests that there may be additional barriers that contribute to these disparities. For example, some studies have suggested that chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses more rapidly in black and Hispanic patients, which could shorten the time available for transplant evaluation, waitlisting, and preemptive surgery during the advanced stages of CKD (prior to dialysis). In addition, since obesity is more prevalent in racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, and most transplant centers have body mass index criterion for transplantation and kidney donation, this policy may disproportionately disadvantage black or Hispanic recipients despite the absence of solid evidence that long-term allograft outcomes are worse in obese recipients. Donor perceptions regarding their own health, or transplant center's assessment of donor suitability, may also differ by donor race or ethnicity. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to evaluate disparities in transplant access in both adults and children within the context of medical risk factors (and policies surrounding these risk factors) that may disadvantage black or Hispanic patients, compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. In Aim 1, we propose to examine whether there are differences in the time spent in the advanced stages of CKD (stage 4 or 5) by race or ethnicity (when evaluation for waitlisting or transplantation typically occurs) using individual level data from four national CKD cohorts. In Aim 2, we propose to evaluate how body mass index may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in access to transplantation or suitability for kidney donation using data from the United States Renal Data System (recipients) and University of California San Francisco [UCSF] (donors). In Aim 3, we propose to establish a prospective study of potential living kidney donors to compare donor perceptions of their health with objective measures of donor risk and the transplant center's perception of donor suitability by race and ethnicity. UCSF is well-suited for the conduct of this proposal, given that it is one of the largest transplant centers in the US, performing 300-350 kidney transplants (including about 150 living donor transplants) annually. Our study will inform whether policy changes are needed to improve parity in access to kidney transplantation and will facilitate the design of additional strategies to enhance organ donation among racial and ethnic minorities.

"Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media Summary Over 90,000 individuals in the United States await kidney transplantation. Only about 12,000 will receive a deceased donor transplant each year, and recent efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, most candidates on the waiting list have a higher chance of dying than of being offered a deceased donor kidney. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) eliminates the wait and offers superior survival, but accounts for fewer than 6,000 additional transplants per year despite a huge potential pool of millions of adults living in the US. Worse, LDKT rates are lowest among Hispanic and African American candidates who account for over 30% of the waitlist. Regardless of race, known barriers to identifying a live donor include lack of education, reluctance to discuss one's illness, and hesitance to ask others to donate. We have developed two novel interventions to address these barriers. The first is a 6-month training program that combines education, advocacy, and instrumental support by pairing candidates with a live donor champion (LDC): a friend, family member, or community member trained to spread awareness of ESRD, LDKT, and the candidate's story throughout their social network. The second is a less-intensive Facebook (FB) app (designed in collaboration with FB leadership) that leverages the broad reach of social media to spread awareness, facilitating FB posts about the candidate's story, providing links to education about ESRD and LDKT, and documenting the candidate's search for a donor through a ""chronically viral"" Facebook story. In pilot studies at our center, participants of both interventions were significantly more likely to undergo LDKT compared to matched controls. While encouraging, pilot testing has been non-randomized and limited to our center and its unique patient population. Furthermore, it remains unclear how intense an intervention is necessary, i.e. the less-intense FB approach or the more-intense champion approach. To assess the real- world effectiveness of the LDC program and/or the Facebook app in expanding live donation among a heterogeneous population of waitlist candidates, we now propose to test these interventions at three busy transplant centers that serve a heterogeneous group of largely underserved patients. The relative dearth of deceased donors has caused a profound organ shortage; it is essential to turn to novel efforts that increase live donation. Development and widespread implementation of culturally competent LDC and Facebook App interventions has the potential to increase the overall incidence of LDKT while also addressing disparities in access to LDKT.   Public Health Relevance There is a crisis in the United States with over 100,000 people on the transplant waitlist. Efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful so we must now turn to living donation to confront the shortage. Barriers to increasing living donation are largely due to communication, thus we look to novel interventions using social media and social networks to address the problem. Pilot programs with these interventions have proven successful at our center and we now wish to test dissemination to other centers, especially those caring for some of our most underserved patients.",Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media,9451284,R01DK111966,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Awareness ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Leadership ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Friends ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Organ ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' social media ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,549943,0.14033710212403408
"A Culturally Targeted Transplant Program to Increase Live Donation in Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The shortage of organs for kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is magnified in Hispanics/Latin Americans. Hispanics have a disproportionately higher prevalence of ESRD, yet receive fewer kidney transplants compared to non-Hispanic whites. Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the treatment of choice for ESRD as it confers better patient and graft survival, shorter waiting time, and better quality of life than deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, compared to their representation on the waiting list, fewer Hispanics received a LDKT than non-Hispanic whites in 2013: 4 percent versus 10 percent. Barriers to LDKT for Hispanics include: lack of knowledge, cultural concerns, and language barriers. The disparity will likely worsen without intervention as Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the US.  Few available culturally competent interventions have led to increased LDKT rates. Interventions rarely address Hispanic cultural concerns, and there are no published models of transplant center-based only programs. The Chicago Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program (HKTP), a culturally and linguistically competent program, has increased Hispanic LDKTs. The mean annual ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs grew from 0.20 in 2001-2006 to 0.34 in 2008-2013, a 70 percent increase (p<0.001).  The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the HKTP, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations (Dallas, TX, and Los Angeles, CA), with Northwestern University serving as the Study Coordinating Center. The pre-post HKTP intervention study will evaluate the effect of the HKTP's key culturally sensitive components (outreach, communication, education) on Hispanic LDKT rates, compared to matched controls. The specific aims are to:  1. Implement the HKTP at two transplant centers by conducting a needs assessment of barriers and using a ""learning collaborative"" model to deliver HKTP protocols, scripts, and materials.  2. Conduct a pre-post HKTP intervention evaluation with matched controls to assess if the HKTP is associated with an increase in: a) the ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs as a function of an absolute increase in Hispanic LDKTs, b) ESRD Hispanic patient additions to the waiting list, c) Hispanic potential donors per potential recipient, and d) Hispanic patients' satisfaction with care.  3. Formatively evaluate the fidelity and innovative adaptations to HKTP's outreach, communication, and education at both study sites to identify effective components of the HTKP, using mixed methods.  As an exploratory aim, a budget impact analysis will be conducted to construct a business case for transplant centers and permit estimates of HKTP scalability. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally, improve health outcomes for Hispanics, and close the LDKT disparity gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic/Latino patients with end-stage renal disease are disproportionately less likely to get a kidney transplant, and specifically, a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, without LDKTs, Hispanics experience longer transplant waiting times, shorter patient and graft survival, and worse quality of life. Cultural beliefs and linguistic barriers contribute to the disparity in LDKTs. The objectie of the proposed study is to implement and evaluate Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations.

"Mentored patient-oriented research in disparities in cardiovascular and kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Gutiérrez is an Associate Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, Section Head of Outcomes and Epidemiology research in the Division of Nephrology, and Medical Director of the Bionutrition Unit in the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The long- term scientific goal of Dr. Gutiérrez is to build a patient-oriented research (POR) program focused on identifying novel strategies for reducing or eliminating disparities in health outcomes related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In order to accomplish this goal, Dr. Gutiérrez recognizes the critical importance of mentoring the next generation of clinician scientists who can develop the necessary expertise to investigate root causes of disparities in a comprehensive and ethical manner. However, the increasing demands on his time related to sustaining his professional effort for research as well as administrative and supervisory commitments pose a challenge towards his ability to grow his mentorship activities. This award will ensure Dr. Gutiérrez maintains the protected time to focus on POR related to disparities in CVD and CKD, a central component of which will involve mentoring junior investigators. His trainees will receive comprehensive training in POR centered on three main projects which focus on (1) the role of disordered mineral metabolism, (2) nutrition, (3) and novel pathways of kidney injury in explaining racial differences in CVD and CKD outcomes. This activities will be coupled with a robust program to enhance his skills as a mentor, with the ultimate goal of producing well-trained investigators committed to POR focused on disparities in health outcomes.

"The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD ABSTRACT: Racial inequalities in kidney and end stage renal diseases (ESRD) have been well-documented and are independent of lower socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education), lower access to care, or other conventional risk factors. Research has identified numerous genetic risk factors of renal disease, particularly the APOL1 variants occurring in persons of African descent. However, these genetic factors primarily increase susceptibility, requiring other factors for the development of disease. A growing body of research indicates the importance of neighborhoods for health and health inequalities. Unequal neighborhood contexts may be an important and largely unexplored determinant of the increased kidney disease risk experienced by Blacks compared to Whites. In fact, neighborhood context may interact with genetic susceptibility to result in kidney disease inequalities. Clarifying the role of neighborhood is important as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring. They develop and change through policies and are thus amenable to intervention. Despite the evidence indicating the importance of neighborhoods for the major risk factors and determinants of kidney disease, there is a dearth of empirical research on the role of neighborhoods in relation to kidney disease itself, particularly at pre-ESRD stages. The primary challenges to research in this area are: (a) the lack of skilled researchers with training in both social science and the pathophysiology and genetic science of kidney disease; and (b) the paucity of datasets that contain high quality neighborhood and clinical and genetic measures. To reach my long-term career goal to become a successful, independent researcher who clarifies the social causes and genetic and biomedical mechanisms of racial CKD inequalities, I will address the current scientific challenges through the proposed training and research, respectively by: (a) complementing my early work in the biological sciences and extensive training in the social sciences with extensive training in the pathophysiology and genetics of kidney disease; and (b) creating state-of-the-art neighborhood measures to existing datasets with high quality repeat clinical measures of renal function and damage. I will address three career goals:  1. To obtain formal training in renal physiology and pathophysiology.  2. To develop expertise in genetic epidemiology and population genetics pertaining to racial inequalities in  kidney disease.  3. To take the first step toward independence through an R01 submission. My training will include mentorship and collaboration with leading experts in the genetics and pathophysiology of CKD inequalities, formal coursework in genetic epidemiology, statistical/population genetics, and renal physiology/pathophysiology, and multiple conferences and workshops on the substantive topics of genetics, race, and CKD and on professional development. Through my research project, I will use three cohorts (Health and Retirement Study, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network) to examine the interactive associations between multiple measures of four neighborhood domains (racial residential segregation, social environment, built environment, and health care resources) and genetic risk (APOL1 and β-globin HBB genotypes, adjusting for genetic ancestry), as follows:  Aim 1: Link state-of-the-art measures of four domains of neighborhood context to population-representative,  epidemiological, and clinical cohort datasets containing markers of kidney disease.  Aim 2: Examine longitudinal associations between neighborhood context and renal health, with adjustment  for genetic ancestry and APOL1 genotype.  Aim 3: Examine the modifying role of neighborhood context on longitudinal associations between APOL1  high-risk genotype status and renal health. With this training and dataset creation, I will then clarify the neighborhood characteristics that are most tightly linked to renal outcomes both directly and through their interactions with genetic risk loci. This research will set a solid foundation for research on neighborhood characteristics and inequalities in kidney disease. Not only will this research clarify the interdependent roles of neighborhood and genetic risk on these inequalities, but it will identify key neighborhood characteristics, which are amenable to change, related to kidney disease within and between racial groups. UM is the ideal venue for my training and research as it is internationally recognized as a leading research institution that strongly supports interdisciplinary science. I joined the faculty both at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) because of its commitment to interdisciplinary research, and Nephrology because of its commitment to clarifying the social exposures that contribute to kidney disease. Within ISR, the Nephrology Division, and School of Public Health, I will acquire rigorous training and develop solid collaborations devoted to the clarification of the social and genetic causes of racial inequalities in CKD. NARRATIVE: Racial inequalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been well-documented but are not well-understood. Recent research suggests an important role for genetics such as the high risk variants of the gene, APOL1, encoding the apolipoprotein L1, present only in persons of African descent. However, research also points to neighborhoods as an important source of health inequalities and clarifying its role is critical as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring and are amenable to change. In fact, it may be that neighborhood environments may result in CKD through their interaction with genetic susceptibility. Using three complementary cohorts, I will examine the interactive effects between specific neighborhood characteristics and APOL1 on longitudinal measures of CKD.",The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD,9494564,K01DK106322,"['Apolipoproteins ', ' beta Globin ', ' β-globin ', ' B-globin ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Censuses ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Science of genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Mentorship ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nephrotic Syndrome ', ' Physiology ', ' Privatization ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' African ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' built environment ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,152940,0.03983428540338788
"A Pilot Feasibility Trial of Thyroid Hormone Replacement in Dialysis Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Three decades of research have shown a disproportionate prevalence of hypothyroidism (~25%) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, including those receiving dialysis. While hypothyroidism has been associated with heightened cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in the general population, there had previously been a paucity of data on its prognostic implications in CKD. During the first 2¼ years of the parent K23 award, Dr. Connie Rhee (PI) has published pioneering studies showing that elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels even within the normal range (>3.0mIU/L) are associated with higher mortality across multiple dialysis cohorts. Her seminal work showing a link between high-normal TSH levels and worse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) Short Form 36 (SF36) scores in dialysis patients also suggest that impaired HRQOL may be an under-recognized pathway to death. However, there remains considerable controversy as to 1) whether thyroid dysfunction is causally associated with adverse CV and patient-centered outcomes, 2) if elevated TSH levels represent hypothyroidism vs. non-thyroidal illness in CKD patients, and 3) the optimal TSH range associated with the greatest health benefit in dialysis patients. Furthermore, while United States Renal Data System data show that levothyroxine (L-T4) is one of the most commonly prescribed medications in pre-dialysis CKD and end-stage renal disease patients, little is known about its efficacy and safety in this population.  These discoveries have motivated the present R03 application in which Dr. Rhee aims to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of L-T4 administration over 12 weeks among 96 hemodialysis patients with high-normal or subclinical hypothyroid TSH levels who will be recruited from her parent NIH/NIDDK K23 study and the K24-sponsored “Malnutrition, Diet, and Racial Disparities in CKD” cohort. Aim 1 will determine L-T4’s efficacy in achieving a target TSH range of 0.5- 3.0mIU/L (primary objective). Aim 2 will examine whether L-T4 treatment results in improvement of 1) HRQOL SF36 scores and 2) novel CV biomarkers of heart failure, endothelial function, and platelet activation, 3) without leading to increased protein catabolism ascertained by indices of protein-energy wasting (secondary objective). Findings from this pilot feasibility study will provide the framework for a future, large-scale multi- center RCT that 1) may uncover thyroid dysfunction as a novel, modifiable risk factor for CV disease and impaired HRQOL, and 2) will inform the management of the vast number of CKD patients affected by this prevalent endocrine-renal disorder. Moreover, support of the R03 award will allow Dr. Rhee to accelerate her progress towards independence by providing her with 1) practical experience in the implementation of a pilot feasibility RCT, 2) hands-on exposure to translational medicine and laboratory platforms through CV biomarker testing, and 3) extension of the rich multi-disciplinary collaborations she has developed during the parent K23 award period. NARRATIVE Hypothyroidism, defined by elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels, is a common endocrine complication of chronic kidney disease that has been associated with impaired quality of life and cardiovascular complications. While levothyroxine is one of the most frequently prescribed medications in chronic kidney disease patients, little is known about its efficacy and safety in this population. This study will investigate 1) whether levothyroxine adequately lowers thyrotropin (TSH) levels to therapeutic target ranges, and 2) if thyroid hormone replacement improves quality of life and cardiovascular markers, without leading to wasting (i.e., loss of body mass, fat, and/or muscle mass) in dialysis patients.",A Pilot Feasibility Trial of Thyroid Hormone Replacement in Dialysis Patients,9517025,R03DK114642,"['Affect ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' Body Composition ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Complication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hypothyroidism ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity -

"Reducing disparities in living donor transplant among African Americans Abstract For most of the patients in the United States with end stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplantation represents the optimal treatment. Moreover, living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) offers numerous advantages over deceased donor kidney transplant such as better kidney quality, increased short- and long- term graft survival, lower rates of acute rejection, and reduced health care cost. Nevertheless, there are pervasive racial disparities in access to LDKT, with white ESRD patients four times more likely to receive a LDKT than African American ESRD patients. The long-term objective of this program of research is to understand the combined effect of a systems-level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians (Transplant Referral EXchange or T-REX) and a culturally-sensitive individual-level educational intervention (web-based Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing) on racial disparities in access to LDKT. The specific aims of the study are: (a) To develop and refine a web-based version of Living ACTS; (b) To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web-based Living ACTS intervention by comparing the percent of patients with at least one inquiry from a potential living donor among patients who receive Living ACTS compared to those who receive a control website with an embedded educational video; and (c) To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web-based Living ACTS intervention by adapting commonly used process evaluation constructs (context, reach, dose received, fidelity, and recruitment) for an online environment. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among a sample of 800 African American ESRD patients in the southeastern United States (ESRD Network 6 in Georgia and South Carolina), the region of the country with the largest proportion of African American ESRD patients on the waiting list. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions (intervention or control). Participants at all four collaborating transplant centers will be seen by providers who utilize T-REX, thus allowing us to test the independent effect of individual-level education on a systems-level intervention. The primary outcome is the percent of patients with at least one living donor inquiry. Secondary outcomes will test the effect of the intervention on key constructs of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to determine possible mediating pathways. Participants will undergo baseline assessment, access either the intervention or control educational materials, and complete an immediate follow-up assessment. Living donor inquiries will be examined over the subsequent 12 months. The process evaluation will utilize transplant center administrative records, immediate follow-up data from participants, website usage statistics, and study records. It is anticipated that achievement of these aims will yield outcomes with great clinical and public health impact. Narrative There are pervasive racial disparities in access to living donor kidney transplant, which for the majority of end stage renal disease patient represents the optimal treatment. The proposed study seeks to determine whether a systems-level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians coupled with culturally-sensitive individual level education is more effective at increasing access to living donor kidney transplant among African Americans than the systems-level intervention alone. In doing so, this study seeks to have a positive impact on public health and the vision of NIDDK, part of which is to seek insights and answers regarding health disparities in end stage renal disease.",Reducing disparities in living donor transplant among African Americans,9534084,R01DK114891,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Grant ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Motivation ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Friends ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' stem ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' follow up assessment ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' trial design ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' Wait Time ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' transplant centers ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,244299,0.10368551800856261
"Sex Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplant is regarded as the best treatment modality for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite the known benefits of kidney transplantation over dialysis, inequities in access to transplantation are present by sex. In both adults and children, female sex is associated with a lower likelihood of receiving a kidney transplant compared to male sex. The reasons for these disparities in access to transplant among women versus men are unclear. Because of the unique characteristics of populations with different underlying cause of ESRD, it is possible that sex-based disparities in access to transplant differ among the different underlying attributed causes of ESRD. Characteristics specific to different causes of ESRD (such as the propensity for a disease to progress more rapidly in one sex and therefore preclude completion of the transplant evaluation process prior to dialysis) may lead to differences in the magnitude of the inequities in access to transplant among men versus women. In addition, prior literature has also shown that women are less likely to receive a living donor transplant (especially from spouses), even though women are more likely to donate a kidney. The decision not to donate a kidney despite eligibility for donation may be associated with a potential donors' subjective perceptions regarding their own health and donor candidacy. We hypothesize that these health perceptions may differ among male versus female donors, contribute to lower donation rates by men, which in turn, lead to a smaller pool of potential donors that lowers access to kidney transplantation among women. The Kidney Failure Risk Projection (KFRP) equation has recently been established to provide objective estimates of the 15-year risk for the development of ESRD among potential donors. In this study, we will determine whether there are differences in male versus female donors' perception of self-health, and we will compare these self-perceptions with the objective measure of the risk of ESRD using the KFRP equation. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) determine whether differences in access to transplantation by sex are modified by underlying cause of ESRD and 2) understand perceived versus actual medical barriers to living kidney donation according to donor sex. The expected outcome of this proposal is that we will enhance our understanding of whether subpopulations of patients with various underlying causes of renal disease may benefit from specific interventions to equalize parity in transplant. We also seek to understand which factors may be modifiable in the living donor evaluation process to improve living donor transplantation rates and access of women to living donor transplants. UCSF is well-suited for the conduct of this proposal, given that UCSF is one of the largest transplant centers in the United States, performing 300-350 kidney transplants (including about 150 living donor transplants) annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women and girls with end-stage renal disease are significantly less likely than men and boys to undergo a kidney transplant. Reasons for this disparity have not yet been fully elucidated. Disparities in access to kidney transplant may be related to the underlying cause of end-stage renal disease and sex-based differences in access to living donors. The long-term goals of this proposal are to further our understanding of disparities in kidney transplant access and identify areas where improvements can be made to provide parity in access to kidney transplant for all patients.",Sex Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplant,9611135,F32DK118869,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Dropout ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Nephrology ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' parity ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urinary tract ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self Perception ', ' Funding ', ' Living Donors ', ' programs ', ' Equation ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' Outcome ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' Wait Time ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,83378,0.1542485265345923
"Wake Forest APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all US kidney transplants from African American kidney donors to determine their effect on transplant outcomes. In addition, the post- donation health and kidney function of African American living kidney donors will be assessed. We are applying to be the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC) for this NIH Funding Announcement. Shorter renal allograft survival is observed for transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors, relative to deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute to the disparity. These variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease, but rare in other racial/ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients in order to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. This information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation are made and regarding the safety of living kidney donation. Before this genotypic data can be used clinically, a prospective national study is required to evaluate all kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from retrospective studies needs to be collected, including recipient APOL1 genotypes, renal histologic data in failed allografts and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. We will perform the following activities for the APOLLO Network: overall study coordination, assist with preparation of the final protocol and Manual of Procedures, develop data tracking tools and the study website, collect and archive clinical and outcomes data, perform genotyping, statistical analyses, assessment of the primary outcome “time to allograft failure in transplanted kidneys from African American donors, based on donor APOL1 genotypes” and create a bio-repository. We will longitudinally assess vital status, kidney function and proteinuria in living African American kidney donors based on APOL1 genotypes. Prospective assessment of the effects of kidney donor APOL1 genotypes on serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria in transplant recipients with functioning allografts will also be performed. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Genetic information in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) from African American donors of kidneys and transplant recipients may provide more accurate assessments of the likelihood of long-term survival of transplanted kidneys and optimize matching of donors with recipients. This application is submitted in response to the National Institutes of Health request for applications for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Scientific and Data Research Center and proposes to prospectively evaluate effects of donor and recipient APOL1 genotypes in kidney transplants from African American donors performed at all US transplant programs.

"Genetics of kidney disease in diverse populations ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease affects one in 10 people worldwide, and it contributes to premature morbidity and death. The underlying mechanisms for its development and predisposition are unknown, limiting progress in the identification of prognostic biomarkers or the development of treatment interventions. There are known ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease risk, yet little research has been done in diverse (non-European) populations. Studies have identified several ancestral variants (e.g., APOL1, sickle cell) conferring risk of chronic kidney disease in persons of African ancestry including admixed Hispanics/Latinos. To better understand the genetic risk for chronic kidney disease across diverse populations, we recently established the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network Kidney (COGENT-Kidney) Consortium, which includes 71,638 participants from four major ancestral groups (African, Hispanic/Latino, European and East Asian). Using novel trans-ethnic meta-analysis approaches, we identified 20 loci for kidney function and showed important gains in uncovering functional variants within loci using diverse populations. The current proposal seeks to provide important needed information to address the contribution of ancestry-specific variants to the natural history of chronic kidney disease phenotypes in under-studied Hispanics/Latinos (Aim 1), by leveraging the comprehensive longitudinal data in over 12,000 participants of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latino. To identify novel genetic loci and underlying mechanisms that are relevant to all ancestries, we propose to recruit additional studies to the COGENT-Kidney Consortium for an unprecedented trans-ethnic meta-analysis of kidney traits, including a total of over 622,000 participants from diverse populations (East and South Asian, Hispanic/Latino, African and African American, American Indian, and white) (Aim 2). We will prioritize genes to test their functional role in in vitro experiments and mouse models of kidney injury (Aim 3). Our results can provide important insight into genetic contributions to ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease risk and to inform on molecular mechanisms related to chronic kidney disease development. Ultimately, this research could inform personalized medicine and improve the understanding and management of kidney health and disease.

"Reducing Disparities among Kidney Transplant Recipients Abstract: Disparities exist in access and outcomes of kidney transplantation. More than half of patients are hospitalized in the year after transplantation, and these patients are more likely AA and have lower socioeconomic status. Several studies have identified risk factors for hospital admission using traditional statistical methods, but models have been limited by moderate predictive accuracy, the use of static (rather than dynamic) models, and the use of administrative data that may not capture the changing risk factors pre- to post-transplant. The overall goal of this research is to develop and validate rigorous, dynamic risk prediction models, integrate these models within a clinician dashboard, and develop potential interventions to address surgical disparities in hospitalization following kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are 1) To develop and validate predictive models to identify transplant recipients at high risk of hospitalization following transplant; 2) To use a community-based participatory research approach to build an electronic hospitalization risk dashboard that will aid in clinical decision-making and guide the use of scarce resources for patients at high risk for hospitalization post-transplant. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant outcomes and reduce disparities among a primarily AA ESRD population in the Southeastern US. Project Narrative/Relevance: The proposed study seeks to utilize predictive analytics to develop and validate risk prediction models to identify patients at high risk for hospitalization following kidney transplantation, integrate the models into an existing clinical decision support platform for population health management, and use a community-based participatory research approach to inform development of a dashboard to deploy resources that will help improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities in kidney transplantation.",Reducing Disparities among Kidney Transplant Recipients,9544306,R01MD011682,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' time use ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Patient risk ', ' data visualization ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' dashboard ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' transplant centers ', ' clinical decision support ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,479310,0.10316886172741535
"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort(CRIC) Study Project Summary/Abstract Despite the dramatic growth of the Hispanic population with end stage renal disease in the U.S., relatively little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is based at the University of Illinois at Chicago and is an ancillary study to the NIDDK-sponsored multi-center CRIC Study. During the first two funding periods, the study assembled a sizable cohort of Hispanics with moderate to severe CKD and addressed critical questions. One key finding was that compared to non-Hispanics whites, Hispanics with CKD are burdened by lower socioeconomic status, poorer blood pressure control, higher depressive symptoms, and lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Furthermore, we found that Hispanics with CKD experienced a twofold higher rate of CKD progression but this disparity was explained by potentially modifiable sociodemographic and clinical factors. This finding has important implications for practice and underscores the need to better understand factors influencing risk factor control and health outcomes in Hispanics. As a result of our findings, the scientific scope of this competitive renewal has been broadened to address knowledge gaps in the following areas: 1) epidemiology of mild CKD, 2) impact of sociocultural/ psychosocial factors on CKD progression and cardiovascular events among Hispanics, and 3) influence of CKD progression on patient-centered outcomes. First, because individuals with mild CKD comprise a much larger proportion of the CKD population, improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors in early disease may have substantial public health implications. Recognizing the need to understand the epidemiology of mild CKD, the parent CRIC Study recently recruited 1500 additional adults with eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2. However, only 4% of these participants are Hispanic. Second, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that sociocultural and psychosocial factors influence health outcomes in Hispanics but these factors have not been studied in the context of CKD. Third, in addition to studying traditional clinical outcomes, there is growing recognition of the need to study outcomes defined by patients as being important. This application seeks to continue follow-up of the existing Hispanic CRIC cohort and enrich it with recruitment of 125 Hispanics with mild CKD (eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2) to accomplish the following Aims: 1) Evaluate the association of Hispanic ethnicity with risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in adults with mild CKD; 2) Investigate the association of sociocultural and psychosocial factors with CKD progression and cardiovascular events among Hispanics across the spectrum of CKD severity; and 3) Examine the relationship of CKD progression with patient-centered outcomes (e.g., HRQOL, physical function, pain) across the spectrum of CKD severity, among Hispanics and across racial/ethnic groups. The renewal of Hispanic CRIC and its continued close link to the parent CRIC Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to efficiently address a broad range of critical questions regarding the epidemiology of CKD in Hispanics. Project Narrative During the first two funding periods, the Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study has provided important insights about the burden of moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics and its impact on various outcomes. The proposed renewal expands the scientific scope of the study by focusing on mild CKD and conducting a rigorous evaluation of sociocultural/psychosocial factors and patient- centered outcomes which are relevant to the Hispanic CKD population. Knowledge gained from this study has the potential of contributing to the development of more effective ways to treat Hispanics with CKD.",Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort(CRIC) Study,9547692,R01DK072231,"['Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chicago ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Illinois ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Lipids ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Chronic Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Chronic Renal Insufficiency ', ' frailty ', ' Event ', ' Physical Function ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health related quality of life ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,660204,0.12406853018927087
"Patient Oriented Research in Kidney Disease and Transplant Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 600,000 adults in the US suffer from ESRD. For the appropriate patients, kidney transplantation (KT) reduces mortality, improves quality of life, and saves substantial Medicare dollars. However, selecting patients for KT can be challenging, particularly among certain subgroups such as older adults, and current metrics are of limited utility in informing clinical decision-making. Furthermore, once selected for KT, patients face similar challenges when considering deceased donor offers or deciding if to allow friends or family to put themselves at risk as living donors. Predicting which patients would benefit from KT, and optimally matching them to the right donor, is one of the most critical concerns for patients, transplant physicians, and referring nephrologists. This is a proposal for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award for Dorry Segev, MD, PhD, an Associate Professor of Surgery and Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Segev leads three major R01-funded patient- oriented research efforts to address the challenges of ESRD and KT clinical decision-making: (1) A prospective study of frailty and risk prediction among older dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients; (2) A retrospective study of long-term outcomes and survival benefit from incompatible live donor kidney transplantation; and (3) A multi-center longitudinal study of long-term sequelae of kidney donation. In addition to addressing the aims of the individual grants, these studies provide rich substrate for ancillary studies by mentees, including thousands of patients engaged in several cohorts, as well as many opportunities for advanced methodologic training. Dr. Segev is actively mentoring students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty in an exciting, productive multidisciplinary environment. This K24 will afford future mentees the opportunity to leverage Dr. Segev's rich ongoing research portfolio with the following new aims: (1) To better understand dialysis and KT outcomes important to older adults; (2) To quantify secondary risks of incompatible KT protocols; (3) To elucidate familial, genetic, and non-renal risks after kidney donation; (4) To design models to assist KT candidates with organ offer decisions; and (5) To expand Dr. Segev's capacity to mentor the next generation of clinician-scientists in ESRD and KT by pursuing formal training in mentoring, learning leadership skills from experts at JHU, continuing to foster multidisciplinary collaborations across the institution, connecting with mentors and mentees from across the country, and refining a curriculum for teaching patient-oriented research to surgeons and other clinicians PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predicting which patients would benefit from kidney transplantation, and best matching them to the right kidney donor, is one of the most critical concerns for patients, transplant physicians, and referring nephrologists. This award will allow Dorry Segev, MD, PhD and his team of mentees to better understand risk prediction by examining outcomes important to older adults, risks of immunosuppression associated with transplantation, and risks of donating a kidney.

"Living Donor Wage Reimbursement Trial PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The waiting list for kidney transplantation (KT) now exceeds 100,000 and waiting times exceed 7 yrs in some U.S. regions. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) accelerates the path to transplantation and yields superior outcomes compared to dialysis and deceased donor KT. However, the annual number of LDKTs has declined over the last decade, particularly among minority and low-income patients. We hypothesize, and have preliminary data to support, that the financial impact on living donors (LDs) is a major contributor to the LDKT decline and for persistent racial disparities in LDKT rates. Many LDs have substantial non-reimbursed direct and indirect costs, most notably the loss of income or wages following surgery. In this study, we will: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of offering reimbursement for LD lost wages on the LDKT rate; (2) examine whether offering reimbursement for LD lost wages reduces known racial disparities in LDKT; and (3) determine whether study outcomes differ significantly by maximum reimbursement amount for LD lost wages. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a blended randomized trial and matched historical control study with a planned enrollment of 350 KT candidates who will be randomized to one of two parallel arms: (1) possible reimbursement of LD lost wages up to $1,500 (LW-1.5), or (2) possible reimbursement of LD lost wages up to $3,000 (LW-3.0). Our central hypotheses are that offering reimbursement for LD lost wages will (a) yield higher LDKT rates overall relative to matched historical controls, and (b) reduce the disparity between LDKT rates in white and minority patients relative to historical patterns. Also, we hypothesize that KT candidates who are offered up to $3,000 reimbursement for LD lost wages will have a higher likelihood of LDKT compared to those offered up to $1,500 of reimbursement for LD lost wages. Finally, we will assess the impact of offering reimbursement for LD lost wages on the decision-making of both KT candidates and potential LDs as well as perceptions of pressure/coercion and decision stability. Overall, the proposed study will be the first to empirically examine the impact of offering LD lost wages reimbursement on the willingness of KT candidates to pursue LDKT, racial disparity in LDKT, rates of LD evaluations, and actual LDKT rates. Moreover, this study will be the first to examine the differential impact on these outcomes of offering to reimburse LD lost wages for different amounts ($1,500 vs. $3,000) after donation. As such, findings from this study have very high potential to impact policy, clinical practice, LDKT access, and known income and racial disparities in KT. The assembled interdisciplinary research team has a long track record of collaboration and is internationally recognized for developing innovative strategies to increase LDKT access in disadvantaged patient populations, extramural funding to conduct large RCTs and multi-center studies, and dissemination of research findings with broad policy and clinical practice implications. PROJECT NARRATIVE This application is responsive to numerous calls within the transplant field to empirically evaluate the benefits and costs associated with removing financial disincentives for living kidney donors. If successful, findings from this study will directly address several HealthyPeople2020 objectives (Objectives: CKD HP2020-2, CKD HP2020-5, CKD HP2020-6, CKD HP2020-13), recommendations made in the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) report on organ donation, and recommendations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation.

"Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those on dialysis, have a substantially higher prevalence of hypothyroidism (HT) compared to their non-CKD counterparts. In the general population, HT is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, presumably due to atherosclerosis, platelet activation and thrombosis, and coronary heart disease (CHD) events. CKD patients have an exceedingly high CV mortality, with many of these fatalities related to CHD. However, little is known about the prognostic implications of HT on the CV health and survival of CKD patients.  Dr. Connie Rhee is a nephrologist at the University of California Irvine (UCI) with a strong commitment to the fields of endo-nephrology and drug comparative effectiveness in CKD. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator with a specific focus on thyroid functional disorders in kidney disease. The support of the K23 award will allow Dr. Rhee to achieve the following objectives: 1) investigate the impact of HT and its treatment on CHD risk and survival in CKD patients; 2) gain practical experience in the execution of patient-oriented research; 3) develop proficiency in navigating innovative multidisciplinary collaborations in nephrology, endocrinology, cardiovascular disease, and human subjects research; 4) and acquire expertise in advanced epidemiologic and biostatistical methods.  In order to accomplish these objectives, Dr. Rhee will first examine the longitudinal impact of HT on mortality in a well-characterized prospective hemodialysis (HD) cohort in whom thyroid function will be rigorously defined using a combination of novel and traditional assays (Aim 1). She will then examine the association between HT and 3 specific CV surrogate endpoints (endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification, and platelet activation) that represent major pathogenic mechanisms contributing to CHD risk in CKD (Aim 2). Lastly, she will examine the degree to which the association of HT with mortality is modified by underlying renal function in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients, and if these associations are ameliorated by thyroid hormone treatment using advanced analytic techniques (marginal structural modeling) that improve causal inference (Aim 3). Dr. Rhee will efficiently leverage resources from the NIDDK-sponsored ""Malnutrition, Diet, and Racial Disparities in CKD"" multicenter study and the unique strengths of the NIDDK-sponsored national Veterans Affairs (VA) database as she implements these Specific Aims. Findings from this proposed research will have the potential to uncover HT as a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse CV outcomes in CKD; improve the diagnostic approach and management of this highly prevalent endocrine-renal disorder; and reduce the excess burden of CV death in this vulnerable population. Dr. Rhee will be closely guided by her primary mentor, Dr. Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at UCI whose vast experience in patient-oriented research will be complemented by Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary co-mentor and collaborator team: 1) Dr. Gregory Brent, Professor, Chair of Medicine at the Greater Los Angeles VA, and renowned leader in thyroid hormone research; 2) Dr. Danh Nguyen, Professor and Director of the UCI Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit with expertise in the longitudinal evaluation of CV risk factors in dialysis patients; 3) Dr. Steven Brunelli, Associate Epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Senior Director of DaVita Clinical Research with extensive experience in causal inference methods; 4) Dr. Csaba Kovesdy, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at the Memphis VA widely known for his research in the national veteran population; and 5) Dr. Matthew Budoff, Professor and Director of Cardiac Computed Tomography at Harbor UCLA with expertise in cardiovascular diagnostic imaging methods. Dr. Rhee will also draw upon the wealth of UCI's research environment, which includes the Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology and the Division of Nephrology; the Institute of Clinical and Translational Science that is home to the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit; UCI's Departments of Epidemiology and Statistics; as well as the broader research enterprise of neighboring University of California campuses. Dr. Rhee's proposed K23 study, mentorship team, career development plan, and collaborative research environment will catalyze her scientific productivity and provide her with a strong foundation as a future independent investigator and leader in endo-nephrology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hypothyroidism is a common complication in chronic kidney disease patients, who represent a sizeable portion of the US population. While hypothyroidism has been associated with an accelerated risk of coronary heart disease and death in the general population, little is known about the impact of hypothyroidism on the exceedingly high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease patients. This study will investigate 1) whether hypothyroidism magnifies the risk of coronary heart disease and mortality in patients with varying degrees of impaired kidney function, and 2) the role of thyroid hormone treatment in reducing hypothyroid-related death risk in chronic kidney disease, which will advance our understanding of whether hypothyroidism is a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in this vulnerable population.","Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease",9482706,K23DK102903,"['Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' coronary calcification ', ' coronary artery calcification ', ' digital ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' structural heart defect ', ' structural heart condition ', ' structural cardiac defect ', ' structural cardiac anomaly ', ' structural cardiac abnormality ', ' structural heart disease ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complication ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypothyroidism ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Morbidity -

"A novel clinical assay for detection of APOL1 renal risk alleles SUMMARY/ABSTRACT African Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic and end stage kidney disease; while 35% of patients on dialysis are African American, only 13.2% of the U.S. population is African American. One factor contributing to this disparity are genetic variations in apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). APOL1 is a plasma protein protective against human sleeping sickness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. In humans, there are three allelic variants of APOL1: G0 (wildtype), G1, and G2. The G1 and G2 APOL1 alleles (i.e. renal risk alleles) impart resistance to sleeping sickness, while the G0 allele promotes parasite survival and infection. For this reason, the G1 and G2 alleles are found almost exclusively in African and African American populations. While beneficial for resisting sleeping sickness, the G1 and G2 variants are also associated with a greatly increased risk for end stage renal disease. Moreover, in the renal transplantation setting, the presence of any two risk alleles (G1/G1, G2/G2 or G1/G2) in the donor kidney is strongly associated with poor graft survival, whereas the presence of just one copy of the G0 allele completely eliminates this increased risk (G0/G0, G1/G0, G2/G0). As a result, African Americans are at a higher risk for end stage renal disease and donor kidneys containing two APOL1 renal risk alleles may not be suitable for transplantation. It is therefore essential that donors are screened for APOL1 renal risk alleles prior to kidney donation. Unfortunately, the current gold standard for genotyping APOL1 requires gene sequencing and is technically infeasible during the limited time frame for triaging deceased donor organs. Structural differences in the APOL1 variants, in combination with differential binding to a parasite protein, make this system a suitable target for assay development. Affinergy plans to develop a simple, rapid, and affordable peptide-based detection system for the qualitative assessment of APOL1 G0 status to improve risk stratification during renal transplantation. At the conclusion of Phase 1, we expect to have a technology that can be developed into a diagnostic assay in Phase 2 for use by clinicians and researchers to quickly assess for kidney disease risk through the rapid detection of APOL1 G0 in plasma. PROJECT NARRATIVE APOL1, a protein protective against African sleeping sickness, has three variants (G0, G1 and G2); the G1 and G2 variants, found predominantly in African and African American populations, convey disease resistance but also greatly increase the risk for kidney disease while just one copy of the wildtype APOL1 G0 variant eliminates this risk. In kidney transplantation, donor kidneys containing two APOL1 renal risk alleles fare poorly following transplant but the only way to determine APOL1 status is through gene sequencing, which is expensive and has a slow turnaround time incompatible with pre-transplant assessment. In this Phase I application, we propose to develop a novel diagnostic assay that can rapidly demonstrate the presence or absence of the wild- type APOL1 G0 protein for use in kidney transplant risk stratification.",A novel clinical assay for detection of APOL1 renal risk alleles,9620170,R43MD013402,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' mAbs ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Phages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Clinical Chemistry ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Laboratories ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Parasites ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' pressure ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Serum Proteins ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Triage ', ' Trypanosoma ', ' Trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma brucei brucei ', ' Trypanosoma brucei ', ' T. brucei ', ' T brucei ', ' Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense ', ' Trypanosoma rhodesiense ', ' T.rhodesiense ', ' T. rhodesiense ', ' T rhodesiense ', ' Rhodesian trypanosome ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' African ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Notification ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Sampling ', ' assay development ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' resistant to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistance to disease ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Affinity ', ' Detection ', ' Phage Display ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' rapid detection ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' high risk ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' Risk stratification ', ' ']",NIMHD,"AFFINERGY, LLC",R43,2018,300428,0.03778341691723954
"2/2 APOL1 Long-Term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network- Clinical Center Project Summary (Abstract) The Columbia-Penn Clinical Consortium (CPCC) brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team of clinical and basic scientist investigators at Columbia University Medical Center and University of Pennsylvania Transplant Programs. The CPCC investigators have expertise in the fields of transplant epidemiology, immunology, genetics and ethics, as well as an extensive history of collaboration with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and other CPCC member transplant programs. As a result, the CPCC is well suited to recruit and retain patients for longitudinal follow up for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Research Network (APOLLO). This proposed Clinical Center will comprise of 26 pediatric and adult large, medium and small size transplant centers and 9 organ procurement organizations predominantly in four contiguous states (NY, NJ, CT and PA) in the northeast US. Our primary objective is to enroll all donors of African ancestry (e.g. African-Americans and Black Hispanic) and their recipients within the consortium for genetic and genomic studies by the APOLLO Network (Aim 1). We will follow all recruited donor-recipient pairs with longitudinal collection of biospecimens and clinical outcomes along with pragmatic integration with Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), UNOS and the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data (Aim 2). Our experience in the recruitment and retention of minority patients in multicenter studies, as well as the use of innovative analytics with linkage to UNOS, USRDS and other geospatial data, will be of benefit to the APOLLO Network. We expect that our unique design and implementation expertise to the APOLLO study will address the hypothesis that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants is associated with inferior allograft outcomes following kidney transplant and increases the risk of adverse renal outcomes for affected living donors.

"APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center Shorter allograft survival is observed for kidneys transplanted from deceased African American donors relative to those from deceased European American donors. Recent retrospective reports have indicated that the presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in the kidney donors significantly contributes to this disparity. APOL1 renal-risk variants are common in U.S. populations with African ancestry (primarily African Americans) and are strongly associated with end-stage renal disease for patients with non- diabetic kidney disease, yet these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. Before APOL1 genotypic data can be widely applied in the transplant community, however, a prospective multi-center study must be performed to evaluate outcomes of kidneys from donors with African ancestry. Critical clinical post-transplant information that was lacking in the prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, particularly kidney-biopsy data and key potential modifiers such as development of viral infections, donor-specific antibodies, and episodes of acute rejection. The NIH will fund a nationwide prospective study to assess the impact of APOL1 renal-risk variants on the outcomes of recipients of a kidney from a deceased or living donor with African ancestry and on the kidney health of living donors with African ancestry after nephrectomy. The study will consist of as many as 15 Clinical Centers and a central Scientific Data Research Center (SDRC). The Clinical Centers will collect one-time blood samples from each participant for APOL1 genotyping at the SDRC and will submit longitudinal clinical data for the recipients and living donors to the SDRC to assess the impact of APOL1 genotype on development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The results from this national study have the potential to transform organ allocation and informed consent processes in the transplantation of kidneys from donors with African ancestry, improve renal allograft survival, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby APOL1 renal-risk variants produce kidney disease. Specific variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1, which are generally restricted to persons with recent African ancestry, have been associated in retrospective analyses with increased risk of end-stage native- kidney disease and shorter survival of kidney transplants. The proposed prospective study will examine the impact of these variants on kidney-transplant recipients and donors, while taking into account various environmental or comorbid conditions that can cause kidney damage. The findings from this study have the potential to transform allocation of kidneys for transplantation, improve survival of transplanted kidneys, better inform potential kidney donors with recent African ancestry of the risks of donation, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby these genetic variants produce kidney disease.",APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center,9567470,U01DK115997,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Creatinine ', ' Cytomegalovirus Infections ', ' Salivary Gland Virus Disease ', ' Inclusion Disease ', ' Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease ', ' CMV infection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' indexing ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Ischemia ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Lupus Nephritis ', ' Lupus Glomerulonephritis ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Lesion ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Failure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' renal clearance ', ' Renal clearance function ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Allografting ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' American ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' organ allocation ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' preservation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2018,269850,0.1687060681782469
"Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium Summary/Abstract Data demonstrate that transplanted kidneys from African American (AA) deceased donors are associated with reduced survival relative to kidneys from non-AA donors. Additional data demonstrate that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants, that are found exclusively in AA individuals, have been associated with an increased risk of CKD/ESRD in the general AA population. Two risk variants of this gene have a prevalence of 13% in AAs, and may account for some or all of the increased risk of transplant loss. There are also anecdotal reports of AA living kidney donors with two APOL1 risk variants developing ESRD raising further concerns. The APOLLO study proposes to enroll all deceased and living AA kidney donors in order to definitively address the impact of APOL1 variants on kidney transplant outcomes. The Emory APOLLO Clinical Centers consortium is comprised of 12 centers distributed across the US but focused in the Southeast. In 2015 these 12 programs transplanted 219 kidneys from deceased and living AA donors accounting for about 9% of all recipients of AA kidneys, the eligible study cohort in the US. The specific aims of our consortium are: (1) to perform APOL1 genotyping on all AA deceased and living kidney donors and create a sample repository for future studies to determine whether additional genetic factors contribute to the second hit postulated to be required for risk manifestation, (2) to compare the survival and function of all transplanted kidneys from AA donors to determine the impact of two APOL1 risk variants on transplant outcomes as well as exploring the potential of environmental factors (rejection, infections, comorbid conditions such as hypertension) to provide the second hit, and 3) to study whether African American living donors who carry two copies of the variant APOL1 genes are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease. Blood samples for APOL1 genotyping of deceased donors will be provided by the organ procurement organization, while the transplant centers will provide blood for genotyping recipients and living donors (as well as deceased donors when necessary). Demographic and clinical donor and recipient data will be provided by UNOS for all subjects. More granular clinical data will be provided for patients receiving their long-term follow up from one the 12 participating transplant centers. We propose enrolling subjects for 1 year and following them for 3 years thereby maximizing the likelihood of observing clinical events. The primary outcome measure for recipients of deceased donor kidneys is graft survival with secondary outcome measures assessing a variety of indicators of renal function and injury. As advance CKD or ESRD following living kidney donation are highly unlikely events, given the relatively short study duration the primary outcome for living kidney donors will be the change in renal function from the post-transplant baseline to the end of follow up at 3 years post-donation. When combined with the data from the other 14 APOLLO Clinical Center Consortia, we believe our data will contribute to a much more complete understanding of the impact of APOL1 gene variants on the outcomes of kidney transplantation and donation. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE STATEMENT: This study will improve the public health by determining if transplanted kidneys from African American donors who have two specific copies of variants of the apolipoprotein L1 gene (called APOL1) fail more rapidly than kidneys donated by African Americans without two variant copies of these genes. Should this study confirm the negative impact of the variant APOL1 genes this information would be very helpful for transplant professionals counseling patients in need of kidney transplantation about the benefits and risks of accepting a kidney transplant from a donor with two variant copies of APOL1 versus waiting for a transplant from a different donor at a later time. This study will also determine whether otherwise healthy African American patients who have these genes can safely be living kidney donors, or whether the presence of the two APOL gene variants increases their risk of kidney disease so much that they cannot safely donate.",Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium,9566871,U01DK116099,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood donor ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Injury ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' uroplakin III ', ' Uroplakin 3A ', ' Uroplakin 3 ', ' UPK3A ', ' UPK3 ', ' UPIIIA ', ' UP3 ', ' UPK3 gene ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Allografting ', ' Inferior ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' hazard ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' graft failure ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' sharing data ', ' Regimen ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' imaging study ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,269852,0.1788708586833125
"Metabolomics and Genomics in African Americans with CKD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Two recent discoveries suggest that common, African-specific genetic risk factors are particularly relevant in CKD susceptibility. Variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) and the presence of a single copy of the sickle cell mutation (sickle cell trait, or SCT) both increase the risk of CKD progression. How these variants confer kidney risk, whether there is gene-gene interplay, and the identity of any causal intermediates is unknown. The proposed studies will use two complementary cohorts of African Americans with CKD, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) and a subset of BioMe, to investigate these questions. The AASK study is arguably the most comprehensively phenotyped of African Americans with CKD in the world, assessing participants' kidney function every 6 months for up to 12 years (and up to 17 years for end-stage renal disease and death). BioMe is an ongoing, contemporary cohort of patients receiving medical care in New York City, with substantial resources devoted to biospecimen collection and genotyping. The analysis will build upon our prior work in genetic risk factors for CKD by investigating novel variants and their relationship to kidney function decline as well as gene-gene interplay in risk for adverse CKD outcomes. In addition, we will study the relationship of metabolomic patterns - a snapshot of the end-product of cellular processes - with CKD outcomes. This analysis can lead to identification of novel and potentially modifiable risk factors for CKD outcomes. When combined with genomic data, the metabolomic consequences of genetic risk variants such as the APOL1 high-risk genotype or SCT can be studied. In addition, analytic techniques can help distinguish whether metabolomic risk factors cause adverse CKD outcomes or are simply a byproduct of an associated process. Understanding the relationship between genomics, metabolomics, and outcomes will advance knowledge regarding pathogenic pathways and potentially modifiable targets in CKD progression, particularly in African Americans, an ethnic group disproportionately affected with advanced CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Recent studies have identified two African-specific genetic variants which may explain much of the ethnic differences in CKD risk. Understanding gene function, and in particular the metabolomic intermediates which may be targeted by interventions, can provide critical information that will lead to reductions in CKD incidence and progression among African Americans.",Metabolomics and Genomics in African Americans with CKD,9462097,R01DK108803,"['Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Bile Acids ', ' Bilirubin ', ' Bilirubin IX alpha ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Indican ', ' Indoxyl Sulfate ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' New York City ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sickle Cell Trait ', ' Toxin ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' tricresol ', ' Cresol ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' African ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Visit ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,602942,0.15574747467922387
"Social Network Analysis and Renal Education to Promote Transplantation (SNARE Transplant) Project Summary Candidate: Although the majority of my training has been clinical, I have developed a unique area of research applying social network theory to examine kidney transplant disparities in hemodialysis patients. My short‐term goals are to obtain the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully complete the proposed research and to conduct theoretically‐grounded, translational research in kidney transplantation. My long‐term career goals are to become an experienced, independent researcher applying social network theory and analytic techniques to improve outcomes for disadvantaged patients with kidney disease. Career Development Plan: My career development plan combines didactic coursework, professional training, and mentored instruction. Specifically, I propose to earn through the College of Public Health and Center for Biomedical Informatics a Master's in Epidemiology and participate in training activities to increase my knowledge of and proficiency in public health, epidemiology, health behavior theory, health communication, social network theory, transplant epidemiology, biomedical ethics, social network analysis, and computing. Research Plan: Women and ethnic minorities are less likely to be informed of the option of transplantation, referred to a transplant center, and complete the medical evaluation needed to be placed on the kidney transplant waiting list. The goal of this research study is to identify and characterize the complete social networks of hemodialysis (HD) patients. We will measure the relative influence of HD social networks on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards transplantation. We will use repeated survey measures as well clinical observations to construct models of these social networks. Finally, we will conduct a transplant education intervention pilot study that tests the diffusion of knowledge and behaviors through the hemodialysis clinic social network. Project Narrative There are significant and persistent disparities in access to kidney transplantation and as a result most patients with end stage renal disease receive hemodialysis (HD). HD is unique as it is a treatment performed in a group setting which lends itself to forming social networks. The goal of this research study is to identify and characterize the social networks of HD patients and measure the influence of HD social networks on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards transplantation using repeated surveys and a network targeted educational intervention.",Social Network Analysis and Renal Education to Promote Transplantation (SNARE Transplant),9518890,K23DK111943,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Information Networks ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Address ', ' Health Communication ', ' Improve Access ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' Instruction ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Minority ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' network models ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' improved outcome ', ' treatment choice ', ' gender disparity ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,K23,2018,189431,0.07472058232766406
"Leveraging ancestry to map kidney loci ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease is a progressive and heterogeneous condition that affects 10% of individuals worldwide, and a cause of premature cardiovascular disease and death. Little is known about the mechanisms leading to its development and predisposition. Despite the strong evidence for a role of ancestry in chronic kidney disease susceptibility, few studies have leveraged ancestry for gene discovery. Hispanics are an understudied minority group that is comprised of many overlapping ancestral groups (Amerindian, West African, European). Hispanics have a high prevalence of increased albuminuria and end-stage renal disease, which has been associated with their Amerindian ancestry. We propose to identify ancestry-specific loci, and their corresponding rare and common genetic variants, that explain the higher susceptibility for chronic kidney disease in Hispanics. We will use novel admixture mapping approaches to map genomic segments and variants inherited from the ancestral population with the higher disease variant frequency (Aim 1), followed by fine-mapping and validation of associations in ancestry-specific cohorts (Hispanics, American Indians, European and West Africa ancestries) (Aim 2). We will leverage data from the large population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos for gene discovery, and propose to fine-map Amerindian loci using a combination of genotyping and targeted sequencing. To gain insights into the functional roles of identified genes, we will prioritize variants for experiments using in vitro and mouse model systems for transgenic and gene targeting studies (Aim 3). This proposal leverages ancestry to identify loci for kidney traits in Hispanics, and uniquely complement large ongoing genome wide association approaches. Our results will provide clues to racial/ethnic disparities in disease risk, and improve understanding of the biological pathways leading to chronic kidney disease. Ultimately this research could inform personalized medicine and improve public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study proposes to identify genetic variants that explain ethnic variation in chronic kidney disease susceptibility in Hispanic/Latinos and American Indians, two understudied populations for genetic risk of chronic kidney disease. Findings from this study may have a broad impact on informing ethnic disparities in disease risk, could inform personalized medicine and improve public health of U.S. minority population.

"MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CKD Project Summary  The purpose of the renewal of this mid-career investigator award titled, “Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD (MADRAD)” by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics and Public Health at the University California Irvine School of Medicine and UCLA School of Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research endeavors with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several University of California and Veterans Affairs-affiliated campuses in Southern California. These centers provide care to underserved, indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis for survival. In the US, African Americans and Hispanics have a substantially higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (3.5 and 1.5 times higher, respectively) than non-Hispanic Whites. While the overall 5-year survival of ESRD patients is less than 40%, with the highest mortality risk observed among malnourished patients, minority dialysis patients exhibit lower mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival differences and the contribution of nutritional status and dietary factors to these disparities may have major clinical and public health implications.  The PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race/ethnicity. Several alternative hypotheses related to racial/ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms, bone and mineral disorders, mental health and psychosocial factors, and dialysis treatment characteristics will also be examined. The PI proposes a 5-year prospective patient-oriented research study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,500 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African American and 1/3 Hispanic), in collaboration with Southern California dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status, quality of life, clinical events, and survival will be longitudinally assessed. Genetic factors such as APOL1 risk alleles will also be examined, and biospecimens for future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects, additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be developed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 150,000 HD patients.  The support of the K24 award for this prospective study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue to expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator for early-career investigators in renal nutrition and CKD disparities by leveraging his networking relationships across several campuses and centers including the University of California system and its Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Kaiser Permanente of Southern Calif., UCLA Public Health, and LA and Orange County Health Departments; (2) continue to expand his persistent efforts in increasing the participation of minority populations in CKD research studies across Southern California; and (3) continue his cultivation of an innovative area of CKD disparities and nutrition research through promising early career investigators and the ongoing support of collaborators in Southern California. The data and hypotheses generated during this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to promote additional patient-oriented studies by mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Relevance of Research to Public Health  Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and their relationship with nutritional status, diet, genetic factors, and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to the development of more effective strategies to improve the survival and quality of life of dialysis patients, an additional 20 million CKD patients, and an additional 30 to 40 million Americans who suffer from chronic disease states associated with wasting disorders such as chronic heart failure. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important objectives.","MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and serious chronic disease that often leads to end-stage renal disease and major cardiovascular events. Although evidence-based CKD care can slow disease progression and avert complications, less than 10% of CKD patients currently receive major elements of CKD care in a timely fashion. The objective of this project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a technology-driven and team-based intervention to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes for patients with stage 3-4 CKD. The proposed intervention uses a sophisticated Web-based clinical decision support (CDS) system that is seamlessly integrated within the electronic health record (EHR) to: (a) identify adults with CKD at primary care encounters; (b) suggest personalized evidence-based treatment options to increase the appropriate use of renoprotective antihypertensive medications, improve blood pressure control, and improve glycemic management in patients with diabetes; and (c) suggest to patients and providers when collaboration and consultation with nephrologists may be advisable. We rigorously test the impact of the intervention by randomly assigning 30 primary care clinics with approximately 120 primary care physicians and 6100 adults with evidence of stage 3-4 CKD to the CDS intervention versus usual care and assess intervention impact on 5 key evidence-based elements of care for patients with CKD: (i.) recognition and diagnosis of CKD in patients who meet diagnostic criteria; (ii.) adequate blood pressure control; (iii.) optimal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use; (iv.) adequate glucose control; and (v.) nephrology consultation when appropriate. The intervention, referred to as CKD-CDS, provides patient-specific and stage-specific CKD treatment options in high- and low-literacy formats to the primary care provider (PCP) and patients at each primary care encounter to facilitate shared decision making. This CKD-CDS will be implemented using previously successful methods that in previous CDS studies have achieved very high use rates with patients (>75% of targeted patient encounters) for diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Scalability of this NIH- developed, non-commercialized intervention strategy is supported by its current use (without the CKD identification or specific recommendations) in 4 large medical groups that provide care to 2,000,000 patients in rural and urban areas in 4 Midwestern states, with research contracts to extend use to more than 60 safety net clinics in an additional 14 states in 2018. If the addition of CKD-CDS to this tool is effective, the intervention is immediately scalable and could (a) improve quality of care for large numbers of CKD patients, thereby slowing progression of CKD and improving quality of life, (b) maximize the clinical return on massive public and private investments now being made in sophisticated outpatient EHR systems, and (c) provide a health informatics prototype that rapidly and consistently translates evolving evidence-based CKD clinical guidelines into delivery of personalized and coordinated CKD care within primary care settings. Project Narrative To prevent serious chronic kidney disease (CKD) complications such as end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events, better strategies are needed to identify, treat, and refer CKD patients seen in primary care clinics. This project expands an existing and successful non-proprietary Web-based clinical decision support system to include key elements of CKD care and rigorously assesses the impact of this intervention on quality of CKD care for patients seen in primary care settings, including better recognition of CKD, better management of blood pressure and glucose, and more timely referral to nephrologists when appropriate. This low-cost and highly scalable intervention has high potential to improve CKD care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of patients with CKD.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care,9590264,R18DK118463,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Albumins ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Consultations ', ' Creatinine ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electrolytes ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypotension ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nephrology ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Private Sector ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Sector ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Recommendation ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Contracts ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose regulation ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose control ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' safety net ', ' prototype ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' hypertension management ', ' hypertension control ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' clinical decision support ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIDDK,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R18,2018,499984,0.12854727821437756

In addition, during the funding period his research portfolio has further expanded with him becoming PI for the Fogarty International Center-sponsored Mexico CRIC Study based in Mexico City, Co-PI for the NHLBI-funded Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Chicago Field Center, and Associate Director for a T32 program focused on health disparities in minority populations. This comprehensive research program provides a wealth of opportunities for his trainees. The overarching objective of the proposed new research program for this K24 renewal is to evaluate the impact of two potentially modifiable health behaviors (sedentary behavior and sleep) on health outcomes in patients with CKD. This research will leverage Dr. Lash's leadership role in large ongoing observational studies with substantial representation of racial/ethnic minorities. In addition, the research program will also include a pilot intervention focused on reducing sedentary behavior and improving sleep quality in adults with CKD. In addition to its focus on areas of significance, the proposed research will provide trainees with a rich range of opportunities in patient-oriented research in CKD. Trainees will also participate in didactic training through the School of Public Health and have access to the extensive resources and infrastructure provided by the Center for Clinical Translational Science. The renewal of this K24 award will provide Dr. Lash with the protected time and resources to continue to expand his successful research program and continue to provide productive mentorship of new physician scientists to develop the skills needed to become independent investigators in kidney disease research. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing numbers of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The strengths of this K24 renewal application are as follows: the applicant's robust research program focusing on chronic kidney disease in minorities, his successful track record in mentoring new clinician investigators during the first period of funding, the comprehensive plan for mentoring and developing the careers of new physician scientists, the strong institutional support and resources at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and an innovative research proposal investigating the impact of two potentially modifiable health behaviors (sedentary behavior and sleep) on health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease.",Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program,9443372,K24DK092290,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Award ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Illinois ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mexico ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Training ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Chronic Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Chronic Renal Insufficiency ', ' experience ', ' international center ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24) ', ' K24 Award ', ' Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research ', ' Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24) ', ' K24 Program ', ' K24 Mechanism ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' sleep quality ', ' blood pressure intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,K24,2018,193508,0.11660752483429337
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,9500664,R01HL141892,"['Affect ', ' Albumins ', ' Restrictive Cardiomyopathy ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' cardiac graft ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Insurance ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Laboratories ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' lung transplant ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Patient Rights ', ' Perfusion ', ' Prostitution ', ' survival sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' commercial sex ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Liver Failure ', ' Hepatic Failure ', ' forest ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Hypoalbuminemia ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Knowledge ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' EFRAC ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' time use ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transplant registry ', ' transplant data base ', ' transplant database ', ' clinical practice ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' mathematical methods ', ' cardiac cachexia ', ' improved outcome ', ' transplant centers ', ' cardiodevice ', ' cardiac device ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2018,708656,0.06913361874510784
"Wake Forest Collaborative Application for an APOLLO Clinical Center We are applying to participate as an APOLLO Clinical Center in this national prospective study. The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all U.S. kidney transplantations from African American donors to determine their effects on transplant outcomes. In addition, the health of living African American kidney donors will be assessed. Information that was lacking from prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. Our investigative team, led by two PIs with complementary expertise, has led the way in clinical trials to address the marked disparities in African Americans with end-stage kidney disease. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute. These renal-risk variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease. In contrast, these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may prove to be clinically useful in those with recent African ancestry in the setting of allocation of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and assessment of prospective living kidney donors. Genotypic information (precision medicine) may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. Information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation. However, before these genotypic data can be used in the clinical setting, a prospective national study is required to evaluate kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from prior retrospective studies will be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. This is the rationale and setting for the current APOLLO trial. In this important multi-site study, our site will work closely with the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center and the other participating sites to recruit and prospectively follow eligible kidney donors and transplant recipients based on the APOLLO protocol. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors; reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that donors having kidney disease risk variants in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene may contribute. This APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center application is designed to prospectively evaluate effects of donor and recipient APOL1 genotypes in kidney transplantations performed at 20 affiliated transplant programs.

"Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation Project Summary  End stage renal disease (ESRD) is among the ten leading causes of death for Americans, and its incidence and prevalence are rising, especially among non-White groups. Kidney transplantation is the most effective treatment option for many Americans, but the number of Americans needing kidneys is currently much larger and rising much faster than current transplant levels. Patients who seek transplants have one of two options: wait for a kidney from a deceased donor to become available, or obtain a transplant from a living kidney donor. Deceased donor kidney transplant levels are projected to grow little over time, constrained by population aging and mortality patterns, but living donation donor kidney transplantation (LDD KT) holds the prospect of substantial growth if healthy population members are willing and able to donate. Unfortunately, there are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in LDD KT rates that compound disparities in rates of ESRD. Prior research hypothesizes that differential access to healthy, compatible donors in candidates' social networks may explain racial disparities in usage of LDD KT. However, a limitation of this work is that it focuses on those who are evaluated for donation, not the many members of transplant candidates' social networks who could be evaluated for donation, but are not. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT. Based on qualitative interviews and a pilot survey of 72 transplant candidates we previously collected in a large transplant center, we suspect that the differential access hypothesis does not hold, and that there are promising points of social intervention for researchers to reduce racial disparities in LDD KT. These pilot data show large LDD KT underutilization for all candidates, and that Black candidates have access to promising living donors at higher rates than White candidates. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the primary barrier to eliminating disparities in LDD KT and promoting greater utilization of LDD KT for all groups is social, not biomedical, in origin. In this proposal, we will extend our prior work to develop and test evidence based, randomized social network interventions that will target social barriers to LDD KT and follow up with candidate medical records to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. Specifically, we will compare a control group of candidates to those assigned to two treatments that we will pilot and test: a) a search intervention where a subset of candidates is coached to approach promising family members that seem to be underutilized based on our pilot data, and b) a rhetorical intervention where we encourage a subset of candidates to use scripts for discussing transplantation with family members that we find to be effective in survey vignette experiments and focus groups. With eighteen month medical records follow up of all candidates and the large amount of data we will obtain on their social networks, we will assess the social barriers that lead to underutilization of LDD KT, how those factors vary by race, and how they can be reduced through promising social network interventions. LDD KT has substantial potential to solve public health challenges around the growing prevalence of ESRD, and the basic and applied knowledge that we will develop as part of this proposal will help to unlock this potential.   Project Narrative  This project will evaluate underutilization of living donor donation kidney transplantation (LDD KT) at two large kidney transplant centers and develop and test evidence based, randomized interventions to increase LDD KT and reduce racial disparities in its use. LDD KT is the most promising treatment option to meet the challenges of a rising population of Americans with end stage renal disease (ESRD), but LDD KT rates are not increasing and racial disparities in the use of LDD KT are widening. Prior research has documented that non-white transplant candidates are less likely than white candidates to have family or friends evaluated for LDD KT, and that those evaluated for donation to non-white candidates are less likely to be deemed healthy and compatible enough to donate than those evaluated for white candidates, but it has not examined the full family and social networks in which candidates are embedded in order to determine whether limited access to healthy, compatible donors drives underutilization and racial disparities or whether other social barriers are in operation. This neglect is unfortunate because there are many non-medical interventions that could be tested to increase rates of LDD KT by giving candidates more information about what types of family members to approach and how to approach them. Prior qualitative and quantitative pilot work we have conducted suggests that some of the largest barriers arise from decisions candidates make about which family members to ask for kidney transplants, and whether family members volunteer to be evaluated upon hearing of a candidate's diagnosis. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social network interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT, which we will evaluate with longitudinal medical records follow up. In the first year and a half of the project, we will build on prior qualitative, quantitative, and experimental pilot data we have collected to develop and refine two separate interventions in focus groups and survey vignette experiments. In years two through four, we will survey transplant candidates at two large transplant centers about their family and social networks, with special attention to candidate perceptions of their network members' health and willingness and ability to donate. During this time, we will also survey candidate network members using effective referral based survey strategies in order to obtain additional information on the barriers to donation among family and close social network members of kidney transplant candidates. We will assign each surveyed candidate to one of three experimental arms that encompass the interventions developed during the first year and a half of the project: a control group, a group that we coach on which of their network members to approach, and a group that we coach on how to approach their network members. In years four and five of the project, we will follow up on the candidates, examining whether they had a potential donor evaluated, who that donor was, and whether they were able to obtain a living donor transplant. The results of this project will contribute to basic and applied knowledge about social barriers to access in LDD KT, and quantify the efficacy of promising social network approaches for promoting greater utilization of LDD KT and reducing racial disparities therein.  ",Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation,9540002,R01DK114888,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Kinship Networks ', ' Respondent ', ' Organ Donations ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' tool ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' volunteer ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' transplant centers ', ' experimental arm ', ' ']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2018,253075,0.11358149906998188
"APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center Shorter allograft survival is observed for kidneys transplanted from deceased African American donors relative to those from deceased European American donors. Recent retrospective reports have indicated that the presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in the kidney donors significantly contributes to this disparity. APOL1 renal-risk variants are common in U.S. populations with African ancestry (primarily African Americans) and are strongly associated with end-stage renal disease for patients with non- diabetic kidney disease, yet these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. Before APOL1 genotypic data can be widely applied in the transplant community, however, a prospective multi-center study must be performed to evaluate outcomes of kidneys from donors with African ancestry. Critical clinical post-transplant information that was lacking in the prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, particularly kidney-biopsy data and key potential modifiers such as development of viral infections, donor-specific antibodies, and episodes of acute rejection. The NIH will fund a nationwide prospective study to assess the impact of APOL1 renal-risk variants on the outcomes of recipients of a kidney from a deceased or living donor with African ancestry and on the kidney health of living donors with African ancestry after nephrectomy. The study will consist of as many as 15 Clinical Centers and a central Scientific Data Research Center (SDRC). The Clinical Centers will collect one-time blood samples from each participant for APOL1 genotyping at the SDRC and will submit longitudinal clinical data for the recipients and living donors to the SDRC to assess the impact of APOL1 genotype on development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The results from this national study have the potential to transform organ allocation and informed consent processes in the transplantation of kidneys from donors with African ancestry, improve renal allograft survival, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby APOL1 renal-risk variants produce kidney disease. Specific variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1, which are generally restricted to persons with recent African ancestry, have been associated in retrospective analyses with increased risk of end-stage native- kidney disease and shorter survival of kidney transplants. The proposed prospective study will examine the impact of these variants on kidney-transplant recipients and donors, while taking into account various environmental or comorbid conditions that can cause kidney damage. The findings from this study have the potential to transform allocation of kidneys for transplantation, improve survival of transplanted kidneys, better inform potential kidney donors with recent African ancestry of the risks of donation, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby these genetic variants produce kidney disease.",APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center,9768568,U01DK115997,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Creatinine ', ' Salivary Gland Virus Disease ', ' Inclusion Disease ', ' Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease ', ' CMV infection ', ' Cytomegalovirus Infections ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' indexing ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Ischemia ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Lupus Glomerulonephritis ', ' Lupus Nephritis ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' urinary infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Lesion ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Failure ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal clearance function ', ' renal clearance ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Allografting ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' American ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' organ allocation ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' preservation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' renal damage ', ' kidney damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' post-transplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2019,346141,0.1687060681782469
"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort(CRIC) Study Project Summary/Abstract Despite the dramatic growth of the Hispanic population with end stage renal disease in the U.S., relatively little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is based at the University of Illinois at Chicago and is an ancillary study to the NIDDK-sponsored multi-center CRIC Study. During the first two funding periods, the study assembled a sizable cohort of Hispanics with moderate to severe CKD and addressed critical questions. One key finding was that compared to non-Hispanics whites, Hispanics with CKD are burdened by lower socioeconomic status, poorer blood pressure control, higher depressive symptoms, and lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Furthermore, we found that Hispanics with CKD experienced a twofold higher rate of CKD progression but this disparity was explained by potentially modifiable sociodemographic and clinical factors. This finding has important implications for practice and underscores the need to better understand factors influencing risk factor control and health outcomes in Hispanics. As a result of our findings, the scientific scope of this competitive renewal has been broadened to address knowledge gaps in the following areas: 1) epidemiology of mild CKD, 2) impact of sociocultural/ psychosocial factors on CKD progression and cardiovascular events among Hispanics, and 3) influence of CKD progression on patient-centered outcomes. First, because individuals with mild CKD comprise a much larger proportion of the CKD population, improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors in early disease may have substantial public health implications. Recognizing the need to understand the epidemiology of mild CKD, the parent CRIC Study recently recruited 1500 additional adults with eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2. However, only 4% of these participants are Hispanic. Second, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that sociocultural and psychosocial factors influence health outcomes in Hispanics but these factors have not been studied in the context of CKD. Third, in addition to studying traditional clinical outcomes, there is growing recognition of the need to study outcomes defined by patients as being important. This application seeks to continue follow-up of the existing Hispanic CRIC cohort and enrich it with recruitment of 125 Hispanics with mild CKD (eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2) to accomplish the following Aims: 1) Evaluate the association of Hispanic ethnicity with risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in adults with mild CKD; 2) Investigate the association of sociocultural and psychosocial factors with CKD progression and cardiovascular events among Hispanics across the spectrum of CKD severity; and 3) Examine the relationship of CKD progression with patient-centered outcomes (e.g., HRQOL, physical function, pain) across the spectrum of CKD severity, among Hispanics and across racial/ethnic groups. The renewal of Hispanic CRIC and its continued close link to the parent CRIC Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to efficiently address a broad range of critical questions regarding the epidemiology of CKD in Hispanics. Project Narrative During the first two funding periods, the Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study has provided important insights about the burden of moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics and its impact on various outcomes. The proposed renewal expands the scientific scope of the study by focusing on mild CKD and conducting a rigorous evaluation of sociocultural/psychosocial factors and patient- centered outcomes which are relevant to the Hispanic CKD population.

"Metabolomics and Genomics in African Americans with CKD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Two recent discoveries suggest that common, African-specific genetic risk factors are particularly relevant in CKD susceptibility. Variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) and the presence of a single copy of the sickle cell mutation (sickle cell trait, or SCT) both increase the risk of CKD progression. How these variants confer kidney risk, whether there is gene-gene interplay, and the identity of any causal intermediates is unknown. The proposed studies will use two complementary cohorts of African Americans with CKD, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) and a subset of BioMe, to investigate these questions. The AASK study is arguably the most comprehensively phenotyped of African Americans with CKD in the world, assessing participants' kidney function every 6 months for up to 12 years (and up to 17 years for end-stage renal disease and death). BioMe is an ongoing, contemporary cohort of patients receiving medical care in New York City, with substantial resources devoted to biospecimen collection and genotyping. The analysis will build upon our prior work in genetic risk factors for CKD by investigating novel variants and their relationship to kidney function decline as well as gene-gene interplay in risk for adverse CKD outcomes. In addition, we will study the relationship of metabolomic patterns - a snapshot of the end-product of cellular processes - with CKD outcomes. This analysis can lead to identification of novel and potentially modifiable risk factors for CKD outcomes. When combined with genomic data, the metabolomic consequences of genetic risk variants such as the APOL1 high-risk genotype or SCT can be studied. In addition, analytic techniques can help distinguish whether metabolomic risk factors cause adverse CKD outcomes or are simply a byproduct of an associated process. Understanding the relationship between genomics, metabolomics, and outcomes will advance knowledge regarding pathogenic pathways and potentially modifiable targets in CKD progression, particularly in African Americans, an ethnic group disproportionately affected with advanced CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Recent studies have identified two African-specific genetic variants which may explain much of the ethnic differences in CKD risk. Understanding gene function, and in particular the metabolomic intermediates which may be targeted by interventions, can provide critical information that will lead to reductions in CKD incidence and progression among African Americans.",Metabolomics and Genomics in African Americans with CKD,9695974,R01DK108803,"['Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Bile Acids ', ' Bilirubin ', '

"Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for kidney transplantation continues to exceed the supply. Increasing the number of living kidney donors is a major priority. Historically, living donors were healthy and free of isolated medical abnormalities (IMA) at the time of donation. Recently, general US population demographics have changed, and in response, transplant centers now include donors with IMAs such as pre-hypertension (pre-HTN), obesity, and metabolic syndrome. At a general population level, individuals with IMAs, particularly African Americans (AA), are more likely to develop comorbidities, such as diabetes, HTN, and chronic kidney disease. Recent data suggest that AA living kidney donors are more likely to have a pre-donation IMA. It remains unclear what impact, if any, living donation will have on development of these comorbidities, and whether racial disparities in risk attributable to donation exist. Current methods for assessing living donor long-term health risks are imprecise, relying heavily on traditional factors such as family and social histories. Morphometric measures (e.g. vascular calcifications; fat distribution), using radiologic imaging, have emerged as strong predictors of cardiovascular risk. Pre-donation imaging, routinely acquired during donor evaluations to assess renal anatomy, can be leveraged to identify novel morphometric risk predictors for post-donation comorbidities. I hypothesize that morphometric measures will greatly improve prediction of post-donation comorbidities, including risk directly attributable to donation. Given significant knowledge gaps in risk prediction and stratification of donors with IMAs, I propose an ancillary study that will leverage data from an ongoing R01-funded cohort study of live donors to create the largest cohort of IMA donors studied and will address unique aims: (1) explore the association of novel morphometric measures and traditional risk factors with post-donation comorbidity stratified by race; (2) develop a risk tool for predicting post-donation comorbidities; and (3) estimate risk attributable to living kidney donation. Utilization o novel morphometric measures obtained from routine pre- donation imaging is innovative, highly practical, and will create a level of risk prediction of living donor outcomes that currently does not exist. Precise risk prediction will improve informed consent, donor autonomy in medical decision making, and will change the practice of live kidney donor selection in the US. Resources and infrastructure at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, including the most AA living kidney donors in the US, are keenly in-line with the proposed aims, and will provide the necessary foundation to see the proposed project to its successful completion. The mentored award will foster my growth as an independent investigator by affording me opportunities to focus on building an expertise in novel risk prediction research and enhancing my exposure to health disparities and chronic disease epidemiology in minority populations. This additional training will inform my path toward long-term career goals of research independence as a surgeon-scientist and R01 funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the demand for kidneys continues to exceed the supply, transplant centers have begun to relax selection criteria to include living donors with obesity and/or high blood pressure. Expansion of selection criteria has occurred despite a paucity of supporting safety data. It is critical to balance increasing live donation for transplant candidate against the responsibility of understanding long-term risks specific to donors at the extremes of current selection criteria for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care.",Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities,9689439,K23DK103918,"['Alabama ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Award ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Informed Consent ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Time ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Disease-Free Survival ', ' Event-Free Survival ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Vascular calcification ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Categories ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' prehypertension ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictive tools ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' transplant centers ', ' Infrastructure ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2019,179553,0.1640769313831251
"Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation Project Summary  End stage renal disease (ESRD) is among the ten leading causes of death for Americans, and its incidence and prevalence are rising, especially among non-White groups. Kidney transplantation is the most effective treatment option for many Americans, but the number of Americans needing kidneys is currently much larger and rising much faster than current transplant levels. Patients who seek transplants have one of two options: wait for a kidney from a deceased donor to become available, or obtain a transplant from a living kidney donor. Deceased donor kidney transplant levels are projected to grow little over time, constrained by population aging and mortality patterns, but living donation donor kidney transplantation (LDD KT) holds the prospect of substantial growth if healthy population members are willing and able to donate. Unfortunately, there are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in LDD KT rates that compound disparities in rates of ESRD. Prior research hypothesizes that differential access to healthy, compatible donors in candidates' social networks may explain racial disparities in usage of LDD KT. However, a limitation of this work is that it focuses on those who are evaluated for donation, not the many members of transplant candidates' social networks who could be evaluated for donation, but are not. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT. Based on qualitative interviews and a pilot survey of 72 transplant candidates we previously collected in a large transplant center, we suspect that the differential access hypothesis does not hold, and that there are promising points of social intervention for researchers to reduce racial disparities in LDD KT. These pilot data show large LDD KT underutilization for all candidates, and that Black candidates have access to promising living donors at higher rates than White candidates. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the primary barrier to eliminating disparities in LDD KT and promoting greater utilization of LDD KT for all groups is social, not biomedical, in origin. In this proposal, we will extend our prior work to develop and test evidence based, randomized social network interventions that will target social barriers to LDD KT and follow up with candidate medical records to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. Specifically, we will compare a control group of candidates to those assigned to two treatments that we will pilot and test: a) a search intervention where a subset of candidates is coached to approach promising family members that seem to be underutilized based on our pilot data, and b) a rhetorical intervention where we encourage a subset of candidates to use scripts for discussing transplantation with family members that we find to be effective in survey vignette experiments and focus groups. With eighteen month medical records follow up of all candidates and the large amount of data we will obtain on their social networks, we will assess the social barriers that lead to underutilization of LDD KT, how those factors vary by race, and how they can be reduced through promising social network interventions. LDD KT has substantial potential to solve public health challenges around the growing prevalence of ESRD, and the basic and applied knowledge that we will develop as part of this proposal will help to unlock this potential.   Project Narrative  This project will evaluate underutilization of living donor donation kidney transplantation (LDD KT) at two large kidney transplant centers and develop and test evidence based, randomized interventions to increase LDD KT and reduce racial disparities in its use. LDD KT is the most promising treatment option to meet the challenges of a rising population of Americans with end stage renal disease (ESRD), but LDD KT rates are not increasing and racial disparities in the use of LDD KT are widening. Prior research has documented that non-white transplant candidates are less likely than white candidates to have family or friends evaluated for LDD KT, and that those evaluated for donation to non-white candidates are less likely to be deemed healthy and compatible enough to donate than those evaluated for white candidates, but it has not examined the full family and social networks in which candidates are embedded in order to determine whether limited access to healthy, compatible donors drives underutilization and racial disparities or whether other social barriers are in operation. This neglect is unfortunate because there are many non-medical interventions that could be tested to increase rates of LDD KT by giving candidates more information about what types of family members to approach and how to approach them. Prior qualitative and quantitative pilot work we have conducted suggests that some of the largest barriers arise from decisions candidates make about which family members to ask for kidney transplants, and whether family members volunteer to be evaluated upon hearing of a candidate's diagnosis. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social network interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT, which we will evaluate with longitudinal medical records follow up. In the first year and a half of the project, we will build on prior qualitative, quantitative, and experimental pilot data we have collected to develop and refine two separate interventions in focus groups and survey vignette experiments. In years two through four, we will survey transplant candidates at two large transplant centers about their family and social networks, with special attention to candidate perceptions of their network members' health and willingness and ability to donate. During this time, we will also survey candidate network members using effective referral based survey strategies in order to obtain additional information on the barriers to donation among family and close social network members of kidney transplant candidates. We will assign each surveyed candidate to one of three experimental arms that encompass the interventions developed during the first year and a half of the project: a control group, a group that we coach on which of their network members to approach, and a group that we coach on how to approach their network members. In years four and five of the project, we will follow up on the candidates, examining whether they had a potential donor evaluated, who that donor was, and whether they were able to obtain a living donor transplant. The results of this project will contribute to basic and applied knowledge about social barriers to access in LDD KT, and quantify the efficacy of promising social network approaches for promoting greater utilization of LDD KT and reducing racial disparities therein.  ",Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation,9694659,R01DK114888,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hearing ', ' Incidence ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Kinship Networks ', ' Respondent ', ' Organ Donations ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' volunteer ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' transplant centers ', ' experimental arm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' ']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,235208,0.11358149906998188
"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and serious chronic disease that often leads to end-stage renal disease and major cardiovascular events. Although evidence-based CKD care can slow disease progression and avert complications, less than 10% of CKD patients currently receive major elements of CKD care in a timely fashion. The objective of this project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a technology-driven and team-based intervention to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes for patients with stage 3-4 CKD. The proposed intervention uses a sophisticated Web-based clinical decision support (CDS) system that is seamlessly integrated within the electronic health record (EHR) to: (a) identify adults with CKD at primary care encounters; (b) suggest personalized evidence-based treatment options to increase the appropriate use of renoprotective antihypertensive medications, improve blood pressure control, and improve glycemic management in patients with diabetes; and (c) suggest to patients and providers when collaboration and consultation with nephrologists may be advisable. We rigorously test the impact of the intervention by randomly assigning 30 primary care clinics with approximately 120 primary care physicians and 6100 adults with evidence of stage 3-4 CKD to the CDS intervention versus usual care and assess intervention impact on 5 key evidence-based elements of care for patients with CKD: (i.) recognition and diagnosis of CKD in patients who meet diagnostic criteria; (ii.) adequate blood pressure control; (iii.) optimal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use; (iv.) adequate glucose control; and (v.) nephrology consultation when appropriate. The intervention, referred to as CKD-CDS, provides patient-specific and stage-specific CKD treatment options in high- and low-literacy formats to the primary care provider (PCP) and patients at each primary care encounter to facilitate shared decision making. This CKD-CDS will be implemented using previously successful methods that in previous CDS studies have achieved very high use rates with patients (>75% of targeted patient encounters) for diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Scalability of this NIH- developed, non-commercialized intervention strategy is supported by its current use (without the CKD identification or specific recommendations) in 4 large medical groups that provide care to 2,000,000 patients in rural and urban areas in 4 Midwestern states, with research contracts to extend use to more than 60 safety net clinics in an additional 14 states in 2018. If the addition of CKD-CDS to this tool is effective, the intervention is immediately scalable and could (a) improve quality of care for large numbers of CKD patients, thereby slowing progression of CKD and improving quality of life, (b) maximize the clinical return on massive public and private investments now being made in sophisticated outpatient EHR systems, and (c) provide a health informatics prototype that rapidly and consistently translates evolving evidence-based CKD clinical guidelines into delivery of personalized and coordinated CKD care within primary care settings. Project Narrative To prevent serious chronic kidney disease (CKD) complications such as end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events, better strategies are needed to identify, treat, and refer CKD patients seen in primary care clinics. This project expands an existing and successful non-proprietary Web-based clinical decision support system to include key elements of CKD care and rigorously assesses the impact of this intervention on quality of CKD care for patients seen in primary care settings, including better recognition of CKD, better management of blood pressure and glucose, and more timely referral to nephrologists when appropriate. This low-cost and highly scalable intervention has high potential to improve CKD care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of patients with CKD.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care,9776511,R18DK118463,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Albumins ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Consultations ', ' Creatinine ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Electrolytes ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Hypotension ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrology ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Private Sector ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Sector ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Recommendation ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Contracts ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' glycemic control ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose regulation ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose control ', ' safety net ', ' prototype ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' hypertension control ', ' hypertension management ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' secondary analysis ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' clinical decision support ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIDDK,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R18,2019,492223,0.12854727821437756
"OPTIMIZing  carE in Chronic Kidney Disease (OPTIMIZE CKD) Revised Abstract R18 DK118460-01: OPTIMIZing carE in Chronic Kidney Disease (OPTIMIZE CKD) Millions of adults have chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to substantial morbidity, mortality and health care costs. These effects are concentrated in patients with high-risk disease. Several provider- and system-level barriers lead to well-described gaps in care for these patients, contributing to poor outcomes. Population health management (PHM) improves health by aggregating and analyzing data across a population to drive consistent, evidence-based care. CKD PHM using electronic health records (EHRs) can be a sustainable strategy to overcome physician- and system-level barriers. EHR-based PHM could improve the identification of patients with high-risk CKD; increase the use of evidence-based, widely available, and cost-effective interventions; and enhance medication safety. The Kidney- Coordinated HeAlth Management Partnership (Kidney-CHAMP) study (R01DK116957-01A1) is testing the effectiveness of a multi-faceted EHR-based PHM intervention to improve the delivery of evidence-based CKD care in high-risk patients. Specifically, it targets: 1) timely communication of high-risk CKD, 2) implementation of remote nephrology guidance (E-consult) to improve evidence-based CKD care, 3) provision of pharmacist-led medication safety reviews, and 4) standardized CKD patient education. This 42-month pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial in ~1,700 high risk CKD patients from 330 Primary care physicians (PCPs) will evaluate the intervention’s effects on key processes of care and kidney disease progression.   The proposed ancillary study to Kidney-CHAMP will qualitatively identify barriers/facilitators of the intervention’s effectiveness and response heterogeneity in diverse settings and with diverse patient and provider groups.  Participants will be selected using purposive sampling from the PCPs and patients who are randomized to the intervention arm in Kidney-CHAMP study. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to elicit key physician and patient level predictors that underlie effectiveness of the intervention in diverse settings, which will allow refinements of CKD phenotypes and transportability of the intervention in heterogeneous populations. These deliverables would strengthen future trials and specifically address disparity in CKD care by interviewing patients from vulnerable groups including minorities, low socioeconomic status, and those with multi-morbidity. This ancillary study is highly complementary and valuable to the evaluation of the Kidney-CHAMP intervention. The proposed qualitative work will further refine future efforts to improve the intervention’s implementation, dissemination and use in real practice and diverse healthcare settings. CKD is associated with an unacceptably high human and financial cost. Gaps in CKD care contribute to catastrophic outcomes such as dialysis dependence. Novel system-based interventions are needed to improve CKD care. Real time risk stratification and population health management using electronic health records can improve CKD care and outcomes in the patients who need it most.",OPTIMIZing  carE in Chronic Kidney Disease (OPTIMIZE CKD),9774045,R18DK118460,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Communication ', ' Financial cost ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' intervention effect ', ' population health ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Risk stratification ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' service engagement ', ' provider-level barriers ', ' provider barriers ', ' system-level barriers ', ' health management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health care management ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' practice setting ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' medication safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' drug safety ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R18,2019,99141,0.16385474688637156
"Wake Forest Collaborative Application for an APOLLO Clinical Center We are applying to participate as an APOLLO Clinical Center in this national prospective study. The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all U.S. kidney transplantations from African American donors to determine their effects on transplant outcomes. In addition, the health of living African American kidney donors will be assessed. Information that was lacking from prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. Our investigative team, led by two PIs with complementary expertise, has led the way in clinical trials to address the marked disparities in African Americans with end-stage kidney disease. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute. These renal-risk variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease. In contrast, these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may prove to be clinically useful in those with recent African ancestry in the setting of allocation of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and assessment of prospective living kidney donors. Genotypic information (precision medicine) may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. Information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation. However, before these genotypic data can be used in the clinical setting, a prospective national study is required to evaluate kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from prior retrospective studies will be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. This is the rationale and setting for the current APOLLO trial. In this important multi-site study, our site will work closely with the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center and the other participating sites to recruit and prospectively follow eligible kidney donors and transplant recipients based on the APOLLO protocol. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors; reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that donors having kidney disease risk variants in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene may contribute. This APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center application is designed to prospectively evaluate effects of donor and recipient APOL1 genotypes in kidney transplantations performed at 20 affiliated transplant programs. Results from our Center, as part of the national APOLLO study, could help transform organ allocation and informed consent in kidney transplantation, optimize survival of patients after kidney transplantation, and determine the safety of living kidney donation.",Wake Forest Collaborative Application for an APOLLO Clinical Center,9781378,U01DK116040,"['Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Creatinine ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Illinois ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Informed Consent ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrology ', ' North Carolina ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Work ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Failure ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Antibody titer measurement ', ' antibody titering ', ' Allografting ', ' Outcome Study ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Vital Status ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Aliquot ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' delayed graft function ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' implantation ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' high risk ', ' organ allocation ', ' preimplantation ', ' pre-implantation ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' academic program ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' recruit ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' ']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2019,346142,0.17609933971647945
"Social Network Analysis and Renal Education to Promote Transplantation (SNARE Transplant) Project Summary Candidate: Although the majority of my training has been clinical, I have developed a unique area of research applying social network theory to examine kidney transplant disparities in hemodialysis patients. My short‐term goals are to obtain the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully complete the proposed research and to conduct theoretically‐grounded, translational research in kidney transplantation. My long‐term career goals are to become an experienced, independent researcher applying social network theory and analytic techniques to improve outcomes for disadvantaged patients with kidney disease. Career Development Plan: My career development plan combines didactic coursework, professional training, and mentored instruction. Specifically, I propose to earn through the College of Public Health and Center for Biomedical Informatics a Master's in Epidemiology and participate in training activities to increase my knowledge of and proficiency in public health, epidemiology, health behavior theory, health communication, social network theory, transplant epidemiology, biomedical ethics, social network analysis, and computing. Research Plan: Women and ethnic minorities are less likely to be informed of the option of transplantation, referred to a transplant center, and complete the medical evaluation needed to be placed on the kidney transplant waiting list. The goal of this research study is to identify and characterize the complete social networks of hemodialysis (HD) patients. We will measure the relative influence of HD social networks on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards transplantation. We will use repeated survey measures as well clinical observations to construct models of these social networks. Finally, we will conduct a transplant education intervention pilot study that tests the diffusion of knowledge and behaviors through the hemodialysis clinic social network. Project Narrative There are significant and persistent disparities in access to kidney transplantation and as a result most patients with end stage renal disease receive hemodialysis (HD). HD is unique as it is a treatment performed in a group setting which lends itself to forming social networks.

"Leveraging ancestry to map kidney loci ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease is a progressive and heterogeneous condition that affects 10% of individuals worldwide, and a cause of premature cardiovascular disease and death. Little is known about the mechanisms leading to its development and predisposition. Despite the strong evidence for a role of ancestry in chronic kidney disease susceptibility, few studies have leveraged ancestry for gene discovery. Hispanics are an understudied minority group that is comprised of many overlapping ancestral groups (Amerindian, West African, European). Hispanics have a high prevalence of increased albuminuria and end-stage renal disease, which has been associated with their Amerindian ancestry. We propose to identify ancestry-specific loci, and their corresponding rare and common genetic variants, that explain the higher susceptibility for chronic kidney disease in Hispanics. We will use novel admixture mapping approaches to map genomic segments and variants inherited from the ancestral population with the higher disease variant frequency (Aim 1), followed by fine-mapping and validation of associations in ancestry-specific cohorts (Hispanics, American Indians, European and West Africa ancestries) (Aim 2). We will leverage data from the large population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos for gene discovery, and propose to fine-map Amerindian loci using a combination of genotyping and targeted sequencing. To gain insights into the functional roles of identified genes, we will prioritize variants for experiments using in vitro and mouse model systems for transgenic and gene targeting studies (Aim 3). This proposal leverages ancestry to identify loci for kidney traits in Hispanics, and uniquely complement large ongoing genome wide association approaches. Our results will provide clues to racial/ethnic disparities in disease risk, and improve understanding of the biological pathways leading to chronic kidney disease. Ultimately this research could inform personalized medicine and improve public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study proposes to identify genetic variants that explain ethnic variation in chronic kidney disease susceptibility in Hispanic/Latinos and American Indians, two understudied populations for genetic risk of chronic kidney disease. Findings from this study may have a broad impact on informing ethnic disparities in disease risk, could inform personalized medicine and improve public health of U.S. minority population.

"MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CKD Project Summary  The purpose of the renewal of this mid-career investigator award titled, “Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD (MADRAD)” by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics and Public Health at the University California Irvine School of Medicine and UCLA School of Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research endeavors with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several University of California and Veterans Affairs-affiliated campuses in Southern California. These centers provide care to underserved, indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis for survival. In the US, African Americans and Hispanics have a substantially higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (3.5 and 1.5 times higher, respectively) than non-Hispanic Whites. While the overall 5-year survival of ESRD patients is less than 40%, with the highest mortality risk observed among malnourished patients, minority dialysis patients exhibit lower mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival differences and the contribution of nutritional status and dietary factors to these disparities may have major clinical and public health implications.  The PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race/ethnicity. Several alternative hypotheses related to racial/ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms, bone and mineral disorders, mental health and psychosocial factors, and dialysis treatment characteristics will also be examined. The PI proposes a 5-year prospective patient-oriented research study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,500 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African American and 1/3 Hispanic), in collaboration with Southern California dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status, quality of life, clinical events, and survival will be longitudinally assessed. Genetic factors such as APOL1 risk alleles will also be examined, and biospecimens for future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects, additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be developed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 150,000 HD patients.  The support of the K24 award for this prospective study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue to expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator for early-career investigators in renal nutrition and CKD disparities by leveraging his networking relationships across several campuses and centers including the University of California system and its Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Kaiser Permanente of Southern Calif., UCLA Public Health, and LA and Orange County Health Departments; (2) continue to expand his persistent efforts in increasing the participation of minority populations in CKD research studies across Southern California; and (3) continue his cultivation of an innovative area of CKD disparities and nutrition research through promising early career investigators and the ongoing support of collaborators in Southern California. The data and hypotheses generated during this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to promote additional patient-oriented studies by mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Relevance of Research to Public Health  Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and their relationship with nutritional status, diet, genetic factors, and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to the development of more effective strategies to improve the survival and quality of life of dialysis patients, an additional 20 million CKD patients, and an additional 30 to 40 million Americans who suffer from chronic disease states associated with wasting disorders such as chronic heart failure. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important objectives.","MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

"Reducing Disparities among Kidney Transplant Recipients Abstract: Disparities exist in access and outcomes of kidney transplantation. More than half of patients are hospitalized in the year after transplantation, and these patients are more likely AA and have lower socioeconomic status. Several studies have identified risk factors for hospital admission using traditional statistical methods, but models have been limited by moderate predictive accuracy, the use of static (rather than dynamic) models, and the use of administrative data that may not capture the changing risk factors pre- to post-transplant. The overall goal of this research is to develop and validate rigorous, dynamic risk prediction models, integrate these models within a clinician dashboard, and develop potential interventions to address surgical disparities in hospitalization following kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are 1) To develop and validate predictive models to identify transplant recipients at high risk of hospitalization following transplant; 2) To use a community-based participatory research approach to build an electronic hospitalization risk dashboard that will aid in clinical decision-making and guide the use of scarce resources for patients at high risk for hospitalization post-transplant. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant outcomes and reduce disparities among a primarily AA ESRD population in the Southeastern US. Project Narrative/Relevance: The proposed study seeks to utilize predictive analytics to develop and validate risk prediction models to identify patients at high risk for hospitalization following kidney transplantation, integrate the models into an existing clinical decision support platform for population health management, and use a community-based participatory research approach to inform development of a dashboard to deploy resources that will help improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities in kidney transplantation.",Reducing Disparities among Kidney Transplant Recipients,9688119,R01MD011682,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Perioperative ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' time use ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' national surveillance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' data visualization ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' dashboard ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health care management ', ' transplant centers ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' post-transplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,499888,0.10316886172741535
"A Culturally Targeted Transplant Program to Increase Live Donation in Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The shortage of organs for kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is magnified in Hispanics/Latin Americans. Hispanics have a disproportionately higher prevalence of ESRD, yet receive fewer kidney transplants compared to non-Hispanic whites. Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the treatment of choice for ESRD as it confers better patient and graft survival, shorter waiting time, and better quality of life than deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, compared to their representation on the waiting list, fewer Hispanics received a LDKT than non-Hispanic whites in 2013: 4 percent versus 10 percent. Barriers to LDKT for Hispanics include: lack of knowledge, cultural concerns, and language barriers. The disparity will likely worsen without intervention as Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the US.  Few available culturally competent interventions have led to increased LDKT rates. Interventions rarely address Hispanic cultural concerns, and there are no published models of transplant center-based only programs. The Chicago Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program (HKTP), a culturally and linguistically competent program, has increased Hispanic LDKTs. The mean annual ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs grew from 0.20 in 2001-2006 to 0.34 in 2008-2013, a 70 percent increase (p<0.001).  The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the HKTP, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations (Dallas, TX, and Los Angeles, CA), with Northwestern University serving as the Study Coordinating Center. The pre-post HKTP intervention study will evaluate the effect of the HKTP's key culturally sensitive components (outreach, communication, education) on Hispanic LDKT rates, compared to matched controls. The specific aims are to:  1. Implement the HKTP at two transplant centers by conducting a needs assessment of barriers and using a ""learning collaborative"" model to deliver HKTP protocols, scripts, and materials.  2. Conduct a pre-post HKTP intervention evaluation with matched controls to assess if the HKTP is associated with an increase in: a) the ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs as a function of an absolute increase in Hispanic LDKTs, b) ESRD Hispanic patient additions to the waiting list, c) Hispanic potential donors per potential recipient, and d) Hispanic patients' satisfaction with care.  3. Formatively evaluate the fidelity and innovative adaptations to HKTP's outreach, communication, and education at both study sites to identify effective components of the HTKP, using mixed methods.  As an exploratory aim, a budget impact analysis will be conducted to construct a business case for transplant centers and permit estimates of HKTP scalability. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally, improve health outcomes for Hispanics, and close the LDKT disparity gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic/Latino patients with end-stage renal disease are disproportionately less likely to get a kidney transplant, and specifically, a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, without LDKTs, Hispanics experience longer transplant waiting times, shorter patient and graft survival, and worse quality of life. Cultural beliefs and linguistic barriers contribute to the disparity in LDKTs. The objectie of the proposed study is to implement and evaluate Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations.

"integrating conservative kidney management options and advance care planning into a pre-dialysis educational program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pre-dialysis education programs are the standard of care for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) to learn about their options for treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, these programs do not usually include education about conservative kidney management (CKM) or advance care planning. Informed decision-making about dialysis treatments becomes especially important for elderly and frail patients with advanced CKD as they may experience frequent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and early death once they are initiated on dialysis. There are also racial disparities in dialysis knowledge, advance care planning and end-of-life (EOL) preferences between Black and White patients with advanced CKD that have been attributed to Blacks having less understanding of their treatment options. Advance care planning education has been used to improve decision-making among diverse cohorts of chronic hemodialysis patients however the integration of CKM and advance care planning education into pre-dialysis education programs in order to improve knowledge and communication of care options while also reducing racial disparities has not been well studied. The proposed scientific program has three research aims: (1) To conduct an open pilot study of an educational intervention (Conservative Kidney Management Options and Advance Care Planning Education – COPE) that is integrated into standard pre-dialysis education among frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD to assess its feasibility and acceptability, (2) To test, in a pilot randomized controlled trial, the preliminary efficacy of COPE on improving knowledge of CKM and advance care planning and increasing communication about ESRD treatment and EOL care preferences among frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD, and (3) To explore whether COPE reduces racial disparities in CKM and advance care planning knowledge as well as communication of ESRD and EOL care preferences among Black and White frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD. Dr. Eneanya proposes a career development program that includes methodological training and mentorship by senior faculty to develop and evaluate knowledge assessment tools, engage effectively with seriously ill patient populations, and pilot an intervention to detect racial differences in treatment knowledge and end-of-life communication. The long-term goal of this career development award is to develop Dr. Eneanya into an independent health services researcher with expertise in survey research methods, informed decision-making models of care, and clinical trials among minority and renal populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the United States, elderly and frail patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly initiated on dialytic treatments despite the unclear effects on mortality and quality of life for this population. Furthermore, racial minority patients are diagnosed more frequently with advanced CKD but experience barriers to informed dialysis decision-making and quality end-of-life care. The proposed study seeks to test a pre-dialysis educational intervention to promote informed treatment decision-making, improve advance care planning, and decrease racial disparities in treatment knowledge and communication of care preferences among Black and White frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD.",integrating conservative kidney management options and advance care planning into a pre-dialysis educational program,9534615,K23DK114526,"['Acids ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Anemia ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electrolytes ', ' Family ', ' Fluid Balance ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Program Development ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' frail older adult ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' education planning ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical study ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Process ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' end-of-life communication ', ' end of life communication ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Secure ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' senior faculty ', ' full professor ', ' racial minority ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' physical symptom ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2019,167940,0.07383286432006815
"Diet and Hypertension Management in Chronic Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract: Excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among Black Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant US public health disparity. Compared to their White counterparts, Blacks with CKD develop kidney disease earlier in life, are 3 times more likely to develop kidney failure necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation, and are 1.5 times more likely to die prematurely from CVD. Hypertension, which is also more prevalent, more severe, and less often controlled in Blacks with CKD compared to Whites, is a leading cause of CKD and CVD, and a major contributor to the racial disparity in CVD mortality. Therefore, improving hypertension in Blacks with CKD could have a profound positive impact on an important minority health issue. The long-term career goal of Dr. Crystal Tyson, who is a nephrologist and hypertension specialist, is to develop sustainable interventions that improve hypertension and eliminate racial disparities in CVD among adults with CKD. In her formative work, Dr. Tyson conducted a pilot metabolic feeding study which demonstrated that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH) lowers BP in Black adults with CKD without having adverse effects on metabolic markers of safety. In this application, Dr. Tyson will move her research forward by modifying an existing DASH counseling intervention that was previously demonstrated by her mentors (Svetkey, Lin) to improve DASH adherence and BP in racially diverse, non-CKD populations, to now specifically address cultural and disease-specific considerations of Blacks with CKD. For Aim 1, she will conduct formative qualitative research involving focus group discussions with Black adults with hypertension and CKD to identify barriers and facilitators of DASH adherence. For Aim 2, she will conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to test feasibility, acceptability, and the preliminary effect on DASH adherence and BP of the newly-modified intervention in 50 Black patients with hypertension and CKD. During the award period, Dr. Tyson will train to develop (1) new skills in qualitative research methods, (2) new skills to conduct behavioral and diet interventions in minority and CKD populations, and (3) enhanced skills in health disparities and minority health research methods. Her highly-accomplished, multi-disciplinary mentorship team will be led by Laura Svetkey, MD, MHS, an internationally recognized hypertension and clinical trial expert who has received several institutional awards for her leadership in faculty diversity and mentoring. Dr. Tyson’s team will also include national leaders in CKD-related health disparities (L. Ebony Boulware, MD, MPH), behavioral intervention and dissemination research (Gary Bennett, PhD, MPH), qualitative research methods (Laura Fish, PhD), and biostatistics (Jane Pendergast, PhD). By accomplishing the research aims and training objectives of this career development award, Dr. Tyson will be prepared to successfully transition to research independence and develop broadly implementable interventions that help eliminate racial disparities in CVD among CKD populations. Project Narrative High blood pressure (BP) control rates are low among Black Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which causes Blacks with CKD to die prematurely from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of the proposed study is to develop a behavioral diet counseling intervention that is specifically designed to lower BP in Black adults with CKD. This research has the potential to address an important public health need for therapies that are proven to improve BP control rates and reduce CVD death rates among Blacks with CKD.",Diet and

"Identifying and exploring solutions to the ethical challenges of ApoL1 testing of donors with recent African ancestry through mixed methods research with stakeholders PROJECT SUMMARY Blacks in the United States have a higher incidence of end-stage kidney disease than the general population; much, but not all, of this excess risk is attributed to variants in the ApoL1 gene. The ApoL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes (APOLLO) Network was established to address the role, if any, of ApoL1 testing in kidney transplantation. The APOLLO Network will enroll and genotype approximately 700 LD and 1600 DD while tracking outcomes for LD and recipients. All participants will have the option to receive their ApoL1 test results after enrollment ends. The APOLLO Network has the potential to increase understanding of kidney health disparities among Blacks and improve transplantation outcomes. However, the introduction of ApoL1 testing risks stigmatizing Black organ donors, reducing the number of Black LD, and worsening disparities. It also raises a series of ethical questions about clinical practices: who to test, how to use test results, and with whom to share results. We propose a 3-year ancillary R01 project that will be relevant not only to the APOLLO Network, but to future projects involving genetic testing that targets Black patients. Our team members serve on the APOLLO steering committee and community advisory council and have engaged diverse stakeholders in developing the following aims and research questions (RQ): Aim 1. Answer RQ1: Which factors influence participants' evaluation of competing ApoL1 testing clinical practices and engagement with ApoL1 test results? a. Administer a web-based survey to APOLLO participants that assesses the acceptability of competing ApoL1 clinical practices. b. Determine factors that predict APOLLO participants' attitudes toward diverse ApoL1 clinical policies, and whether participants access their ApoL1 test results. Aim 2. Answer RQ2: What are participant experiences with the return of ApoL1 testing results? a. Administer a survey to 600 participants who access their ApoL1 test results to assess comprehension of information, satisfaction or regret with testing, and intentions to use this information. b. Conduct qualitative interviews to explore the reasons behind participants' decision whether to receive ApoL1 test results, and examine the impact of these decisions on participants and family members. Aim 3. Answer RQ3: Is it feasible to use a Delphi panel process to obtain an informed consensus among diverse stakeholder groups on ApoL1 testing clinical practices? a. We will use a Delphi panel process with representation from all DD family members, DD recipients, LD, LD recipients, and transplant personnel. Project Narrative Blacks in the United States have a higher incidence of end-stage kidney disease than the general population; much, but not all, of this excess risk is attributed to variants in the ApoL1 gene. We will conduct surveys and interviews with individuals who are undergoing ApoL1 testing in the context of a larger organ transplantation research study (APOLLO) in order to explore ethical and social issues. We will work with a diverse panel of stakeholders to establish a consensus on key clinical practices surrounding ApoL1 testing in the context of organ transplantation.",Identifying and exploring solutions to the ethical challenges of ApoL1 testing of donors with recent African ancestry through mixed methods research with stakeholders,9801357,R01MD014161,"['Attitude ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Survey ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Regrets ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' RQ2 ', ' Comprehension ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' instrument ', ' Living Donors ', ' Consensus ', ' Test Result ', ' Allografting ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Organ Transplant Research ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' organ allocation ', ' data sharing ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genetic counselor ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' recruit ', ' transplant centers ', ' cognitive interview ', ' ']",NIMHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,448451,0.12456444997403834
"Reaching Equity for Adults and CHildren in Transplant (REACH-TRANSPLANT) PROJECT ABSTRACT For over two decades, blacks and Hispanics have been less likely to receive kidney transplantation than non- Hispanic whites (NHWs), especially from a living donor (LD). Many studies have focused on recipient-related barriers that may contribute to these disparities, but less attention has been paid to how these disparities may arise during recipient and LD evaluation, LD selection, and LD follow-up. For instance, our current system for the evaluation of transplant candidacy recommends referral to transplant centers when the recipient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is < 30mL/min/1.73 m2, and allows for waitlist registration when the eGFR is <20mL/min/1.73 m2. However, kidney disease is known to progress more rapidly among blacks and Hispanics (vs. NHWs), so donors to a black or Hispanic (vs. NHW) recipient may have less time to complete their workup before the need for dialysis arises in the recipient. Black donors have also been noted to have higher risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to white donors after donation. Heightened awareness of the higher ESRD risk among prior black LDs may predispose to reduced acceptance of even healthy black living donor candidates (the majority of whom donate to black recipients), thereby diminishing the pool of LDs. Finally, lack of consistent medical follow-up of prior LDs may reduce opportunities for early prevention and intervention to reduce risk factors for the development of CKD, especially among black or Hispanic LDs. Sparse data are available regarding whether post-donation health monitoring differs by race/ethnicity, and whether risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) could be more optimally managed to mitigate the higher risk of ESRD among prior black/Hispanic LDs. If outcomes among black or Hispanic donors could be improved, access of black and Hispanic recipients to LDs could also improve. In this proposal, our goal is to examine whether 1) use of a risk-based threshold (vs. an absolute eGFR threshold) to guide when we refer patients for transplant candidacy (and donor) evaluation may improve inequities in the time available for transplant preparation by race/ethnicity (Aim 1); 2) differential acceptance of black or Hispanic (vs. NHW) donor candidates overall, and by provider or transplant center, are occurring despite the availability of objective metrics of donor ESRD risk (Aim 2); 3) post-donation health monitoring and risk factor modification is inadequate among black and Hispanic (vs. NHW) LDs (Aim 3). To accomplish our aims, we will use electronic health record data collected prospectively and retrospectively from transplant centers across the US (Aims 1-2) and prospectively recruit LDs for Aim 3. Data from this proposal will inform the design of multi- level interventions to improve disparities in transplant outcomes, including 1) better acknowledgement of variations in the rate of CKD progression when planning the timing of transplant referral; 2) increased use of objective metrics of ESRD risk during donor evaluation; and 3) enhanced compliance with post-donation health monitoring with the goal of providing early risk factor modification to improve donor outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the long-standing observed racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation and donor outcomes. We propose to identify whether lower access of blacks and Hispanics to transplantation, especially from a living donor, may be related to system- level barriers within our donor evaluation, selection, and follow-up process, and heightened concerns for adverse outcomes among black and Hispanic living donors.",Reaching Equity for Adults and CHildren in Transplant (REACH-TRANSPLANT),9886791,R01DK120886,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Data Collection ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' parity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' tool ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Impaired health ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' longterm followup ', ' long-term followup ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', "" National Children's Study "", ' high risk ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' screening ', ' recruit ', ' system-level barriers ', ' Wait Time ', ' transplant centers ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,723974,0.16300947532583893
"Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media Summary Over 90,000 individuals in the United States await kidney transplantation. Only about 12,000 will receive a deceased donor transplant each year, and recent efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, most candidates on the waiting list have a higher chance of dying than of being offered a deceased donor kidney. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) eliminates the wait and offers superior survival, but accounts for fewer than 6,000 additional transplants per year despite a huge potential pool of millions of adults living in the US. Worse, LDKT rates are lowest among Hispanic and African American candidates who account for over 30% of the waitlist. Regardless of race, known barriers to identifying a live donor include lack of education, reluctance to discuss one's illness, and hesitance to ask others to donate. We have developed two novel interventions to address these barriers. The first is a 6-month training program that combines education, advocacy, and instrumental support by pairing candidates with a live donor champion (LDC): a friend, family member, or community member trained to spread awareness of ESRD, LDKT, and the candidate's story throughout their social network. The second is a less-intensive Facebook (FB) app (designed in collaboration with FB leadership) that leverages the broad reach of social media to spread awareness, facilitating FB posts about the candidate's story, providing links to education about ESRD and LDKT, and documenting the candidate's search for a donor through a ""chronically viral"" Facebook story. In pilot studies at our center, participants of both interventions were significantly more likely to undergo LDKT compared to matched controls. While encouraging, pilot testing has been non-randomized and limited to our center and its unique patient population. Furthermore, it remains unclear how intense an intervention is necessary, i.e. the less-intense FB approach or the more-intense champion approach. To assess the real- world effectiveness of the LDC program and/or the Facebook app in expanding live donation among a heterogeneous population of waitlist candidates, we now propose to test these interventions at three busy transplant centers that serve a heterogeneous group of largely underserved patients. The relative dearth of deceased donors has caused a profound organ shortage; it is essential to turn to novel efforts that increase live donation. Development and widespread implementation of culturally competent LDC and Facebook App interventions has the potential to increase the overall incidence of LDKT while also addressing disparities in access to LDKT.   Public Health Relevance There is a crisis in the United States with over 100,000 people on the transplant waitlist. Efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful so we must now turn to living donation to confront the shortage. Barriers to increasing living donation are largely due to communication, thus we look to novel interventions using social media and social networks to address the problem. Pilot programs with these interventions have proven successful at our center and we now wish to test dissemination to other centers, especially those caring for some of our most underserved patients.",Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media,9923125,R01DK111966,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Awareness ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Leadership ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Friends ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Organ ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' social media ', ' transplant centers ', ' Facebook ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,88432,0.14033710212403408
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,9676904,R01HL141892,"['Affect ', ' Albumins ', ' Restrictive Cardiomyopathy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' heart transplant ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' cardiac graft ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Insurance ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' liver transplantation ', ' lung transplant ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' Lung Transplantation ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Patient Rights ', ' Perfusion ', ' survival sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' commercial sex ', ' Prostitution ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Whiskers ', ' Vibrissae ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Hepatic Failure ', ' Liver Failure ', ' forest ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Hypoalbuminemia ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Knowledge ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' EFRAC ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' time use ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transplant registry ', ' transplant database ', ' transplant data base ', ' clinical practice ', ' mathematical methods ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' cardiac cachexia ', ' improved outcome ', ' transplant centers ', ' cardiac device ', ' cardiodevice ', ' risk prediction model ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' post-transplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2019,795898,0.06913361874510784
"Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to transplant are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the transplant process. In 2014, our SEKTx Coalition conducted a randomized, multicomponent intervention (Reducing Disparities In Access to kidNey Transplantation [RaDIANT]) Community Study in GA, the state with the lowest kidney transplant rates in the nation, consisting of patient- and provider-focused educational and engagement interventions designed to increase referral for transplant evaluation among AA ESRD patients. This study was effective in improving referral for kidney transplantation among AA in GA, but efforts to improve access to kidney transplantation must be expanded beyond GA and should include interventions targeting steps beyond referral to the medical evaluation at the transplant center. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to eliminate racial disparities in every step of the kidney transplant process. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine reasons for racial disparities in medical evaluation for kidney transplantation among dialysis patients in GA, NC and SC. Specific Aim 2: Implement the RaDIANT Regional Study in GA, NC, and SC with the goal of increasing rates of referral, medical evaluation, and waitlisting, and reducing disparities in these key steps. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a process and outcome evaluation of the RaDIANT Regional Study interventions. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant access among the AA ESRD population in the Southeast and reduce health disparities in transplantation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of kidney disease is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. The proposed study seeks to leverage an existing academic-community collaboration with the Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention targeting End Stage Renal Disease patients and dialysis facility staff in reducing racial disparities in access t kidney transplantation.",Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study,9604712,U01MD010611,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Maintenance ', ' North Carolina ', ' parity ', ' Patient advocacy ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Facility Controls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' quality improvement organization ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' volunteer ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' surveillance data ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' intervention cost ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' transplant centers ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,604377,0.13970851774364518
"Evaluation of Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation in New National Kidney Allocation Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The public health burden of kidney failure in the United States is substantial, with more than 600,000 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. There are two main treatments for kidney disease - dialysis or kidney transplantation. A complex, multi-tiered national system regulates kidney disease care, reimbursement, and transplantation, creating barriers to overcoming the significant racial disparities that exist in transplantation, the most effective treatment for ESRD. The federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network of the United Network for Organ Sharing oversees the allocation of all deceased donor organs in the US, and on Dec. 4, 2014, a major change to the allocation policy was implemented that is expected to impact racial disparities in transplantation access. We propose to study the impact of the natural experiment offered by enactment of this new kidney allocation policy on reducing disparities in the key steps of referral for transplant evaluation, wit listing, and transplantation, each of which have complexities for measurement at the local and national level. In addition, to impact disparities reduction at the service delivery level, we willuse national data to develop and then disseminate a systems-level practice of providing feedback to dialysis centers about their transplant performance to improve overall wait listing rates and decrease disparities in kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the new kidney allocation policy will lead to a reduction in disparities in transplantation at 1 year, we will prospectively examine the impact of the policy changes on racial disparities in the key steps in the transplant process post- vs. pre- allocation: a) referra from the dialysis facility for transplant evaluation in the Southeast, where we have access to this unique data, and b) wait listing and transplantation in the US. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of a systems-level approach to providing tailored transplant performance feedback and education about the kidney allocation policy, we will conduct a multicomponent, clinical effectiveness-implementation study among 750 US dialysis facilities which treat >50,000 dialysis patients. We anticipate that increasing provider knowledge will reduce disparities in transplant wait listing. The long-term impact of this application will be to influence the way organs are allocated in the US to ensure equitability through better analysis of policy and dissemination of best practices at the health systems level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study seeks to examine whether a change in the national kidney allocation policy resulted in a reduction in racial disparities in access to ke steps to kidney transplantation, and to leverage a systems-based approach to conduct a national effectiveness-implementation study of a tailored performance feedback report among US dialysis facilities with racial disparities in transplant wait listing.",Evaluation of Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation in New National Kidney Allocation Policy,9614800,R01MD010290,"['racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Wait Time ', ' service delivery ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Feedback ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Methodology ', ' National Health Policy ', ' North Carolina ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' South Carolina ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Wit ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' organ procurement transplantation network ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' federal policy ', ' organ allocation ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,505357,0.14107272964431145
"Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program Project Summary/Abstract The applicant for this competing renewal of a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is James Lash, MD, a Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). During the initial four years of support by this award, Dr. Lash has had a strong record of mentorship and research productivity. During this time, his productivity as a mentor has increased significantly as reflected by 25 trainee-led manuscripts, the receipt of four K23 awards and one Diversity Supplement, the academic promotion of two faculty members, and the proposed promotion of two others. Of note, over one-half of Dr. Lash's trainees are underrepresented minorities. Dr. Lash's research focuses on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a particular emphasis on minority populations. He has considerable experience as a patient- oriented researcher and is the Principal Investigator for several NIH-sponsored studies: 1) the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study UIC Clinical Center, 2) the Hispanic CRIC Study, and 3) the UIC PI for the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). In addition, during the funding period his research portfolio has further expanded with him becoming PI for the Fogarty International Center-sponsored Mexico CRIC Study based in Mexico City, Co-PI for the NHLBI-funded Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Chicago Field Center, and Associate Director for a T32 program focused on health disparities in minority populations. This comprehensive research program provides a wealth of opportunities for his trainees. The overarching objective of the proposed new research program for this K24 renewal is to evaluate the impact of two potentially modifiable health behaviors (sedentary behavior and sleep) on health outcomes in patients with CKD. This research will leverage Dr. Lash's leadership role in large ongoing observational studies with substantial representation of racial/ethnic minorities. In addition, the research program will also include a pilot intervention focused on reducing sedentary behavior and improving sleep quality in adults with CKD. In addition to its focus on areas of significance, the proposed research will provide trainees with a rich range of opportunities in patient-oriented research in CKD. Trainees will also participate in didactic training through the School of Public Health and have access to the extensive resources and infrastructure provided by the Center for Clinical Translational Science. The renewal of this K24 award will provide Dr. Lash with the protected time and resources to continue to expand his successful research program and continue to provide productive mentorship of new physician scientists to develop the skills needed to become independent investigators in kidney disease research. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing numbers of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The strengths of this K24 renewal application are as follows: the applicant's robust research program focusing on chronic kidney disease in minorities, his successful track record in mentoring new clinician investigators during the first period of funding, the comprehensive plan for mentoring and developing the careers of new physician scientists, the strong institutional support and resources at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and an innovative research proposal investigating the impact of two potentially modifiable health behaviors (sedentary behavior and sleep) on health outcomes

"American Indian Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study (AI-CRIC) Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Shah, Vallabh O and Unruh Mark Despite experiencing high levels of kidney disease compared to other ethnic/racial groups in the United States, American Indians (AIs) continue to receive relatively little attention from researchers studying CKD. An example is the current CRIC study, where less than 1% of participants in this flagship study are AIs. Risk factors for diabetic kidney disease, the predominant form of CKD in this population, include the traditional risk factors of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and inheritance, but also other factors such as exposure to various persistent environmental pollutants. The distribution and determinants of CKD among AIs has been understudied, leaving many questions unanswered about the progression of CKD among AIs, as well as the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the setting of CKD among these populations. This is an urgent issue given the public health impact in AI communities and the relative lack of ongoing research. To address this burden of CKD in Native communities we have formed a consortium of investigators with extensive experience in conducting research of chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney disease in AIs of Southwestern US. Our proposed CRIC ancillary cohort study of 500 AIs (AI-CRIC) will rapidly improve our understanding of both potential risk factors for CKD progression, as well as the scope of this disease among AIs. This proposal leverages the current CRIC study and incorporates the planned activities of the next phase of the study – “CRIC 2018” – by implementing contemporary CRIC protocols for kidney and cardiovascular measurement and outcomes. The overall goal of the proposed prospective cohort study is to precisely assess the extent to which there are higher rates of CKD/CVD progression in AIs than in other racial/ethnic groups based on standardized definitions used throughout CRIC and relate CKD to the levels of potential environmental and occupational exposures unique to AIs residing in the American Southwest. To better understand the natural history of CKD/CVD in this high-risk population, AI-CRIC will implement the CRIC 2018 protocol of ambulatory monitoring of kidney function and damage along with evaluations of CVD sub-phenotypes using mobile health technologies. We will address these overarching goals with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Conduct a longitudinal study of a CKD cohort of southwest AIs to identify unique risk factors for CKD and CVD progression and compare CKD and CVD event rates and risk factors between AI and other populations represented in CRIC; Specific Aim 2: Conduct ambulatory monitoring of kidney function and damage, and evaluate its relationship with exposure data; Specific Aim 3: Conduct CVD sub-phenotyping using mobile health technologies and evaluate its relationship with exposures data. This proposal takes advantage of the ongoing data collection and expertise of the CRIC study to address a gap in our understanding of CKD progression among AI. Ultimately, AI-CRIC will rapidly inform our understanding of the burden of CKD and provide disparity-reducing interventions. Importantly, the AI-CRIC addresses both an overarching goal of Healthy People 2020 to increase equity and reduce disparities and a priority issue for the American Society of Nephrology.

"2/2 APOL1 Long-Term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network- Clinical Center Project Summary (Abstract) The Columbia-Penn Clinical Consortium (CPCC) brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team of clinical and basic scientist investigators at Columbia University Medical Center and University of Pennsylvania Transplant Programs. The CPCC investigators have expertise in the fields of transplant epidemiology, immunology, genetics and ethics, as well as an extensive history of collaboration with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and other CPCC member transplant programs. As a result, the CPCC is well suited to recruit and retain patients for longitudinal follow up for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Research Network (APOLLO). This proposed Clinical Center will comprise of 26 pediatric and adult large, medium and small size transplant centers and 9 organ procurement organizations predominantly in four contiguous states (NY, NJ, CT and PA) in the northeast US. Our primary objective is to enroll all donors of African ancestry (e.g. African-Americans and Black Hispanic) and their recipients within the consortium for genetic and genomic studies by the APOLLO Network (Aim 1). We will follow all recruited donor-recipient pairs with longitudinal collection of biospecimens and clinical outcomes along with pragmatic integration with Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), UNOS and the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data (Aim 2). Our experience in the recruitment and retention of minority patients in multicenter studies, as well as the use of innovative analytics with linkage to UNOS, USRDS and other geospatial data, will be of benefit to the APOLLO Network. We expect that our unique design and implementation expertise to the APOLLO study will address the hypothesis that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants is associated with inferior allograft outcomes following kidney transplant and increases the risk of adverse renal outcomes for affected living donors. Project Narrative The APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Research Network (APOLLO) aims to determine the impact of APOL1 genetic variants on transplant outcomes for recipients of kidneys from donors of African ancestry (e.g. African-Americans and Black Hispanics). The Columbia-Penn Clinical Consortium for APOLLO (CPCC-APOLLO) will recruit and follow-up all donor-recipient pairs involving donors with African heritage from 26 transplant centers and 9 organ procurement organizations predominantly in 4 contiguous states (NY, NJ, CT and PA) for genetic and genomic studies by the APOLLO Network.",2/2 APOL1 Long-Term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network- Clinical Center,9772131,U01DK116066,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Censuses ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Heterozygote ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Trypanosomiasis ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Immunology ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Collaborations ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' FSGS ', ' System ', ' Allografting ', ' Penetrance ', ' psychosocial ', ' Inferior ', ' experience ', ' gene interaction ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Genomics ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' organ procurement transplantation network ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' high risk ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Genetic study ', ' Retrospective cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' transplant centers ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' ']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2019,814740,0.14066469132487663
"(PQ2) Donor socioeconomic status as a predictor of altered immune function and treatment response following hematopoietic cell transplantation for hematologic malignancy ABSTRACT Patients with high risk or relapsed hematological malignancies may be cured using allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); however, HCT carries a significant risk of mortality. Our group has identified that this risk is disproportionately worse among recipients of low socioeconomic status (SES). HCT is increasingly used to treat a variety of malignancies and hematologic disorders, yet social adversity continues to account for higher rates of morbidity and mortality from this cancer treatment. We have previously identified a recipient- level SES-related immunobiologic factor implicated in adverse allogeneic HCT patient outcomes - a gene expression pattern termed the “conserved transcriptional response to adversity” (CTRA). A significant component of the CTRA profile is pro-inflammatory. Reciprocally, several donor-level characteristics are important in predicting allogeneic HCT outcomes. Further, donor cells engraft in the recipient, such that subsequent hematopoiesis is donor-derived. Despite this, it is not known whether donor immunobiologic disparities associated with SES confer additional prognostic risk to HCT recipients. The goal of this research project is to identify SES-related donor-level immunobiologic risk factors for adverse HCT outcomes. The primary aims of this proposal are to: 1) quantify how donor SES alters recipient HCT outcomes; 2) determine the relationship between donor SES and gene expression and the effect of donor gene expression on recipient HCT outcomes; and 3) evaluate the interaction of donor and recipient SES on clinical outcomes and quantify the combined effects of donor and recipient gene expression on clinical outcomes. Our overarching hypothesis is that SES-related pro-inflammatory gene expression patterns in donors will be associated with inferior recipient HCT outcomes, and that this effect will be synergistic with recipient gene expression patterns in influencing recipient outcomes. The research plan employs molecular biology and immunologic techniques to investigate immunobiologic factors underlying health disparities by collaborating with the federally funded Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). We will leverage the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of principal investigators, co-investigators, and consultants by using clinical (N=2840) and biological (N=184) HCT donor data. We will examine the association between donor CTRA and related transcriptome dynamics and recipient allogeneic transplant outcomes - including disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, relapse risk, graft-versus-host disease, and overall survival – as well as the relationships between donor and recipient immunobiologic patterning on response to HCT. This translational study builds upon our prior research, explores the transplantable nature of donor sociodemographic factors on cancer biology, and lays the critical groundwork for interventions targeting SES-related donor health to improve cancer outcomes. In sum, the proposed work will further define our biologic mechanistic understanding of social health disparities in cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accumulating evidence indicates that low socioeconomic status (SES) in the hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipient is associated with adverse transplant outcomes, and recent data have shown that up- regulation of a stress-related immunologic gene expression profile in the transplant recipient may represent a socially-mediated biological explanation for this finding. Interestingly, allogeneic HCT involves the replacement of the recipient’s immune system with that of a healthy donor; this led to the current proposal in which we will explore the impact of donor SES and immunologic gene expression on recipient HCT outcomes. This research will significantly extend our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms and pathways underlying the comorbidity of social health disparities in cancer - particularly within the biologically unique setting of HCT – and will provide a critical link for designing effective interventions to reduce cancer disparities.",(PQ2) Donor socioeconomic status as a predictor of altered immune function and treatment response following hematopoietic cell transplantation for hematologic malignancy,9732989,R01CA238562,"['Affect ', ' Angiogenic Factor ', ' Angiogenesis Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' graft vs. host disease ', ' graft versus host disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' GvHD ', ' graft vs host disease ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood cell formation ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Immunogenetics ', ' Immunological Techniques ', ' Immunological Technics ', ' Immunologic Technics ', ' Immunologic Techniques ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' leukemia ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Methodology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Wake Forest APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all US kidney transplants from African American kidney donors to determine their effect on transplant outcomes. In addition, the post- donation health and kidney function of African American living kidney donors will be assessed. We are applying to be the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC) for this NIH Funding Announcement. Shorter renal allograft survival is observed for transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors, relative to deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute to the disparity. These variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease, but rare in other racial/ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients in order to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. This information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation are made and regarding the safety of living kidney donation. Before this genotypic data can be used clinically, a prospective national study is required to evaluate all kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from retrospective studies needs to be collected, including recipient APOL1 genotypes, renal histologic data in failed allografts and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. We will perform the following activities for the APOLLO Network: overall study coordination, assist with preparation of the final protocol and Manual of Procedures, develop data tracking tools and the study website, collect and archive clinical and outcomes data, perform genotyping, statistical analyses, assessment of the primary outcome “time to allograft failure in transplanted kidneys from African American donors, based on donor APOL1 genotypes” and create a bio-repository. We will longitudinally assess vital status, kidney function and proteinuria in living African American kidney donors based on APOL1 genotypes. Prospective assessment of the effects of kidney donor APOL1 genotypes on serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria in transplant recipients with functioning allografts will also be performed. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Genetic information in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) from African American donors of kidneys and transplant recipients may provide more accurate assessments of the likelihood of long-term survival of transplanted kidneys and optimize matching of donors with recipients. This application is submitted in response to the National Institutes of Health request for applications for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Scientific and Data Research Center and proposes to prospectively evaluate effects of donor and recipient APOL1 genotypes in kidney transplants from African American donors performed at all US transplant programs.

"Patient-Oriented Research Addressing Disparities in Hypertension and Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a proposal for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research for Deidra C. Crews, MD, ScM of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dr. Crews is an Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology, Core Faculty in the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, and Associate Director for Research Development in the Center for Health Equity. Dr. Crews has spent the majority of her career and scholarship focused on patient-oriented research in disadvantaged populations with hypertension and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and CKD, and socioeconomic factors contribute to these disparities. Racial disparities in CKD are most profound among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Low socioeconomic status (SES) and limited availability of healthy foods contribute to poor dietary patterns which influence CKD risk. There is evidence from observational studies that adherence to healthy dietary patterns, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, may substantially reduce risk of CKD and short-term randomized trials suggest the adoption of a healthy diet in adults with CKD may reduce risk of disease progression. The important problem to be addressed by the applicant over the proposed 5-year K24 award period is that low SES African Americans with hypertension and CKD face multiple barriers to healthful eating which can lead to their poor outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and ESRD. This K24 award will protect time for the applicant to mentor junior investigators and conduct significant research aimed at developing sustainable dietary interventions for individuals at high risk for poor clinical outcomes related to hypertension and CKD. The proposed original research will be conducted in the context of the Five, Plus Nuts and Beans for Kidneys trial, a randomized controlled dietary intervention study of low SES African Americans with hypertension and CKD, and will (a) elucidate experiences of recent intervention-arm (Coaching-DASH) participants determining their views on intervention components and factors facilitating or impeding their dietary changes, (b) examine the purchase patterns of the usual care group (Shopping-DASH), who received a trackable gift card to a local grocer but no guidance on purchases and (c) characterize and determine the impact of financial resource strain (defined as housing and/or food insecurity) on the primary and secondary outcomes of the trial—reductions in urinary albumin excretion and blood pressure. These aims will be addressed while Dr. Crews provides mentorship to new and existing junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows and students. Work performed during the K24 award will both inform future intervention design and implementation approaches to maximize sustainability of the applicant’s work, and will allow her to more effectively pursue her long-term career goals to improve outcomes for disadvantaged populations with or at risk for CKD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Racial/ethnic minorities and low income individuals are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease, including a 3 to 4-fold greater risk of kidney failure among African Americans as compared to whites. Effective, sustainable interventions to reduce these disparities are needed urgently. This application will support a practicing nephrologist and researcher with a longstanding commitment to understanding and addressing these disparities in her efforts to gain new knowledge in implementation research methods while also providing outstanding mentorship for junior investigators developing research to achieve health equity.",Patient-Oriented Research Addressing Disparities in

"The effect of socioeconomic status and environment characteristics on disparate postdonation health outcomes between Black and White living kidney donors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Each year in the US, 6000+ healthy individuals donate a kidney to a loved one, friend or stranger amounting to 142,111 individuals who have donated since 1988. For these healthy individuals, live donor nephrectomy is associated with a 25-40% decline in renal function, which increases their risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, recent evidence suggests that Black living kidney donors are at an even higher risk of these long-term morbidities than White donors. The 15-year postdonation risk of ESRD for Black donors is 154 per 10,000 compared to 49 per 10,000 for White donors. While compelling evidence points to genetic risk factors as key components of this difference, a substantial knowledge gap exists regarding the contribution of socioeconomic status (SES) and local environment of donors. Routine postdonation follow-up and care management could potentially identify early events on the pathway to CKD and ESRD – including diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN) and glomerulonephritis (GN) as these conditions are easily detected with routine vital signs, and blood and urine tests. Our group recently reported that only 50% of transplant hospitals achieve the mandated, routine follow-up for their donors. Further, follow- up attrition is associated with donors that are young, black, male, uninsured, and with fewer years of education. It is possible that socioeconomic and local environment disadvantage may potentiate follow-up attrition and increase rate of progression to CKD/ESRD in an already genetically at risk population. To better understand the impact of SES and environment on post-donation CKD/ESRD, we will leverage a major, ongoing, R01-funded, multicenter study that uses survey data linked to administrative databases to address the following aims: (1) To characterize the SES and local environment resources of Black vs. White living kidney donors; (2) To quantify the postdonation risk of CKD/ESRD attributable to low SES and disadvantaged environments; and (3) To examine health behavior of Black vs. White donors according to SES and environment. These aims are highly feasible given the rich primary data collection of parent study. We hypothesize that Black and White donors with low SES and from disadvantaged environments will have a higher incidence of postdonation DM, HTN, GN and CKD/ESRD. If the proposed aims are achieved, we will have a better understanding of which variables modify the relationship between race and outcomes and at what threshold of social disadvantage a difference is observed. It could also change clinical practice by 1) informing personalized follow-up care plans based on donor social circumstances, and (2) preventing exclusion of disadvantaged populations from national-based monitoring interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the US, the 6000+ healthy individuals who donate a kidney to a loved one, friend or stranger amounting to a total of 142,111 individuals who have donated since 1988, will experience a 25-40% decline in renal function, which increases their risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Recent evidence suggests that Black living kidney donors are at an even higher risk of these long- term morbidities than White donors, and while compelling evidence points to genetic risk factors as key drivers of the disparity, the relative contribution of socioeconomic status (SES) and environmental context is unknown. The goal of the proposed research project is to better understand the impact of socioeconomic status and local environment characteristics on postdonation CKD/ESRD, which will be immediately clinically applicable as it will (1) inform personalized follow-up care plans based on donor social circumstances, and (2) prevent exclusion of disadvantaged populations from national-based monitoring interventions.",The effect of socioeconomic status and environment characteristics on disparate postdonation health outcomes between Black and White living kidney donors,9689837,F32DK117563,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Censuses ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Heymann Nephritis ', ' Bright Disease ', ' Glomerulonephritis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Parents ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sickle Cell Trait ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Exclusion ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' clinical practice ', ' social health determinants ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' clinical investigation ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' recruit ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,79746,0.11721427369493041
"Differential survival selections and care-related determinants among African Americans and Hispanics versus whites with chronic kidney disease Project Summary This proposal represents our continuing efforts to contribute to NIDDK's Strategic Plan to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end-stage renal disease (ESRD; stage 5 CKD). Despite extensive research over the last two decades, critical knowledge gaps persist. First, African Americans (AAs) and Hispanics continue to have 2-3 times higher incidence of ESRD than non-Hispanic whites (whites), but paradoxically have much better survival than whites after reaching ESRD and undergoing dialysis. Speculation is that this apparent survival advantage is related to survival disadvantage and inadequate care for AAs and Hispanics during the pre-ESRD period, but confirming this has been hampered by methodological challenges. Second, we still do not understand how differences in mortality between minorities and whites evolve over time as the disease advances. And third, we do not fully grasp how processes of care, which are potentially modifiable and vital to improving outcomes, affect survival selections among minorities (vs. whites).  To close these longstanding knowledge gaps, we propose to conduct the first event-history analysis of national incident CKD populations to examine in-depth racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes and processes of care over the full course of CKD. Our central hypothesis is that differences in mortality between minorities (AAs and Hispanics) and whites are time-dependent over the course of CKD, and that differences in ESRD are related to the differences in pre-ESRD, which result from differential survival-selection processes between the groups. The analyses proposed under our three Specific Aims will test this and other specific hypotheses and examine a range of factors for the differential survival selections, particularly the processes of care. Aim 1 will yield a detailed characterization of how racial/ethnic differences in mortality evolve over the full course of CKD. Aim 2 will examine the effect of processes of care on differential survival selections among racial/ethnic groups, which drives the time-dependent changes found in Aim 1. Aim 3 will assess the role of unexplained risks in these differential survival-selection processes. In addition to our novel hypotheses and innovative analytic approaches, this study will foster methodological advances in CKD research, which include the use of 1) two national incident CKD cohorts with >15 years of follow-up that connect the pre-ESRD and ESRD periods—the national veteran CKD population (>1.3 million) for primary analyses, and the Medicare CKD population (>790,000) for further understanding of processes of care across the nation; and 2) advanced statistical techniques, including time-dependent multi-state survival models and frailty models. This study will offer novel understanding of why differential survival rates among AAs and Hispanics vs. whites exist and how they can be addressed. Our results for real-world processes of care among AAs and Hispanics can be directly translated into actionable initiatives to enhance care for minority CKD patients. Building on our team's outstanding record, we anticipate that our efforts will continue to be novel, productive and highly impactful. . Project Narrative Racial/ethnic disparities have persisted in multiple aspects of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end- stage renal disease (ESRD), from processes and quality of care to incidence of ESRD and outcomes. We will perform event-history analyses of large incident CKD cohorts to critically examine the causes of the racial/ethnic disparities along the entire spectrum from pre-ESRD to ESRD.

"Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media Summary Over 90,000 individuals in the United States await kidney transplantation. Only about 12,000 will receive a deceased donor transplant each year, and recent efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, most candidates on the waiting list have a higher chance of dying than of being offered a deceased donor kidney. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) eliminates the wait and offers superior survival, but accounts for fewer than 6,000 additional transplants per year despite a huge potential pool of millions of adults living in the US. Worse, LDKT rates are lowest among Hispanic and African American candidates who account for over 30% of the waitlist. Regardless of race, known barriers to identifying a live donor include lack of education, reluctance to discuss one's illness, and hesitance to ask others to donate. We have developed two novel interventions to address these barriers. The first is a 6-month training program that combines education, advocacy, and instrumental support by pairing candidates with a live donor champion (LDC): a friend, family member, or community member trained to spread awareness of ESRD, LDKT, and the candidate's story throughout their social network. The second is a less-intensive Facebook (FB) app (designed in collaboration with FB leadership) that leverages the broad reach of social media to spread awareness, facilitating FB posts about the candidate's story, providing links to education about ESRD and LDKT, and documenting the candidate's search for a donor through a ""chronically viral"" Facebook story. In pilot studies at our center, participants of both interventions were significantly more likely to undergo LDKT compared to matched controls. While encouraging, pilot testing has been non-randomized and limited to our center and its unique patient population. Furthermore, it remains unclear how intense an intervention is necessary, i.e. the less-intense FB approach or the more-intense champion approach. To assess the real- world effectiveness of the LDC program and/or the Facebook app in expanding live donation among a heterogeneous population of waitlist candidates, we now propose to test these interventions at three busy transplant centers that serve a heterogeneous group of largely underserved patients. The relative dearth of deceased donors has caused a profound organ shortage; it is essential to turn to novel efforts that increase live donation. Development and widespread implementation of culturally competent LDC and Facebook App interventions has the potential to increase the overall incidence of LDKT while also addressing disparities in access to LDKT.   Public Health Relevance There is a crisis in the United States with over 100,000 people on the transplant waitlist. Efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful so we must now turn to living donation to confront the shortage. Barriers to increasing living donation are largely due to communication, thus we look to novel interventions using social media and social networks to address the problem. Pilot programs with these interventions have proven successful at our center and we now wish to test dissemination to other centers, especially those caring for some of our most underserved patients.",Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media,9690698,R01DK111966,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Awareness ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Leadership ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Friends ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Organ ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' social media ', ' transplant centers ', ' Facebook ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,546304,0.14033710212403408
"Racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation. PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Kidney transplantation is the preferred modality of treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as it improves quality of life and survival for patients with ESRD. However, racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation are present in adults and children with chronic kidney disease. The lower access of black and Hispanic adults to kidney transplant has been ascribed to late referral for nephrology care, delayed referral for transplant evaluation, lower socioeconomic status, and differences in cultural beliefs or attitudes surrounding organ transplantation. However, the fact that similar racial and ethnic disparities are also present in children (who have better access to healthcare than adults, and for whom transplantation is the standard ESRD treatment modality) suggests that there may be additional barriers that contribute to these disparities. For example, some studies have suggested that chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses more rapidly in black and Hispanic patients, which could shorten the time available for transplant evaluation, waitlisting, and preemptive surgery during the advanced stages of CKD (prior to dialysis). In addition, since obesity is more prevalent in racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, and most transplant centers have body mass index criterion for transplantation and kidney donation, this policy may disproportionately disadvantage black or Hispanic recipients despite the absence of solid evidence that long-term allograft outcomes are worse in obese recipients. Donor perceptions regarding their own health, or transplant center's assessment of donor suitability, may also differ by donor race or ethnicity. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to evaluate disparities in transplant access in both adults and children within the context of medical risk factors (and policies surrounding these risk factors) that may disadvantage black or Hispanic patients, compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. In Aim 1, we propose to examine whether there are differences in the time spent in the advanced stages of CKD (stage 4 or 5) by race or ethnicity (when evaluation for waitlisting or transplantation typically occurs) using individual level data from four national CKD cohorts. In Aim 2, we propose to evaluate how body mass index may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in access to transplantation or suitability for kidney donation using data from the United States Renal Data System (recipients) and University of California San Francisco [UCSF] (donors). In Aim 3, we propose to establish a prospective study of potential living kidney donors to compare donor perceptions of their health with objective measures of donor risk and the transplant center's perception of donor suitability by race and ethnicity. UCSF is well-suited for the conduct of this proposal, given that it is one of the largest transplant centers in the US, performing 300-350 kidney transplants (including about 150 living donor transplants) annually. Our study will inform whether policy changes are needed to improve parity in access to kidney transplantation and will facilitate the design of additional strategies to enhance organ donation among racial and ethnic minorities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black and Hispanic patients with kidney disease have lower access to kidney transplantation compared to non- Hispanic white patients.

"Mentored patient-oriented research in disparities in cardiovascular and kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Gutiérrez is an Associate Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, Section Head of Outcomes and Epidemiology research in the Division of Nephrology, and Medical Director of the Bionutrition Unit in the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The long- term scientific goal of Dr. Gutiérrez is to build a patient-oriented research (POR) program focused on identifying novel strategies for reducing or eliminating disparities in health outcomes related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In order to accomplish this goal, Dr. Gutiérrez recognizes the critical importance of mentoring the next generation of clinician scientists who can develop the necessary expertise to investigate root causes of disparities in a comprehensive and ethical manner. However, the increasing demands on his time related to sustaining his professional effort for research as well as administrative and supervisory commitments pose a challenge towards his ability to grow his mentorship activities. This award will ensure Dr. Gutiérrez maintains the protected time to focus on POR related to disparities in CVD and CKD, a central component of which will involve mentoring junior investigators. His trainees will receive comprehensive training in POR centered on three main projects which focus on (1) the role of disordered mineral metabolism, (2) nutrition, (3) and novel pathways of kidney injury in explaining racial differences in CVD and CKD outcomes. This activities will be coupled with a robust program to enhance his skills as a mentor, with the ultimate goal of producing well-trained investigators committed to POR focused on disparities in health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Disparities in cardiovascular and kidney disease are among the biggest drivers of excess mortality in racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, costing billions of dollars a year. There is a need for investigators who have the appropriate training in patient-oriented research to identify reasons for disparities in cardiovascular and kidney disease and devise ways to overcome them.

"Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium Summary/Abstract Data demonstrate that transplanted kidneys from African American (AA) deceased donors are associated with reduced survival relative to kidneys from non-AA donors. Additional data demonstrate that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants, that are found exclusively in AA individuals, have been associated with an increased risk of CKD/ESRD in the general AA population. Two risk variants of this gene have a prevalence of 13% in AAs, and may account for some or all of the increased risk of transplant loss. There are also anecdotal reports of AA living kidney donors with two APOL1 risk variants developing ESRD raising further concerns. The APOLLO study proposes to enroll all deceased and living AA kidney donors in order to definitively address the impact of APOL1 variants on kidney transplant outcomes. The Emory APOLLO Clinical Centers consortium is comprised of 12 centers distributed across the US but focused in the Southeast. In 2015 these 12 programs transplanted 219 kidneys from deceased and living AA donors accounting for about 9% of all recipients of AA kidneys, the eligible study cohort in the US. The specific aims of our consortium are: (1) to perform APOL1 genotyping on all AA deceased and living kidney donors and create a sample repository for future studies to determine whether additional genetic factors contribute to the second hit postulated to be required for risk manifestation, (2) to compare the survival and function of all transplanted kidneys from AA donors to determine the impact of two APOL1 risk variants on transplant outcomes as well as exploring the potential of environmental factors (rejection, infections, comorbid conditions such as hypertension) to provide the second hit, and 3) to study whether African American living donors who carry two copies of the variant APOL1 genes are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease. Blood samples for APOL1 genotyping of deceased donors will be provided by the organ procurement organization, while the transplant centers will provide blood for genotyping recipients and living donors (as well as deceased donors when necessary). Demographic and clinical donor and recipient data will be provided by UNOS for all subjects. More granular clinical data will be provided for patients receiving their long-term follow up from one the 12 participating transplant centers. We propose enrolling subjects for 1 year and following them for 3 years thereby maximizing the likelihood of observing clinical events. The primary outcome measure for recipients of deceased donor kidneys is graft survival with secondary outcome measures assessing a variety of indicators of renal function and injury. As advance CKD or ESRD following living kidney donation are highly unlikely events, given the relatively short study duration the primary outcome for living kidney donors will be the change in renal function from the post-transplant baseline to the end of follow up at 3 years post-donation. When combined with the data from the other 14 APOLLO Clinical Center Consortia, we believe our data will contribute to a much more complete understanding of the impact of APOL1 gene variants on the outcomes of kidney transplantation and donation. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE STATEMENT: This study will improve the public health by determining if transplanted kidneys from African American donors who have two specific copies of variants of the apolipoprotein L1 gene (called APOL1) fail more rapidly than kidneys donated by African Americans without two variant copies of these genes. Should this study confirm the negative impact of the variant APOL1 genes this information would be very helpful for transplant professionals counseling patients in need of kidney transplantation about the benefits and risks of accepting a kidney transplant from a donor with two variant copies of APOL1 versus waiting for a transplant from a different donor at a later time. This study will also determine whether otherwise healthy African American patients who have these genes can safely be living kidney donors, or whether the presence of the two APOL gene variants increases their risk of kidney disease so much that they cannot safely donate.",Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium,9768573,U01DK116099,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood donor ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Injury ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' UPK3 gene ', ' uroplakin III ', ' Uroplakin 3A ', ' Uroplakin 3 ', ' UPK3A ', ' UPK3 ', ' UPIIIA ', ' UP3 ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Allografting ', ' Inferior ', ' kidney allograft ', ' renal allograft ', ' hazard ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' longterm followup ', ' long-term followup ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' graft failure ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' data sharing ', ' Regimen ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' imaging study ', ' transplant centers ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' post-transplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,346142,0.1788708586833125
"Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort(CRIC) Study Project Summary/Abstract Despite the dramatic growth of the Hispanic population with end stage renal disease in the U.S., relatively little is known about earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics. The Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is based at the University of Illinois at Chicago and is an ancillary study to the NIDDK-sponsored multi-center CRIC Study. During the first two funding periods, the study assembled a sizable cohort of Hispanics with moderate to severe CKD and addressed critical questions. One key finding was that compared to non-Hispanics whites, Hispanics with CKD are burdened by lower socioeconomic status, poorer blood pressure control, higher depressive symptoms, and lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Furthermore, we found that Hispanics with CKD experienced a twofold higher rate of CKD progression but this disparity was explained by potentially modifiable sociodemographic and clinical factors. This finding has important implications for practice and underscores the need to better understand factors influencing risk factor control and health outcomes in Hispanics. As a result of our findings, the scientific scope of this competitive renewal has been broadened to address knowledge gaps in the following areas: 1) epidemiology of mild CKD, 2) impact of sociocultural/ psychosocial factors on CKD progression and cardiovascular events among Hispanics, and 3) influence of CKD progression on patient-centered outcomes. First, because individuals with mild CKD comprise a much larger proportion of the CKD population, improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors in early disease may have substantial public health implications. Recognizing the need to understand the epidemiology of mild CKD, the parent CRIC Study recently recruited 1500 additional adults with eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2. However, only 4% of these participants are Hispanic. Second, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that sociocultural and psychosocial factors influence health outcomes in Hispanics but these factors have not been studied in the context of CKD. Third, in addition to studying traditional clinical outcomes, there is growing recognition of the need to study outcomes defined by patients as being important. This application seeks to continue follow-up of the existing Hispanic CRIC cohort and enrich it with recruitment of 125 Hispanics with mild CKD (eGFR 45-70 ml/min/1.73m2) to accomplish the following Aims: 1) Evaluate the association of Hispanic ethnicity with risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in adults with mild CKD; 2) Investigate the association of sociocultural and psychosocial factors with CKD progression and cardiovascular events among Hispanics across the spectrum of CKD severity; and 3) Examine the relationship of CKD progression with patient-centered outcomes (e.g., HRQOL, physical function, pain) across the spectrum of CKD severity, among Hispanics and across racial/ethnic groups. The renewal of Hispanic CRIC and its continued close link to the parent CRIC Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to efficiently address a broad range of critical questions regarding the epidemiology of CKD in Hispanics. Project Narrative During the first two funding periods, the Hispanic Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study has provided important insights about the burden of moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Hispanics and its impact on various outcomes. The proposed renewal expands the scientific scope of the study by focusing on mild CKD and conducting a rigorous evaluation of sociocultural/psychosocial factors and patient- centered outcomes which are relevant to the Hispanic CKD population.

"Genetics of kidney disease in diverse populations ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease affects one in 10 people worldwide, and it contributes to premature morbidity and death. The underlying mechanisms for its development and predisposition are unknown, limiting progress in the identification of prognostic biomarkers or the development of treatment interventions. There are known ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease risk, yet little research has been done in diverse (non-European) populations. Studies have identified several ancestral variants (e.g., APOL1, sickle cell) conferring risk of chronic kidney disease in persons of African ancestry including admixed Hispanics/Latinos. To better understand the genetic risk for chronic kidney disease across diverse populations, we recently established the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network Kidney (COGENT-Kidney) Consortium, which includes 71,638 participants from four major ancestral groups (African, Hispanic/Latino, European and East Asian). Using novel trans-ethnic meta-analysis approaches, we identified 20 loci for kidney function and showed important gains in uncovering functional variants within loci using diverse populations. The current proposal seeks to provide important needed information to address the contribution of ancestry-specific variants to the natural history of chronic kidney disease phenotypes in under-studied Hispanics/Latinos (Aim 1), by leveraging the comprehensive longitudinal data in over 12,000 participants of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latino. To identify novel genetic loci and underlying mechanisms that are relevant to all ancestries, we propose to recruit additional studies to the COGENT-Kidney Consortium for an unprecedented trans-ethnic meta-analysis of kidney traits, including a total of over 622,000 participants from diverse populations (East and South Asian, Hispanic/Latino, African and African American, American Indian, and white) (Aim 2). We will prioritize genes to test their functional role in in vitro experiments and mouse models of kidney injury (Aim 3). Our results can provide important insight into genetic contributions to ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease risk and to inform on molecular mechanisms related to chronic kidney disease development. Ultimately, this research could inform personalized medicine and improve the understanding and management of kidney health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will leverage existing genetic, clinical and biomarker data to identify and characterize genetic risk factors for kidney disease in several ethnic populations. Findings from this study may provide important insights into the biological mechanisms for chronic kidney disease development, ethnic disparities in risk and may have implications for precision medicine.",Genetics of kidney disease in diverse populations,9791177,R01DK117445,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Albumins ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Maps ', ' Mission ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Wake Forest APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all US kidney transplants from African American kidney donors to determine their effect on transplant outcomes. In addition, the post- donation health and kidney function of African American living kidney donors will be assessed. We are applying to be the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC) for this NIH Funding Announcement. Shorter renal allograft survival is observed for transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors, relative to deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute to the disparity. These variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease, but rare in other racial/ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients in order to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. This information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation are made and regarding the safety of living kidney donation. Before this genotypic data can be used clinically, a prospective national study is required to evaluate all kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from retrospective studies needs to be collected, including recipient APOL1 genotypes, renal histologic data in failed allografts and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. We will perform the following activities for the APOLLO Network: overall study coordination, assist with preparation of the final protocol and Manual of Procedures, develop data tracking tools and the study website, collect and archive clinical and outcomes data, perform genotyping, statistical analyses, assessment of the primary outcome “time to allograft failure in transplanted kidneys from African American donors, based on donor APOL1 genotypes” and create a bio-repository. We will longitudinally assess vital status, kidney function and proteinuria in living African American kidney donors based on APOL1 genotypes. Prospective assessment of the effects of kidney donor APOL1 genotypes on serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria in transplant recipients with functioning allografts will also be performed. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Genetic information in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) from African American donors of kidneys and transplant recipients may provide more accurate assessments of the likelihood of long-term survival of transplanted kidneys and optimize matching of donors with recipients. This application is submitted in response to the National Institutes of Health request for applications for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Scientific and Data Research Center and proposes to prospectively evaluate effects of donor and recipient APOL1 genotypes in kidney transplants from African American donors performed at all US transplant programs.

"Improving Quality and Access to Early Steps in Kidney Transplantation Abstract Kidney transplantation offers longer survival, better quality of life, reduced hospitalization, and lower cost relative to dialysis for the >500,000 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis in the US. Despite this evidence, only 18.5% of ESRD patients are waitlisted for a kidney transplant. Extensive population research has identified substantial variability in kidney transplant access among US ESRD patients as well as dialysis facilities and transplant centers due to patient-, neighborhood- and health system-level factors, but no national surveillance data exist on early kidney transplant steps. Our overarching, long-term goal is to eliminate inequities and improve healthcare delivery for ESRD patients in every step of the highly complex kidney transplant process. Our specific aims are to: (1) describe dialysis facility and transplant center differences in early steps of the kidney transplantation process, including a) referral for kidney transplant evaluation, b) start of the transplant evaluation process, and c) placement on the national deceased donor waiting list and (2) determine the patient-, neighborhood-, and health center-level barriers that explain disparities in these early steps of kidney transplantation among participating ESRD Networks in the Southeast US, Northeast US, and Ohio River Valley, and determine how barriers vary across geographic region. This study will be conducted in a geographically diverse population of ESRD patients in the Southeast (GA, NC, SC), Northeast (CT, MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VT) and the Ohio River Valley (IN, KY, OH) representing 48 transplant centers, ~1,800 dialysis facilities, and ~155,000 incident ESRD patients. With these novel data, we will conduct critical epidemiologic analyses to describe regional variability in several outcomes, including: a) dialysis facility-level kidney transplant referral rates, b) dialysis facility-level evaluation start rates, and c) transplant center waitlisting rates among those who initiated the evaluation process. In Aim 2, we will identify the barriers to these important transplant steps using multilevel models as well as dialysis facility and transplant center provider surveys and patient focus groups. This work will help to identify the geographic regions and the dialysis facilities with the lowest rates of kidney transplant referral and evaluation and better understand the characteristics of the populations with lowest rates of transplantation access. Findings will be disseminated to the respective ESRD Network leaders in each geographic region as well as to transplant centers and other stakeholders, where they can target regional quality improvement efforts to improve access and reduce disparities in kidney transplantation. Results will also inform future multi-level and multicomponent interventions adapted to fit the needs of each geographic region. Project Narrative There are no national surveillance data to describe early steps in kidney transplantation, despite evidence of substantial variation in access to transplantation across dialysis facilities, transplant centers, and geographic region as well as disparities among minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. The proposed study seeks to collect new data on transplant referral and evaluation start in the Southeast (GA, NC, and SC), Northeast (NY, New England), and Ohio River Valley (OH, IN, KY) and conduct epidemiologic analyses as well as surveys of clinical providers and patient focus groups to identify region-specific barriers and facilitators for access to multiple steps in the kidney transplant process.

"Cleveland Precision Medicine Chronic Kidney Disease Cohort Project Abstract Although hypertension is associated with ~25% of end-stage renal disease (H-ESRD) in the United States, the pathogenic mechanisms that drive the initiation and progression of hypertension-associated chronic kidney disease (HTN-CKD) are unclear. The incidence of H-ESRD is 4- to 5-fold greater in African American populations than in whites. To address this health disparity, the Cleveland KPMP Recruiting Network will recruit a cohort of CKD patients with HTN-CKD. Prospective participants with CKD stage 3a will be identified by automated, scheduled queries of the electronic health records (EHR) of two large health care delivery systems in Cleveland, OH, the Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth. Eligible candidates will be enriched for subjects likely to progress by using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation to identify individuals with > 15% probability of developing ESRD in 5 years. This Network plans enrollment of 10 participants each year during the two year UG3 exploratory phase and 40 to 50 subjects each year for the subsequent, three year UH3 implementation phase. Once kidney research biopsy safety is established in UG3, HTN-CKD subject inclusion criteria in UH3 will be modified to include proteinuric CKD Stage 2 patients. Subjects with other CKD phenotypes can be recruited to support consortium goals. After informed consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a baseline MRI to image kidney structure and a research kidney biopsy and then be followed every 6 months at standard of care visits for the duration of the KPMP. Baseline and longitudinal biosamples will be collected and linked through REDCap to clinical data in the EHRs. The Network plans to obtain additional healthy and disease kidney samples from living donor kidney implant biopsies and an additional tissue core obtained at an indication biopsy from HTN-CKD patients, respectively. Clinical data, biopsy blocks and biosamples will be submitted to Central Hub repositories. The Network includes a Community Partnership Committee composed of CKD patients and families, physicians and an ethicist to guide implementation of this KPMP Network. In anticipation of Opportunity Pool funding, the PIs have recruited co-investigators, who will utilize the rich KPMP molecular, radiologic and histopathologic phenotypes and longitudinal clinical data for discovery. Since excess risk in African Americans for HTN-CKD is largely explained by genetic variations in APOL1, our initial research goal in UH3 is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this association. We will integrate molecular and clinical phenotypes with visual and subvisual morphologic descriptors to discover the cells and associated molecular pathways mediating APOL1-associated HTN-CKD. In pilot, proof- of-principle studies, we used computational methods and identified a set of sub-visual morphologic features that discriminated 10 African American kidney transplant implant biopsies with high risk APOL1 genotypes from 6 implant biopsies with low risk APOL1 genotypes. Creative strategies that integrate KPMP datasets will define other research questions to identify biologic pathways driving CKD and result in new CKD therapies. Project Narrative Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) affect over 20 million Americans, but their causes are poorly understood and CKD often worsens despite treatment. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) will recruit adults from around the United States for a research kidney biopsy and long term follow-up in order to discover causes of CKD and improve outcomes and care of CKD patients. The Cleveland KPMP Recruiting Network will enroll individuals with mild to moderate kidney injury attributed to high blood pressure and collect their kidney tissue; blood, urine and stool samples; and de-identified health information. Working with KPMP scientists, together we will improve diagnosis and treatment of CKD in order to stop or reverse kidney damage, which often results in death or need for dialysis for CKD

"Impact of race, socioeconomic status, and geography on disparities in access to heart transplant Project Summary/Abstract Heart transplant (HT) is the option of last resort for many patients with advanced heart failure (HF). HF affected 5.7 million Americans in 2012. HF is known to be more common in black and Hispanic/Latino persons compared to their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. Extensive past evidence demonstrates racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in healthcare access. In addition, there are well documented disparities in HT outcomes. While literature documenting disparities on the transplant waitlist and post-transplant exists, the path from advanced HF to transplant listing remains a “black box”. This will be investigated through AIM 1: Evaluate the effects of race/ethnicity and SE status on the likelihood of referral for heart transplant evaluation, and how these effects vary geographically. Expected rates of HT listing will be modelled and compared to observed rates of listing stratified by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Additionally, drivers of disparity in HT access are under-studied, especially with regard to patient- and transplant center-level variables that allow some patients a competitive advantage for HT. This will be investigated through AIM 2: Investigate geographic mobility and access to mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as drivers of disparities in access to transplantation. Transplant rates will be modelled with measures of geographic mobility as predictors. Drivers of geographic variation in MCS access and consequences of this variation for transplant access will also be investigated. Finally, in October 2018, the United Network for Organ Sharing allocation scheme was changed to further favor MCS as an indication for HT listing prioritization. The effects of this change on HT disparities will be investigated in AIM 3: Investigate the impact of the 2018 UNOS allocation scheme change on disparities in listing and transplantation with particular focus on the impact of access to MCS. Updated transplant rates including demographics will be obtained and will be evaluated for widening MCS access driven transplant disparities. This project will be conducted at Stanford University, an internationally renowned research institution with a reputation for cultivating young investigators. Additionally, Stanford is one of the most historic and rich environments in the world for HT research. It was the site of the first HT in the United States, remains a world leader in HT, and has esteemed faculty such as Dr. Jeffrey Teuteberg, President of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant. To complement this ideal environment, a training plan was developed focused on developing skills in biostatistics, health disparities and services research, geospatial analysis, and scientific communication, through coursework and frequent meetings with mentors whose expertise perfectly complement these goals. Project Narative This research project will significantly contribute to our understanding of racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in access to heart transplant. Understanding disparities in access will allow identification and in turn intervention upon both system- and provider-level drivers of disparity to ensure fair and effective allocation of this limited resource. Additionally, evaluation of the effects of the 2018 change to the scheme through which donor hearts are allocated will inform the consideration of disparities in future scheme changes.","Impact of race, socioeconomic status, and geography on disparities in access to heart transplant",9833405,F32HL149253,"['Affect ', ' Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty ', ' coronary balloon angioplasty ', ' Transluminal Coronary Balloon Dilatation ', ' Transluminal Balloon Coronary Angioplasty ', ' PTCA ', ' Coronary Artery Balloon Dilatation ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' heart transplant ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' cardiac graft ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Heart-Lung Grafting ', ' Heart-Lung Transplantation ', ' Justice ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Literature ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Resort ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' skills ', ' regional difference ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Scheme ', ' Update ', ' Cardiac ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' organ allocation ', ' data sharing ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' unconscious bias ', ' racial minority ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' transplant centers ', ' post-transplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,63622,0.08865633795179877
"Reducing disparities in living donor transplant among African Americans Abstract For most of the patients in the United States with end stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplantation represents the optimal treatment. Moreover, living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) offers numerous advantages over deceased donor kidney transplant such as better kidney quality, increased short- and long- term graft survival, lower rates of acute rejection, and reduced health care cost. Nevertheless, there are pervasive racial disparities in access to LDKT, with white ESRD patients four times more likely to receive a LDKT than African American ESRD patients. The long-term objective of this program of research is to understand the combined effect of a systems-level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians (Transplant Referral EXchange or T-REX) and a culturally-sensitive individual-level educational intervention (web-based Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing) on racial disparities in access to LDKT. The specific aims of the study are: (a) To develop and refine a web-based version of Living ACTS; (b) To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web-based Living ACTS intervention by comparing the percent of patients with at least one inquiry from a potential living donor among patients who receive Living ACTS compared to those who receive a control website with an embedded educational video; and (c) To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web-based Living ACTS intervention by adapting commonly used process evaluation constructs (context, reach, dose received, fidelity, and recruitment) for an online environment. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among a sample of 800 African American ESRD patients in the southeastern United States (ESRD Network 6 in Georgia and South Carolina), the region of the country with the largest proportion of African American ESRD patients on the waiting list. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions (intervention or control). Participants at all four collaborating transplant centers will be seen by providers who utilize T-REX, thus allowing us to test the independent effect of individual-level education on a systems-level intervention. The primary outcome is the percent of patients with at least one living donor inquiry. Secondary outcomes will test the effect of the intervention on key constructs of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to determine possible mediating pathways. Participants will undergo baseline assessment, access either the intervention or control educational materials, and complete an immediate follow-up assessment. Living donor inquiries will be examined over the subsequent 12 months. The process evaluation will utilize transplant center administrative records, immediate follow-up data from participants, website usage statistics, and study records. It is anticipated that achievement of these aims will yield outcomes with great clinical and public health impact. Narrative There are pervasive racial disparities in access to living donor kidney transplant, which for the majority of end stage renal disease patient represents the optimal treatment. The proposed study seeks to determine whether a systems-level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians coupled with culturally-sensitive individual level education is more effective at increasing access to living donor kidney transplant among African Americans than the systems-level intervention alone. In doing so, this study seeks to have a positive impact on public health and the vision of NIDDK, part of which is to seek insights and answers regarding health disparities in end stage renal disease.",Reducing disparities in living donor transplant among African Americans,9698344,R01DK114891,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Grant ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Motivation ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Friends ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Living Donors ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' stem ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' trial design ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' Wait Time ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' transplant centers ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,239395,0.10368551800856261
"The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD ABSTRACT: Racial inequalities in kidney and end stage renal diseases (ESRD) have been well-documented and are independent of lower socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education), lower access to care, or other conventional risk factors. Research has identified numerous genetic risk factors of renal disease, particularly the APOL1 variants occurring in persons of African descent. However, these genetic factors primarily increase susceptibility, requiring other factors for the development of disease. A growing body of research indicates the importance of neighborhoods for health and health inequalities. Unequal neighborhood contexts may be an important and largely unexplored determinant of the increased kidney disease risk experienced by Blacks compared to Whites. In fact, neighborhood context may interact with genetic susceptibility to result in kidney disease inequalities. Clarifying the role of neighborhood is important as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring. They develop and change through policies and are thus amenable to intervention. Despite the evidence indicating the importance of neighborhoods for the major risk factors and determinants of kidney disease, there is a dearth of empirical research on the role of neighborhoods in relation to kidney disease itself, particularly at pre-ESRD stages. The primary challenges to research in this area are: (a) the lack of skilled researchers with training in both social science and the pathophysiology and genetic science of kidney disease; and (b) the paucity of datasets that contain high quality neighborhood and clinical and genetic measures. To reach my long-term career goal to become a successful, independent researcher who clarifies the social causes and genetic and biomedical mechanisms of racial CKD inequalities, I will address the current scientific challenges through the proposed training and research, respectively by: (a) complementing my early work in the biological sciences and extensive training in the social sciences with extensive training in the pathophysiology and genetics of kidney disease; and (b) creating state-of-the-art neighborhood measures to existing datasets with high quality repeat clinical measures of renal function and damage. I will address three career goals:  1. To obtain formal training in renal physiology and pathophysiology.  2. To develop expertise in genetic epidemiology and population genetics pertaining to racial inequalities in  kidney disease.  3. To take the first step toward independence through an R01 submission. My training will include mentorship and collaboration with leading experts in the genetics and pathophysiology of CKD inequalities, formal coursework in genetic epidemiology, statistical/population genetics, and renal physiology/pathophysiology, and multiple conferences and workshops on the substantive topics of genetics, race, and CKD and on professional development. Through my research project, I will use three cohorts (Health and Retirement Study, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network) to examine the interactive associations between multiple measures of four neighborhood domains (racial residential segregation, social environment, built environment, and health care resources) and genetic risk (APOL1 and β-globin HBB genotypes, adjusting for genetic ancestry), as follows:  Aim 1: Link state-of-the-art measures of four domains of neighborhood context to population-representative,  epidemiological, and clinical cohort datasets containing markers of kidney disease.  Aim 2: Examine longitudinal associations between neighborhood context and renal health, with adjustment  for genetic ancestry and APOL1 genotype.  Aim 3: Examine the modifying role of neighborhood context on longitudinal associations between APOL1  high-risk genotype status and renal health. With this training and dataset creation, I will then clarify the neighborhood characteristics that are most tightly linked to renal outcomes both directly and through their interactions with genetic risk loci. This research will set a solid foundation for research on neighborhood characteristics and inequalities in kidney disease. Not only will this research clarify the interdependent roles of neighborhood and genetic risk on these inequalities, but it will identify key neighborhood characteristics, which are amenable to change, related to kidney disease within and between racial groups. UM is the ideal venue for my training and research as it is internationally recognized as a leading research institution that strongly supports interdisciplinary science. I joined the faculty both at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) because of its commitment to interdisciplinary research, and Nephrology because of its commitment to clarifying the social exposures that contribute to kidney disease. Within ISR, the Nephrology Division, and School of Public Health, I will acquire rigorous training and develop solid collaborations devoted to the clarification of the social and genetic causes of racial inequalities in CKD. NARRATIVE: Racial inequalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been well-documented but are not well-understood. Recent research suggests an important role for genetics such as the high risk variants of the gene, APOL1, encoding the apolipoprotein L1, present only in persons of African descent. However, research also points to neighborhoods as an important source of health inequalities and clarifying its role is critical as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring and are amenable to change. In fact, it may be that neighborhood environments may result in CKD through their interaction with genetic susceptibility. Using three complementary cohorts, I will examine the interactive effects between specific neighborhood characteristics and APOL1 on longitudinal measures of CKD.",The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD,9707786,K01DK106322,"['Apolipoproteins ', ' beta Globin ', ' β-globin ', ' B-globin ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Censuses ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Science of genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Mentorship ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nephrotic Syndrome ', ' Physiology ', ' Privatization ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' African ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' built environment ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' renal damage ', ' kidney damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,152619,0.03983428540338788
"Social Network Analysis and Renal Education to Promote Transplantation (SNARE Transplant) Project Summary Candidate: Although the majority of my training has been clinical, I have developed a unique area of research applying social network theory to examine kidney transplant disparities in hemodialysis patients. My short‐term goals are to obtain the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully complete the proposed research and to conduct theoretically‐grounded, translational research in kidney transplantation. My long‐term career goals are to become an experienced, independent researcher applying social network theory and analytic techniques to improve outcomes for disadvantaged patients with kidney disease. Career Development Plan: My career development plan combines didactic coursework, professional training, and mentored instruction. Specifically, I propose to earn through the College of Public Health and Center for Biomedical Informatics a Master's in Epidemiology and participate in training activities to increase my knowledge of and proficiency in public health, epidemiology, health behavior theory, health communication, social network theory, transplant epidemiology, biomedical ethics, social network analysis, and computing. Research Plan: Women and ethnic minorities are less likely to be informed of the option of transplantation, referred to a transplant center, and complete the medical evaluation needed to be placed on the kidney transplant waiting list. The goal of this research study is to identify and characterize the complete social networks of hemodialysis (HD) patients. We will measure the relative influence of HD social networks on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards transplantation. We will use repeated survey measures as well clinical observations to construct models of these social networks. Finally, we will conduct a transplant education intervention pilot study that tests the diffusion of knowledge and behaviors through the hemodialysis clinic social network. Project Narrative There are significant and persistent disparities in access to kidney transplantation and as a result most patients with end stage renal disease receive hemodialysis (HD). HD is unique as it is a treatment performed in a group setting which lends itself to forming social networks.

"Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium Summary/Abstract Data demonstrate that transplanted kidneys from African American (AA) deceased donors are associated with reduced survival relative to kidneys from non-AA donors. Additional data demonstrate that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants, that are found exclusively in AA individuals, have been associated with an increased risk of CKD/ESRD in the general AA population. Two risk variants of this gene have a prevalence of 13% in AAs, and may account for some or all of the increased risk of transplant loss. There are also anecdotal reports of AA living kidney donors with two APOL1 risk variants developing ESRD raising further concerns. The APOLLO study proposes to enroll all deceased and living AA kidney donors in order to definitively address the impact of APOL1 variants on kidney transplant outcomes. The Emory APOLLO Clinical Centers consortium is comprised of 12 centers distributed across the US but focused in the Southeast. In 2015 these 12 programs transplanted 219 kidneys from deceased and living AA donors accounting for about 9% of all recipients of AA kidneys, the eligible study cohort in the US. The specific aims of our consortium are: (1) to perform APOL1 genotyping on all AA deceased and living kidney donors and create a sample repository for future studies to determine whether additional genetic factors contribute to the second hit postulated to be required for risk manifestation, (2) to compare the survival and function of all transplanted kidneys from AA donors to determine the impact of two APOL1 risk variants on transplant outcomes as well as exploring the potential of environmental factors (rejection, infections, comorbid conditions such as hypertension) to provide the second hit, and 3) to study whether African American living donors who carry two copies of the variant APOL1 genes are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease. Blood samples for APOL1 genotyping of deceased donors will be provided by the organ procurement organization, while the transplant centers will provide blood for genotyping recipients and living donors (as well as deceased donors when necessary). Demographic and clinical donor and recipient data will be provided by UNOS for all subjects. More granular clinical data will be provided for patients receiving their long-term follow up from one the 12 participating transplant centers. We propose enrolling subjects for 1 year and following them for 3 years thereby maximizing the likelihood of observing clinical events. The primary outcome measure for recipients of deceased donor kidneys is graft survival with secondary outcome measures assessing a variety of indicators of renal function and injury. As advance CKD or ESRD following living kidney donation are highly unlikely events, given the relatively short study duration the primary outcome for living kidney donors will be the change in renal function from the post-transplant baseline to the end of follow up at 3 years post-donation. When combined with the data from the other 14 APOLLO Clinical Center Consortia, we believe our data will contribute to a much more complete understanding of the impact of APOL1 gene variants on the outcomes of kidney transplantation and donation. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE STATEMENT: This study will improve the public health by determining if transplanted kidneys from African American donors who have two specific copies of variants of the apolipoprotein L1 gene (called APOL1) fail more rapidly than kidneys donated by African Americans without two variant copies of these genes. Should this study confirm the negative impact of the variant APOL1 genes this information would be very helpful for transplant professionals counseling patients in need of kidney transplantation about the benefits and risks of accepting a kidney transplant from a donor with two variant copies of APOL1 versus waiting for a transplant from a different donor at a later time. This study will also determine whether otherwise healthy African American patients who have these genes can safely be living kidney donors, or whether the presence of the two APOL gene variants increases their risk of kidney disease so much that they cannot safely donate.",Studying APOL1 Following Transplantation (SAF-T): the Emory APOLLO Clinical Center Consortium,9975005,U01DK116099,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood donor ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Service area ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' UP3 ', ' UPIIIA ', ' UPK3 ', ' UPK3A ', ' Uroplakin 3 ', ' Uroplakin 3A ', ' uroplakin III ', ' UPK3 gene ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Allografting ', ' Inferior ', ' renal allograft ', ' kidney allograft ', ' hazard ', ' Structure ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' graft failure ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' data sharing ', ' Regimen ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' imaging study ', ' transplant centers ', ' live kidney donor ', ' living kidney donor ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' post-transplant ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,685176,0.1788708586833125
"Wake Forest APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all US kidney transplants from African American kidney donors to determine their effect on transplant outcomes. In addition, the post- donation health and kidney function of African American living kidney donors will be assessed. We are applying to be the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC) for this NIH Funding Announcement. Shorter renal allograft survival is observed for transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors, relative to deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute to the disparity. These variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease, but rare in other racial/ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients in order to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. This information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation are made and regarding the safety of living kidney donation. Before this genotypic data can be used clinically, a prospective national study is required to evaluate all kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from retrospective studies needs to be collected, including recipient APOL1 genotypes, renal histologic data in failed allografts and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. We will perform the following activities for the APOLLO Network: overall study coordination, assist with preparation of the final protocol and Manual of Procedures, develop data tracking tools and the study website, collect and archive clinical and outcomes data, perform genotyping, statistical analyses, assessment of the primary outcome “time to allograft failure in transplanted kidneys from African American donors, based on donor APOL1 genotypes” and create a bio-repository. We will longitudinally assess vital status, kidney function and proteinuria in living African American kidney donors based on APOL1 genotypes. Prospective assessment of the effects of kidney donor APOL1 genotypes on serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria in transplant recipients with functioning allografts will also be performed. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Genetic information in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) from African American donors of kidneys and transplant recipients may provide more accurate assessments of the likelihood of long-term survival of transplanted kidneys and optimize matching of donors with recipients. This application is submitted in response to the National Institutes of Health request for applications for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Scientific and Data Research Center and proposes to prospectively evaluate effects of donor and recipient APOL1 genotypes in kidney transplants from African American donors performed at all US transplant programs.

"The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD ABSTRACT: Racial inequalities in kidney and end stage renal diseases (ESRD) have been well-documented and are independent of lower socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education), lower access to care, or other conventional risk factors. Research has identified numerous genetic risk factors of renal disease, particularly the APOL1 variants occurring in persons of African descent. However, these genetic factors primarily increase susceptibility, requiring other factors for the development of disease. A growing body of research indicates the importance of neighborhoods for health and health inequalities. Unequal neighborhood contexts may be an important and largely unexplored determinant of the increased kidney disease risk experienced by Blacks compared to Whites. In fact, neighborhood context may interact with genetic susceptibility to result in kidney disease inequalities. Clarifying the role of neighborhood is important as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring. They develop and change through policies and are thus amenable to intervention. Despite the evidence indicating the importance of neighborhoods for the major risk factors and determinants of kidney disease, there is a dearth of empirical research on the role of neighborhoods in relation to kidney disease itself, particularly at pre-ESRD stages. The primary challenges to research in this area are: (a) the lack of skilled researchers with training in both social science and the pathophysiology and genetic science of kidney disease; and (b) the paucity of datasets that contain high quality neighborhood and clinical and genetic measures. To reach my long-term career goal to become a successful, independent researcher who clarifies the social causes and genetic and biomedical mechanisms of racial CKD inequalities, I will address the current scientific challenges through the proposed training and research, respectively by: (a) complementing my early work in the biological sciences and extensive training in the social sciences with extensive training in the pathophysiology and genetics of kidney disease; and (b) creating state-of-the-art neighborhood measures to existing datasets with high quality repeat clinical measures of renal function and damage. I will address three career goals:  1. To obtain formal training in renal physiology and pathophysiology.  2. To develop expertise in genetic epidemiology and population genetics pertaining to racial inequalities in  kidney disease.  3. To take the first step toward independence through an R01 submission. My training will include mentorship and collaboration with leading experts in the genetics and pathophysiology of CKD inequalities, formal coursework in genetic epidemiology, statistical/population genetics, and renal physiology/pathophysiology, and multiple conferences and workshops on the substantive topics of genetics, race, and CKD and on professional development. Through my research project, I will use three cohorts (Health and Retirement Study, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network) to examine the interactive associations between multiple measures of four neighborhood domains (racial residential segregation, social environment, built environment, and health care resources) and genetic risk (APOL1 and β-globin HBB genotypes, adjusting for genetic ancestry), as follows:  Aim 1: Link state-of-the-art measures of four domains of neighborhood context to population-representative,  epidemiological, and clinical cohort datasets containing markers of kidney disease.  Aim 2: Examine longitudinal associations between neighborhood context and renal health, with adjustment  for genetic ancestry and APOL1 genotype.  Aim 3: Examine the modifying role of neighborhood context on longitudinal associations between APOL1  high-risk genotype status and renal health. With this training and dataset creation, I will then clarify the neighborhood characteristics that are most tightly linked to renal outcomes both directly and through their interactions with genetic risk loci. This research will set a solid foundation for research on neighborhood characteristics and inequalities in kidney disease. Not only will this research clarify the interdependent roles of neighborhood and genetic risk on these inequalities, but it will identify key neighborhood characteristics, which are amenable to change, related to kidney disease within and between racial groups. UM is the ideal venue for my training and research as it is internationally recognized as a leading research institution that strongly supports interdisciplinary science. I joined the faculty both at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) because of its commitment to interdisciplinary research, and Nephrology because of its commitment to clarifying the social exposures that contribute to kidney disease. Within ISR, the Nephrology Division, and School of Public Health, I will acquire rigorous training and develop solid collaborations devoted to the clarification of the social and genetic causes of racial inequalities in CKD. NARRATIVE: Racial inequalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been well-documented but are not well-understood. Recent research suggests an important role for genetics such as the high risk variants of the gene, APOL1, encoding the apolipoprotein L1, present only in persons of African descent. However, research also points to neighborhoods as an important source of health inequalities and clarifying its role is critical as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring and are amenable to change. In fact, it may be that neighborhood environments may result in CKD through their interaction with genetic susceptibility. Using three complementary cohorts, I will examine the interactive effects between specific neighborhood characteristics and APOL1 on longitudinal measures of CKD.",The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD,9969367,K01DK106322,"['Apolipoproteins ', ' beta Globin ', ' B-globin ', ' β-globin ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Censuses ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Science of genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Mentorship ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nephrotic Syndrome ', ' Physiology ', ' Privatization ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' African ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' built environment ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' renal damage ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,152614,0.03983428540338788
"A pilot to develop and test an Interactive Computer-adaptive Chronic Kidney Disease education program for hospitalized African American patients (I-C-CKD) PROJECT SUMMARY African Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience disparities in the quality of their medical care, self-care and preparation for end stage renal disease (ESRD). Patient education can help African American patients with advanced CKD decide to engage in self-care to delay progression to ESRD and to learn about ESRD treatment options. Hospitalization represents a “missed opportunity” to provide CKD education and ESRD planning to help patients make informed choices about their care that align with their preferences. Many patients are hospitalized within three months of dialysis initiation. The hospital also captures patients who are not otherwise well-linked to the medical system. In prior work, our team developed and implemented a culturally-tailored, multi-modality patient education intervention for hospitalized African American patients with advanced CKD using a racially concordant in-person educator and literacy-sensitive education materials. Our intervention was feasible and effective. However, using an in-person patient educator is resource-intensive. In this proposal, we will develop an interactive, computer adaptive patient education intervention that benefits from the convenience of electronic media with the patient-centered benefits of an in-person educator. We will also determine the efficacy of the computer-adaptive education in improving knowledge for hospitalized African American patients with advanced chronic CKD as compared to usual care. We have assembled a strong team with skills in chronic kidney disease health disparities, hospital-based interventions, culturally-tailored patient- education, motivational interviewing, and technology-based interventions for patient education. This R21 pilot and feasibility trial will enable the team to build and test the efficacy and acceptability of the computer-adaptive education intervention prior to a larger scale randomized R01-level study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient education can help African-Americans with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) make informed decisions about their healthcare; such decisions impact self-care behaviors, which can subsequently delay progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD), and also determine how and when patients choose ESRD treatments. This proposal seeks to develop and evaluate a novel computer-adaptive patient-centered referral and education program for hospitalized African-American patients with advanced CKD. The data from this study will be critical for the development of future R01 proposals to assess the cost-effectiveness and impact on clinical and public health outcomes of this approach to education and referral for patients with advanced CKD and ESRD.",A pilot to develop and test an Interactive Computer-adaptive Chronic Kidney Disease education program for hospitalized African American patients (I-C-CKD),9979312,R21DK121262,"['Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Sodium-Restricted Diet ', ' Low-Salt Diet ', ' Low-Sodium Diet ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fistula ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Home Hemodialysis ', ' Home Hemodialyses ', ' Home Renal Dialysis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Inpatients ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' literacy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Peritoneal Dialysis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Glean ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Link ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' education planning ', ' referral center ', ' biomedical referral center ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' kidney disease education ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' feasibility trial ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2020,207545,0.06102702100475774
"Access to Kidney Transplantation in Minority Populations (AKT-MP) Project Summary/Abstract Kidney transplantation (KT) is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It reduces mortality, improves quality of life, and costs less than dialysis. Previous research demonstrated significant disparities in ESKD and its treatment for members of disadvantaged groups [e.g., Hispanic/Latino (HL), American Indians (AI), low income]. Although HL and AI are referred for KT equally with non-Hispanic whites (WH), they are less likely to be wait-listed or to undergo KT than WH. These findings speak to the importance of research focusing on disparities in the evaluation process occurring after referral for KT, rather than on the referral itself. The KT evaluation process is lengthy, time consuming, and burdensome, requiring patients to complete numerous tests to be presented to the transplant team and accepted for KT. Patients must complete testing on their own, which requires them to take charge of a complex series of tests and follow-up visits with specialist providers. Most efforts to reduce disparities in KT emphasize educating or changing the behavior of patients on dialysis who have not been referred for KT. But these approaches do not reduce the burden of the evaluation process on the patient. Further, educating patients does not eliminate external barriers that may prevent patients from completing KT evaluation despite their best intentions to do so. Instead, altering the way care is delivered to patients, by changing the demands of the KT evaluation process on the patient, will significantly reduce KT disparities. The proposed study will assess whether Kidney Transplant Fast Track (KTFT), a streamlined KT evaluation process, or peer navigators (PN) who were former KT patients to help patients “navigate” their way through KT evaluation, can help vulnerable patients with ESKD overcome barriers to transplant listing. After culturally and contextually adapting the two interventions, we will use a comparative effectiveness (CER) approach to conduct a pragmatic randomized trial of 398 ESKD patients to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of the two approaches in disadvantaged groups at a university-affiliated transplant center with large HL and AI ESKD patient populations, and we will compare results to historic comparison populations (local and national). We will assess facilitators and barriers to widespread implementation and conduct a cost effectiveness analysis. Although it is expected that KTFT will be more effective than PN, KTFT may also be more costly, requiring significant administrative and clinical changes in the transplant center, which may be impractical to maintain. Further, KTFT may lead to more patient ambivalence because the shortened evaluation period will give them less time to consider their treatment options. Thus, an important aspect of the proposed study is to comparative the effectiveness of the two methods. Ultimately, our study will inform transplant programs faced with disparities in KT about which disparity-reducing intervention to use given their particular needs and resources. Project Narrative Hispanic/Latino (HL) and American Indian (AI) patients are more likely than whites to have end stage kidney disease (ESKD), but less likely to complete transplant evaluation or receive a kidney transplant (KT), the best treatment for ESKD. Using comparative effectiveness research methods, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial to compare the efficacy and cost- effectiveness of two approaches to help HL and AI patients overcome barriers to completing transplant evaluation and receiving a KT: a streamlined KT evaluation process and a peer-assisted evaluation program; and, we will determine best practices to assist other transplant centers in implementing the better program.

"Metabolomics and Genomics in African Americans with CKD ?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Two recent discoveries suggest that common, African-specific genetic risk factors are particularly relevant in CKD susceptibility. Variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) and the presence of a single copy of the sickle cell mutation (sickle cell trait, or SCT) both increase the risk of CKD progression. How these variants confer kidney risk, whether there is gene-gene interplay, and the identity of any causal intermediates is unknown. The proposed studies will use two complementary cohorts of African Americans with CKD, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) and a subset of BioMe, to investigate these questions. The AASK study is arguably the most comprehensively phenotyped of African Americans with CKD in the world, assessing participants' kidney function every 6 months for up to 12 years (and up to 17 years for end-stage renal disease and death). BioMe is an ongoing, contemporary cohort of patients receiving medical care in New York City, with substantial resources devoted to biospecimen collection and genotyping. The analysis will build upon our prior work in genetic risk factors for CKD by investigating novel variants and their relationship to kidney function decline as well as gene-gene interplay in risk for adverse CKD outcomes. In addition, we will study the relationship of metabolomic patterns - a snapshot of the end-product of cellular processes - with CKD outcomes. This analysis can lead to identification of novel and potentially modifiable risk factors for CKD outcomes. When combined with genomic data, the metabolomic consequences of genetic risk variants such as the APOL1 high-risk genotype or SCT can be studied. In addition, analytic techniques can help distinguish whether metabolomic risk factors cause adverse CKD outcomes or are simply a byproduct of an associated process. Understanding the relationship between genomics, metabolomics, and outcomes will advance knowledge regarding pathogenic pathways and potentially modifiable targets in CKD progression, particularly in African Americans, an ethnic group disproportionately affected with advanced CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects African Americans. Recent studies have identified two African-specific genetic variants which may explain much of the ethnic differences in CKD risk. Understanding gene function, and in particular the metabolomic intermediates which may be targeted by interventions, can provide critical information that will lead to reductions in CKD incidence and

"Kidney Tubular Injury and Dysfunction and Racial Disparities in Incident Hypertension and Kidney Function Decline PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this competitive revision application is to extend the mission of the University of Alabama at Birmingham-University of California, San Diego O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Research (P30) by examining factors that contribute to racial disparities in kidney-related health outcomes, which are disproportionately represented in the Southeastern US. Black Americans are at higher risk for hypertension (HTN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) than white Americans. The public health implications of these disparities are enormous. It is estimated that over half of the elevated risk of heart disease, stroke and death in black Americans compared with white Americans is attributable to their higher lifetime prevalence of HTN and CKD. This places prevention of HTN and CKD among the most important public health priorities for addressing racial disparities in cardiovascular disease and mortality. However, efforts to develop effective strategies are hampered by a limited understanding of why black Americans experience higher rates of HTN and CKD. This is particularly important at younger ages because HTN and CKD manifest earlier in black Americans. Kidney tubules play a central role in the regulation of blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis disrupt numerous biologic processes related to blood pressure control and glomerular filtration, contributing to the onset of HTN and GFR decline. Our group and others have shown that serum and urine measures of tubule health associate with the development of HTN and CKD progression in select populations. Further, in older age groups, we have preliminary data that suggest black adults have greater tubular injury and dysfunction than white adults as measured by serum and urine markers. However, these prior studies were limited by focusing on older populations or those with established co-morbidities, making it unclear how tubular injury may develop in younger, healthier adults, and whether early damage to the kidney tubules contributes to the disproportionate development of HTN and CKD in black as compared to white adults. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study provides an ideal opportunity to examine associations of markers of kidney tubule health with the development of HTN and CKD in younger adults, and recruited participants in the Southeast US, among other areas. The goals of this application are to (1) determine racial differences in biomarkers of kidney tubule injury and dysfunction and to identify whether unique patterns of kidney damage are more common in black than in white adults; (2) examine the association of novel markers of kidney tubule health with risk of incident HTN and rapid eGFR decline; and (3) quantify the contribution of abnormalities in kidney tubule health to the observed racial disparities in HTN and CKD among CARDIA participants. This competitive revision application will substantially add to the ongoing work of our center by identifying novel factors associated with racial disparities in the burden of HTN and CKD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The premature development of hypertension and kidney disease in black Americans explains a substantial proportion of racial disparities in the heart disease, stroke and death. This application will extend the mission of the UAB-UCSD O'Brien Center for AKI research by addressing major gaps in our understanding of how kidney tubule health may contribute to the development of HTN and kidney function decline in younger adults.",Kidney Tubular Injury and Dysfunction and Racial Disparities in Incident Hypertension and Kidney Function Decline,10164036,P30DK079337,"['Adult ', '

"The Role of Dietary Nutrients in Chronic Kidney Disease Progression and Apolipoprotein L1 Nephropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) individuals Among malignant Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). Approximately 13% of African Americans and 25% of West Africans carry high risk renal genotypes, comprising of any combination of the two APOL1 risk variants, G1 and G2.  This re-submission for a National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) seeks to support Dr. Titilayo Ilori, an Assistant Professor at the Boston University School of Medicine, who wants to build a career focused on mechanistic and interventional studies on the effect of dietary factors and lifestyle on CKD incidence and progression in both low- and adequately-resourced settings, especially in the context of genetic and genomic risk variants. Dr. Ilori's prior research has focused on health disparities in CKD and secondary data analysis of nutrition-related exposures and outcomes in kidney disease. Dr. Ilori intends to extend the scope of her research towards designing prospective studies to study the role of dietary sodium and potassium in CKD progression and APOL1 Nephropathy in Africans. Accordingly, her K23 training is focused on acquiring skills in global health research, nutritional and genetic epidemiology in CKD, statistical genetics and advanced biostatistics skills in longitudinal data analysis, and biomarkers of CKD.  We propose a research project that leverages the Human Hereditary and Health in Africa Kidney Disease Research Network and addresses the following research aims: 1) a cross-sectional and prospective examination of the associations of dietary sodium, potassium, and oxalate intake – assessed through 24h urine collections in Africans; 2) a cross-sectional and prospective study to determine the associations of dietary patterns with CKD and CKD progression; 3) diet:gene interaction studies to examine whether dietary factors (sodium, potassium, oxalate, or dietary patterns) modify the effect of association of APOL1 renal genotypes on CKD progression. This is an important project because it may identify if dietary factors are modifiable risk factors for CKD progressions in Africans in SSA, where the cost of dialysis and renal transplantation is prohibitive. Additionally, evidence that diet alters the risk of nephropathy in those with high-risk APOL1 renal risk alleles could be important in investigating new therapeutic targets for APOL1 Nephropathy. is effectively a “death sentence” in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where <2% of with end stage renal disease (ESRD) have access to maintenance dialysis or transplantation. Africans with CKD, there is a faster decline in kidney function and earlier onset of ESRD. This CKD phenotype is largely attributable to variants in the gene encoding Narrative The aggressive form of kidney disease seen in blacks has been related to genetic risk variants prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa thought to be triggered by other genes and environmental factors.

"Supportive Care in Kidney Disease: Scope of Practice and Pilot Study of Implementation Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a national health epidemic impacting 30 million Americans, with a disproportionate representation in racial and ethnic minority populations. In its most advanced forms, CKD is associated with poor quality of life, overwhelming symptom burden, and a high mortality. Palliative, or supportive care, is a specialty that has expertise in symptom management, assistance in medical decision- making, and end-of-life care. In kidney disease, supportive care often is not integrated in the standard of care, partly due to lack of evidence and failure to identify an optimal model for its delivery. This proposal, “Supportive care in CKD: Scope of practice and pilot implementation” seeks to learn more about the integration of supportive care in current nephrology practice and test the effectiveness of implementing an integrated care model in advanced CKD, while I learn essential training skills to become an independent researcher. Specifically, this is a three-aim study for a mentored career development award that 1) Describes the current scope of integration of supportive care in the care of non-dialysis CKD patients and its association with patient reported outcomes through analysis of a nationally representative database; 2) Tests the effectiveness of integrating supportive care with usual nephrology care in CKD stage IV or V patients using a pilot randomized, controlled trial conducted in an urban safety net hospital; and 3) Determines the mechanism of effectiveness or unmet needs of the supportive care intervention through application of qualitative and mixed-methods methodology. These three aims will be achieved while completing complementary training aims in comparative effectiveness research with specific training in quantitative data base analysis, clinical trial execution, qualitative, and mixed methods methodology. The results of this proposal will provide essential information to the nephrology community about dissemination of supportive care in the care of non-dialysis CKD care, a population with urgent supportive care needs. Furthermore, this analysis will identify disparities in supportive care access in CKD and critical associations between lack of supportive care access and patient reported outcomes. The second phase of this study will move the field of nephrology forward by testing the effectiveness of implementation of supportive care in advanced CKD in a multi-ethnic population representative of the demographics of CKD. The data obtained from these three aims will provide essential data regarding supportive care resources in the community, the potential impact of increasing access to kidney supportive care, the feasibility of implementing new models of supportive care in this population, and the statistical information necessary for the design of larger multi- centered trials. These aims will be accomplished while developing my skills as an independent researcher and positioning me to apply these results in definitive trials with the potential to broadly improve the care of the many Americans suffering from CKD. Project Narrative: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) live with many supportive care needs, yet the supportive care specialty remains poorly integrated into CKD care. This project describes the current state of dissemination of supportive care in pre-dialysis CKD care, its association with patient centered outcomes, and tests the effectiveness of integrating supportive care into CKD care. The information obtained from this study will provide important knowledge of approaches to care that have the potential to improve quality of life, outcomes, and satisfaction with care for CKD patients.",Supportive Care in Kidney Disease: Scope of Practice and Pilot Study of Implementation,10040571,K23DK125840,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' satisfaction ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' skills training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Chronic Care ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' standard of care ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' improved outcome ', ' treatment choice ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' minority communities ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' clinical trial analysis ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2020,193512,0.15783992953733478
"Mentored patient-oriented research in disparities in cardiovascular and kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Gutiérrez is an Associate Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, Section Head of Outcomes and Epidemiology research in the Division of Nephrology, and Medical Director of the Bionutrition Unit in the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The long- term scientific goal of Dr. Gutiérrez is to build a patient-oriented research (POR) program focused on identifying novel strategies for reducing or eliminating disparities in health outcomes related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In order to accomplish this goal, Dr. Gutiérrez recognizes the critical importance of mentoring the next generation of clinician scientists who can develop the necessary expertise to investigate root causes of disparities in a comprehensive and ethical manner. However, the increasing demands on his time related to sustaining his professional effort for research as well as administrative and supervisory commitments pose a challenge towards his ability to grow his mentorship activities. This award will ensure Dr. Gutiérrez maintains the protected time to focus on POR related to disparities in CVD and CKD, a central component of which will involve mentoring junior investigators. His trainees will receive comprehensive training in POR centered on three main projects which focus on (1) the role of disordered mineral metabolism, (2) nutrition, (3) and novel pathways of kidney injury in explaining racial differences in CVD and CKD outcomes. This activities will be coupled with a robust program to enhance his skills as a mentor, with the ultimate goal of producing well-trained investigators committed to POR focused on disparities in health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Disparities in cardiovascular and kidney disease are among the biggest drivers of excess mortality in racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, costing billions of dollars a year. There is a need for investigators who have the appropriate training in patient-oriented research to identify reasons for disparities in cardiovascular and kidney disease and devise ways to overcome them.

"Diet and Hypertension Management in Chronic Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract: Excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among Black Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant US public health disparity. Compared to their White counterparts, Blacks with CKD develop kidney disease earlier in life, are 3 times more likely to develop kidney failure necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation, and are 1.5 times more likely to die prematurely from CVD. Hypertension, which is also more prevalent, more severe, and less often controlled in Blacks with CKD compared to Whites, is a leading cause of CKD and CVD, and a major contributor to the racial disparity in CVD mortality. Therefore, improving hypertension in Blacks with CKD could have a profound positive impact on an important minority health issue. The long-term career goal of Dr. Crystal Tyson, who is a nephrologist and hypertension specialist, is to develop sustainable interventions that improve hypertension and eliminate racial disparities in CVD among adults with CKD. In her formative work, Dr. Tyson conducted a pilot metabolic feeding study which demonstrated that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH) lowers BP in Black adults with CKD without having adverse effects on metabolic markers of safety. In this application, Dr. Tyson will move her research forward by modifying an existing DASH counseling intervention that was previously demonstrated by her mentors (Svetkey, Lin) to improve DASH adherence and BP in racially diverse, non-CKD populations, to now specifically address cultural and disease-specific considerations of Blacks with CKD. For Aim 1, she will conduct formative qualitative research involving focus group discussions with Black adults with hypertension and CKD to identify barriers and facilitators of DASH adherence. For Aim 2, she will conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to test feasibility, acceptability, and the preliminary effect on DASH adherence and BP of the newly-modified intervention in 50 Black patients with hypertension and CKD. During the award period, Dr. Tyson will train to develop (1) new skills in qualitative research methods, (2) new skills to conduct behavioral and diet interventions in minority and CKD populations, and (3) enhanced skills in health disparities and minority health research methods. Her highly-accomplished, multi-disciplinary mentorship team will be led by Laura Svetkey, MD, MHS, an internationally recognized hypertension and clinical trial expert who has received several institutional awards for her leadership in faculty diversity and mentoring. Dr. Tyson’s team will also include national leaders in CKD-related health disparities (L. Ebony Boulware, MD, MPH), behavioral intervention and dissemination research (Gary Bennett, PhD, MPH), qualitative research methods (Laura Fish, PhD), and biostatistics (Jane Pendergast, PhD). By accomplishing the research aims and training objectives of this career development award, Dr. Tyson will be prepared to successfully transition to research independence and develop broadly implementable interventions that help eliminate racial disparities in CVD among CKD populations. Project Narrative High blood pressure (BP) control rates are low among Black Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which causes Blacks with CKD to die prematurely from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of the proposed study is to develop a behavioral diet counseling intervention that is specifically designed to lower BP in Black adults with CKD. This research has the potential to address an important public health need for therapies that are proven to improve BP control rates and reduce CVD death rates among Blacks with CKD.",Diet and

"Sex Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplant is regarded as the best treatment modality for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite the known benefits of kidney transplantation over dialysis, inequities in access to transplantation are present by sex. In both adults and children, female sex is associated with a lower likelihood of receiving a kidney transplant compared to male sex. The reasons for these disparities in access to transplant among women versus men are unclear. Because of the unique characteristics of populations with different underlying cause of ESRD, it is possible that sex-based disparities in access to transplant differ among the different underlying attributed causes of ESRD. Characteristics specific to different causes of ESRD (such as the propensity for a disease to progress more rapidly in one sex and therefore preclude completion of the transplant evaluation process prior to dialysis) may lead to differences in the magnitude of the inequities in access to transplant among men versus women. In addition, prior literature has also shown that women are less likely to receive a living donor transplant (especially from spouses), even though women are more likely to donate a kidney. The decision not to donate a kidney despite eligibility for donation may be associated with a potential donors’ subjective perceptions regarding their own health and donor candidacy. We hypothesize that these health perceptions may differ among male versus female donors, contribute to lower donation rates by men, which in turn, lead to a smaller pool of potential donors that lowers access to kidney transplantation among women. The Kidney Failure Risk Projection (KFRP) equation has recently been established to provide objective estimates of the 15-year risk for the development of ESRD among potential donors. In this study, we will determine whether there are differences in male versus female donors’ perception of self-health, and we will compare these self-perceptions with the objective measure of the risk of ESRD using the KFRP equation. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) determine whether differences in access to transplantation by sex are modified by underlying cause of ESRD and 2) understand perceived versus actual medical barriers to living kidney donation according to donor sex. The expected outcome of this proposal is that we will enhance our understanding of whether subpopulations of patients with various underlying causes of renal disease may benefit from specific interventions to equalize parity in transplant. We also seek to understand which factors may be modifiable in the living donor evaluation process to improve living donor transplantation rates and access of women to living donor transplants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women and girls with end-stage renal disease are significantly less likely than men and boys to undergo a kidney transplant. Reasons for this disparity have not yet been fully elucidated. Disparities in access to kidney transplant may be related to the underlying cause of end-stage renal disease and sex-based differences in access to living donors. The long-term goals of this proposal are to further our understanding of disparities in kidney transplant access and identify areas where improvements can be made to provide parity in access to kidney transplant for all patients.",Sex Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplant,10076364,F32DK118869,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Dropout ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Nephrology ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' parity ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urinary tract ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' Self Perception ', ' Funding ', ' Living Donors ', ' programs ', ' Equation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Data ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' Outcome ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' Wait Time ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,75858,0.1462900035016134
"Improving Quality and Access to Early Steps in Kidney Transplantation Abstract Kidney transplantation offers longer survival, better quality of life, reduced hospitalization, and lower cost relative to dialysis for the >500,000 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis in the US. Despite this evidence, only 18.5% of ESRD patients are waitlisted for a kidney transplant. Extensive population research has identified substantial variability in kidney transplant access among US ESRD patients as well as dialysis facilities and transplant centers due to patient-, neighborhood- and health system-level factors, but no national surveillance data exist on early kidney transplant steps. Our overarching, long-term goal is to eliminate inequities and improve healthcare delivery for ESRD patients in every step of the highly complex kidney transplant process. Our specific aims are to: (1) describe dialysis facility and transplant center differences in early steps of the kidney transplantation process, including a) referral for kidney transplant evaluation, b) start of the transplant evaluation process, and c) placement on the national deceased donor waiting list and (2) determine the patient-, neighborhood-, and health center-level barriers that explain disparities in these early steps of kidney transplantation among participating ESRD Networks in the Southeast US, Northeast US, and Ohio River Valley, and determine how barriers vary across geographic region. This study will be conducted in a geographically diverse population of ESRD patients in the Southeast (GA, NC, SC), Northeast (CT, MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VT) and the Ohio River Valley (IN, KY, OH) representing 48 transplant centers, ~1,800 dialysis facilities, and ~155,000 incident ESRD patients. With these novel data, we will conduct critical epidemiologic analyses to describe regional variability in several outcomes, including: a) dialysis facility-level kidney transplant referral rates, b) dialysis facility-level evaluation start rates, and c) transplant center waitlisting rates among those who initiated the evaluation process. In Aim 2, we will identify the barriers to these important transplant steps using multilevel models as well as dialysis facility and transplant center provider surveys and patient focus groups. This work will help to identify the geographic regions and the dialysis facilities with the lowest rates of kidney transplant referral and evaluation and better understand the characteristics of the populations with lowest rates of transplantation access. Findings will be disseminated to the respective ESRD Network leaders in each geographic region as well as to transplant centers and other stakeholders, where they can target regional quality improvement efforts to improve access and reduce disparities in kidney transplantation. Results will also inform future multi-level and multicomponent interventions adapted to fit the needs of each geographic region.

"Reaching Equity for Adults and CHildren in Transplant (REACH-TRANSPLANT) PROJECT ABSTRACT For over two decades, blacks and Hispanics have been less likely to receive kidney transplantation than non- Hispanic whites (NHWs), especially from a living donor (LD). Many studies have focused on recipient-related barriers that may contribute to these disparities, but less attention has been paid to how these disparities may arise during recipient and LD evaluation, LD selection, and LD follow-up. For instance, our current system for the evaluation of transplant candidacy recommends referral to transplant centers when the recipient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is < 30mL/min/1.73 m2, and allows for waitlist registration when the eGFR is <20mL/min/1.73 m2. However, kidney disease is known to progress more rapidly among blacks and Hispanics (vs. NHWs), so donors to a black or Hispanic (vs. NHW) recipient may have less time to complete their workup before the need for dialysis arises in the recipient. Black donors have also been noted to have higher risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to white donors after donation. Heightened awareness of the higher ESRD risk among prior black LDs may predispose to reduced acceptance of even healthy black living donor candidates (the majority of whom donate to black recipients), thereby diminishing the pool of LDs. Finally, lack of consistent medical follow-up of prior LDs may reduce opportunities for early prevention and intervention to reduce risk factors for the development of CKD, especially among black or Hispanic LDs. Sparse data are available regarding whether post-donation health monitoring differs by race/ethnicity, and whether risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) could be more optimally managed to mitigate the higher risk of ESRD among prior black/Hispanic LDs. If outcomes among black or Hispanic donors could be improved, access of black and Hispanic recipients to LDs could also improve. In this proposal, our goal is to examine whether 1) use of a risk-based threshold (vs. an absolute eGFR threshold) to guide when we refer patients for transplant candidacy (and donor) evaluation may improve inequities in the time available for transplant preparation by race/ethnicity (Aim 1); 2) differential acceptance of black or Hispanic (vs. NHW) donor candidates overall, and by provider or transplant center, are occurring despite the availability of objective metrics of donor ESRD risk (Aim 2); 3) post-donation health monitoring and risk factor modification is inadequate among black and Hispanic (vs. NHW) LDs (Aim 3). To accomplish our aims, we will use electronic health record data collected prospectively and retrospectively from transplant centers across the US (Aims 1-2) and prospectively recruit LDs for Aim 3. Data from this proposal will inform the design of multi- level interventions to improve disparities in transplant outcomes, including 1) better acknowledgement of variations in the rate of CKD progression when planning the timing of transplant referral; 2) increased use of objective metrics of ESRD risk during donor evaluation; and 3) enhanced compliance with post-donation health monitoring with the goal of providing early risk factor modification to improve donor outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the long-standing observed racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation and donor outcomes. We propose to identify whether lower access of blacks and Hispanics to transplantation, especially from a living donor, may be related to system- level barriers within our donor evaluation, selection, and follow-up process, and heightened concerns for adverse outcomes among black and Hispanic living donors.",Reaching Equity for Adults and CHildren in Transplant (REACH-TRANSPLANT),10016295,R01DK120886,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' parity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' tool ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Impaired health ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', "" National Children's Study "", ' high risk ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' screening ', ' recruit ', ' system-level barriers ', ' Wait Time ', ' transplant centers ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,702325,0.16300947532583893
"Differential survival selections and care-related determinants among African Americans and Hispanics versus whites with chronic kidney disease Project Summary This proposal represents our continuing efforts to contribute to NIDDK's Strategic Plan to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end-stage renal disease (ESRD; stage 5 CKD). Despite extensive research over the last two decades, critical knowledge gaps persist. First, African Americans (AAs) and Hispanics continue to have 2-3 times higher incidence of ESRD than non-Hispanic whites (whites), but paradoxically have much better survival than whites after reaching ESRD and undergoing dialysis. Speculation is that this apparent survival advantage is related to survival disadvantage and inadequate care for AAs and Hispanics during the pre-ESRD period, but confirming this has been hampered by methodological challenges. Second, we still do not understand how differences in mortality between minorities and whites evolve over time as the disease advances. And third, we do not fully grasp how processes of care, which are potentially modifiable and vital to improving outcomes, affect survival selections among minorities (vs. whites).  To close these longstanding knowledge gaps, we propose to conduct the first event-history analysis of national incident CKD populations to examine in-depth racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes and processes of care over the full course of CKD. Our central hypothesis is that differences in mortality between minorities (AAs and Hispanics) and whites are time-dependent over the course of CKD, and that differences in ESRD are related to the differences in pre-ESRD, which result from differential survival-selection processes between the groups. The analyses proposed under our three Specific Aims will test this and other specific hypotheses and examine a range of factors for the differential survival selections, particularly the processes of care. Aim 1 will yield a detailed characterization of how racial/ethnic differences in mortality evolve over the full course of CKD. Aim 2 will examine the effect of processes of care on differential survival selections among racial/ethnic groups, which drives the time-dependent changes found in Aim 1. Aim 3 will assess the role of unexplained risks in these differential survival-selection processes. In addition to our novel hypotheses and innovative analytic approaches, this study will foster methodological advances in CKD research, which include the use of 1) two national incident CKD cohorts with >15 years of follow-up that connect the pre-ESRD and ESRD periods—the national veteran CKD population (>1.3 million) for primary analyses, and the Medicare CKD population (>790,000) for further understanding of processes of care across the nation; and 2) advanced statistical techniques, including time-dependent multi-state survival models and frailty models. This study will offer novel understanding of why differential survival rates among AAs and Hispanics vs. whites exist and how they can be addressed. Our results for real-world processes of care among AAs and Hispanics can be directly translated into actionable initiatives to enhance care for minority CKD patients. Building on our team's outstanding record, we anticipate that our efforts will continue to be novel, productive and highly impactful. . Project Narrative Racial/ethnic disparities have persisted in multiple aspects of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end- stage renal disease (ESRD), from processes and quality of care to incidence of ESRD and outcomes. We will perform event-history analyses of large incident CKD cohorts to critically examine the causes of the racial/ethnic disparities along the entire spectrum from pre-ESRD to ESRD. Understanding the sources of these disparities will serve to minimize them and improve the care of minority patients with CKD/ESRD.",Differential survival selections and care-related determinants among African Americans and Hispanics versus whites with chronic kidney disease,9830058,R01DK112008,"['Affect ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Incidence ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Fostering ', ' Event History Analyses ', ' Event History Analysis ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' data structure ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' improved outcome ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' structured data ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,351112,0.06635156912009489
"Intracellular functions of APOL1 in the kidney ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in African Americans is one of the largest racial health disparities in the United States. The cause for the increased risk has been attributed to recessive inheritance of allelic variants in the gene for apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). These APOL1 variants, known as G1 and G2, do not cause CKD on their own, but CKD is caused by a combination of the inherited genetic risk plus exposure to a triggering environmental stressor. The biological function of APOL1 in the kidney and the mechanism of pathogenesis in the setting of a disease stressor remain unclear. Our recent studies have demonstrated, for the first time, a function for the common APOL1 allele, known as G0, in providing protection against podocyte losses and glomerulosclerosis in one of the CKDs highly associated with carriage of APOL1 risk alleles (HIV-associated nephropathy). The fundamental cause of this protection appears to be linked to a role of APOL1 G0 in supporting innate immune signaling events through pattern recognition receptors. In addition, since APOL1 risk is a recessively inherited trait, this also suggests CKD may be cause, in part, by a loss of this beneficial function. To advance these studies, we propose to develop additional cell-based and animal-based model systems to investigate the function of APOL1 G0 in innate immune responses, and how these responses are altered in the presence of the risk variants G1 and G2. These new cell and animal based systems will allow for both biochemical studies to address mechanism of action and physiological studies to assess impact on CKD progression, and should provide insight into gain- versus loss-of-function mechanisms associated with the recessive inheritance of APOL1 risk alleles. Determining the contribution of G0 function versus risk variant dysfunction will have important clinical impact on further therapy design, as it will establish whether replacement of G0 or suppression of the risk variants would be the more effective strategy. NARRATIVE Kidney disease is more common in African Americans and is linked to genetic variants in the gene APOL1. Since this gene is expressed in the kidney, understanding the function of this protein in both normal and disease responses is needed. We hope to determine the normal function of APOL1 and how this is different with the disease variants to allow the development of strategies or identification of novel targets for new therapies for kidney diseases impacted by APOL1 genotype.",Intracellular functions of APOL1 in the kidney,10252083,R56DK127638,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Animals ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Award ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Recombinant DNA ', ' Recombinant DNA Molecular Biology ', ' rDNA ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Plasmids ', ' Poly I-C ', ' Polyinosinic-Polycytidylic Acid ', ' poly IC ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' glomerular sclerosis ', ' glomerulosclerosis ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' environmental stressor ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' response ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' BAC clone ', ' BACs ', ' Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes ', ' disease stressor ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' podocyte ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Pattern recognition receptor ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' loss of function ', ' gain of function ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' nanostring ', ' nano-string ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' Innate Immune Response ', ' Immune signaling ', ' ']",NIDDK,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R56,2020,104650,0.12428475001931938
"A Mixed Method to Identify Causes of Kidney Cancer Surgical Disparities in Arizona PROJECT SUMMARY  American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs) and U.S.-born Hispanic Americans (HAs) have a heavier burden of kidney cancer than non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). They often have multiple barriers to health care, and they are often diagnosed with more advanced stage kidney cancer. Early detection and timely surgical treatment with a minimally invasive surgical method likely reduce kidney cancer health disparities. However, kidney cancer health disparities research focuses on differences in clinical characteristics between NHWs and non-Hispanic Blacks often using national-level data ignoring heterogeneity across U.S. regions or subpopulations. AIs/ANs and HAs are underrepresented in kidney cancer clinical studies, and risk factors for diagnosis with advanced stage kidney cancer and mortality among these racial/ethnic groups are not well understood. Moreover, there is no qualitative study in AIs/ANs and HAs to identify factors that affect surgical treatment that AI/AN and HA patients receive and if they are contributing to high mortality.  The goal of this study is to identify causes of kidney cancer surgical disparities using a mixed method approach combining semi-structured in-depth interviews and analysis of clinical data at local-, state-, and national-levels using data from Banner University Medical Center, Arizona Cancer Registry, and the National Cancer Database. We hypothesize that compared to NHWs, AIs and HAs have poor understanding of cancer and kidney cancer symptoms and experience more barriers in health care which results in advanced stage cancer diagnosis, delay of care, delivery of less optimal treatments, and ultimately poorer survival. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used respectively in Specific Aims (SA) 1 and 2 to explore how differently that AIs and HAs or HA subgroups experience the kidney cancer surgical disparities. To identify knowledge gaps in kidney cancer secondary and tertiary prevention and barriers to care, one-hour semi-structured in- depth interviews will be conducted to assess understanding of kidney cancer symptoms, diagnosis, care, and social determinants of health with kidney cancer patients (n=50), individuals without cancer in community settings (n=50), and community urologists and health care providers (n=10) in minority servicing primary care clinics (SA 1). Differences in clinical characteristics at diagnosis and types and timing of surgical care received between AI, HA patients and NHW patients will be determined, and then associations between these differences and overall survival will be assessed (SA2). The results from SA1 and SA2 will be integrated to develop a theory of kidney cancer surgical disparities.  Our long-term goal is to develop intervention studies to improve kidney cancer care in racial/ethnic minority groups with a heavy kidney cancer burden. This study will identify specific areas to focus on to reduce knowledge gaps and barriers to care and develop a theory on kidney cancer surgical disparities to be tested. Culturally-adapted materials will be developed to educate AI/AN and HA patients in clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reducing kidney cancer surgical disparities may also reduce kidney cancer burden in American Indians and Hispanic Americans who have high kidney cancer mortality rates compared to non-Hispanic Whites. This project will understand the difference in knowledge on kidney cancer and diagnosis and treatment experience between two racial/ethnic minority groups, American Indian and Hispanic Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites through in-depth interviews with kidney cancer survivors, participants from communities, and health care providers. How delay in diagnosis and surgical treatment and selection of surgical treatment affect overall survival will be examined through analysis of clinical data from Banner University Medical Center, Arizona Cancer Registry, and National Cancer Database.",A Mixed Method to Identify Causes of Kidney Cancer Surgical Disparities in Arizona,9943342,R21CA248361,"['Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' tertiary prevention ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' theories ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Kidney Cancer ', ' Kidney Carcinoma ', ' Renal Cancer ', ' Renal carcinoma ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Population-Based Registry ', ' Subgroup ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community setting ', ' minimally invasive ', ' social health determinants ', ' data registry ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' predict survival ', ' predictor of survival ', ' survival prediction ', ' rurality ', ' primary care services ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Arizona ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Renal Cell Carcinoma ', ' Grawitz Tumor ', ' Hypernephroid Carcinoma ', ' Hypernephroma ', ' Nephroid Carcinoma ', ' Renal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Cancer ', ' kidney adenocarcinoma ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Insurance ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Urologist ', ' Native Americans ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2020,388482,0.11557265228540108
"Patient-Oriented Research Addressing Disparities in Hypertension and Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a proposal for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research for Deidra C. Crews, MD, ScM of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dr. Crews is an Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology, Core Faculty in the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, and Associate Director for Research Development in the Center for Health Equity. Dr. Crews has spent the majority of her career and scholarship focused on patient-oriented research in disadvantaged populations with hypertension and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and CKD, and socioeconomic factors contribute to these disparities. Racial disparities in CKD are most profound among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Low socioeconomic status (SES) and limited availability of healthy foods contribute to poor dietary patterns which influence CKD risk. There is evidence from observational studies that adherence to healthy dietary patterns, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, may substantially reduce risk of CKD and short-term randomized trials suggest the adoption of a healthy diet in adults with CKD may reduce risk of disease progression. The important problem to be addressed by the applicant over the proposed 5-year K24 award period is that low SES African Americans with hypertension and CKD face multiple barriers to healthful eating which can lead to their poor outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and ESRD. This K24 award will protect time for the applicant to mentor junior investigators and conduct significant research aimed at developing sustainable dietary interventions for individuals at high risk for poor clinical outcomes related to hypertension and CKD. The proposed original research will be conducted in the context of the Five, Plus Nuts and Beans for Kidneys trial, a randomized controlled dietary intervention study of low SES African Americans with hypertension and CKD, and will (a) elucidate experiences of recent intervention-arm (Coaching-DASH) participants determining their views on intervention components and factors facilitating or impeding their dietary changes, (b) examine the purchase patterns of the usual care group (Shopping-DASH), who received a trackable gift card to a local grocer but no guidance on purchases and (c) characterize and determine the impact of financial resource strain (defined as housing and/or food insecurity) on the primary and secondary outcomes of the trial—reductions in urinary albumin excretion and blood pressure. These aims will be addressed while Dr. Crews provides mentorship to new and existing junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows and students. Work performed during the K24 award will both inform future intervention design and implementation approaches to maximize sustainability of the applicant’s work, and will allow her to more effectively pursue her long-term career goals to improve outcomes for disadvantaged populations with or at risk for CKD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Racial/ethnic minorities and low income individuals are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease, including a 3 to 4-fold greater risk of kidney failure among African Americans as compared to whites. Effective, sustainable interventions to reduce these disparities are needed urgently. This application will support a practicing nephrologist and researcher with a longstanding commitment to understanding and addressing these disparities in her efforts to gain new knowledge in implementation research methods while also providing outstanding mentorship for junior investigators developing research to achieve health equity.",Patient-Oriented Research Addressing Disparities in

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,9884783,R01HL141892,"['Affect ', ' Albumins ', ' Restrictive Cardiomyopathy ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Transplantation ', ' Cardiac Transplantation ', ' Heart Grafting ', ' cardiac graft ', ' cardiovascular transplantation ', ' heart transplant ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Insurance ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Laboratories ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' lung transplant ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Patient Rights ', ' Perfusion ', ' Prostitution ', ' commercial sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' survival sex ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Liver Failure ', ' Hepatic Failure ', ' forest ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Hypoalbuminemia ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Ejection Fraction ', ' EFRAC ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' time use ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transplant registry ', ' transplant data base ', ' transplant database ', ' clinical practice ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematical methods ', ' cardiac cachexia ', ' improved outcome ', ' transplant centers ', ' cardiodevice ', ' cardiac device ', ' risk prediction model ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' post-transplant ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2020,779535,0.06913361874510784
"The effect of socioeconomic status and environment characteristics on disparate postdonation health outcomes between Black and White living kidney donors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Each year in the US, 6000+ healthy individuals donate a kidney to a loved one, friend or stranger amounting to 142,111 individuals who have donated since 1988. For these healthy individuals, live donor nephrectomy is associated with a 25-40% decline in renal function, which increases their risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, recent evidence suggests that Black living kidney donors are at an even higher risk of these long-term morbidities than White donors. The 15-year postdonation risk of ESRD for Black donors is 154 per 10,000 compared to 49 per 10,000 for White donors. While compelling evidence points to genetic risk factors as key components of this difference, a substantial knowledge gap exists regarding the contribution of socioeconomic status (SES) and local environment of donors. Routine postdonation follow-up and care management could potentially identify early events on the pathway to CKD and ESRD – including diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN) and glomerulonephritis (GN) as these conditions are easily detected with routine vital signs, and blood and urine tests. Our group recently reported that only 50% of transplant hospitals achieve the mandated, routine follow-up for their donors. Further, follow- up attrition is associated with donors that are young, black, male, uninsured, and with fewer years of education. It is possible that socioeconomic and local environment disadvantage may potentiate follow-up attrition and increase rate of progression to CKD/ESRD in an already genetically at risk population. To better understand the impact of SES and environment on post-donation CKD/ESRD, we will leverage a major, ongoing, R01-funded, multicenter study that uses survey data linked to administrative databases to address the following aims: (1) To characterize the SES and local environment resources of Black vs. White living kidney donors; (2) To quantify the postdonation risk of CKD/ESRD attributable to low SES and disadvantaged environments; and (3) To examine health behavior of Black vs. White donors according to SES and environment. These aims are highly feasible given the rich primary data collection of parent study. We hypothesize that Black and White donors with low SES and from disadvantaged environments will have a higher incidence of postdonation DM, HTN, GN and CKD/ESRD. If the proposed aims are achieved, we will have a better understanding of which variables modify the relationship between race and outcomes and at what threshold of social disadvantage a difference is observed. It could also change clinical practice by 1) informing personalized follow-up care plans based on donor social circumstances, and (2) preventing exclusion of disadvantaged populations from national-based monitoring interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the US, the 6000+ healthy individuals who donate a kidney to a loved one, friend or stranger amounting to a total of 142,111 individuals who have donated since 1988, will experience a 25-40% decline in renal function, which increases their risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Recent evidence suggests that Black living kidney donors are at an even higher risk of these long- term morbidities than White donors, and while compelling evidence points to genetic risk factors as key drivers of the disparity, the relative contribution of socioeconomic status (SES) and environmental context is unknown. The goal of the proposed research project is to better understand the impact of socioeconomic status and local environment characteristics on postdonation CKD/ESRD, which will be immediately clinically applicable as it will (1) inform personalized follow-up care plans based on donor social circumstances, and (2) prevent exclusion of disadvantaged populations from national-based monitoring interventions.",The effect of socioeconomic status and environment characteristics on disparate postdonation health outcomes between Black and White living kidney donors,9949704,F32DK117563,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Censuses ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Glomerulonephritis ', ' Bright Disease ', ' Heymann Nephritis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Reducing Disparities among Kidney Transplant Recipients Abstract: Disparities exist in access and outcomes of kidney transplantation. More than half of patients are hospitalized in the year after transplantation, and these patients are more likely AA and have lower socioeconomic status. Several studies have identified risk factors for hospital admission using traditional statistical methods, but models have been limited by moderate predictive accuracy, the use of static (rather than dynamic) models, and the use of administrative data that may not capture the changing risk factors pre- to post-transplant. The overall goal of this research is to develop and validate rigorous, dynamic risk prediction models, integrate these models within a clinician dashboard, and develop potential interventions to address surgical disparities in hospitalization following kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are 1) To develop and validate predictive models to identify transplant recipients at high risk of hospitalization following transplant; 2) To use a community-based participatory research approach to build an electronic hospitalization risk dashboard that will aid in clinical decision-making and guide the use of scarce resources for patients at high risk for hospitalization post-transplant. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant outcomes and reduce disparities among a primarily AA ESRD population in the Southeastern US. Project Narrative/Relevance: The proposed study seeks to utilize predictive analytics to develop and validate risk prediction models to identify patients at high risk for hospitalization following kidney transplantation, integrate the models into an existing clinical decision support platform for population health management, and use a community-based participatory research approach to inform development of a dashboard to deploy resources that will help improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities in kidney transplantation.",Reducing Disparities among Kidney Transplant Recipients,9907867,R01MD011682,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' time use ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' data visualization ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' dashboard ', ' compare cost effectiveness ', ' comparative cost effectiveness ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' transplant centers ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' post-transplant ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' datamart ', ' Data Mart ', ' clinical encounter ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,499888,0.10316886172741535
"MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CKD Project Summary  The purpose of the renewal of this mid-career investigator award titled, “Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in CKD (MADRAD)” by Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, MD, MPH, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Pediatrics and Public Health at the University California Irvine School of Medicine and UCLA School of Public Health, is to provide him with significant protected time to continue and expand his ongoing patient-oriented research endeavors with heightened focus on mentoring early-career investigators in several University of California and Veterans Affairs-affiliated campuses in Southern California. These centers provide care to underserved, indigent populations and minorities who suffer from CKD and who require dialysis for survival. In the US, African Americans and Hispanics have a substantially higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (3.5 and 1.5 times higher, respectively) than non-Hispanic Whites. While the overall 5-year survival of ESRD patients is less than 40%, with the highest mortality risk observed among malnourished patients, minority dialysis patients exhibit lower mortality. Discovering the roots of CKD racial survival differences and the contribution of nutritional status and dietary factors to these disparities may have major clinical and public health implications.  The PI hypothesizes that these disparities are due to distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms related to nutritional status and dietary intake across race/ethnicity. Several alternative hypotheses related to racial/ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms, bone and mineral disorders, mental health and psychosocial factors, and dialysis treatment characteristics will also be examined. The PI proposes a 5-year prospective patient-oriented research study with repeated measures in a dynamic cohort of 1,500 hemodialysis (HD) patients (1/3 African American and 1/3 Hispanic), in collaboration with Southern California dialysis clinics. Nutritional status, dietary intake, psychosocial status, quality of life, clinical events, and survival will be longitudinally assessed. Genetic factors such as APOL1 risk alleles will also be examined, and biospecimens for future ancillary studies will be stored. In a substudy of 360 subjects, additional tests of body composition and dietary intake will be performed. Race/ethnicity specific risk-stratification scores will be developed and validated in a national retrospective cohort of over 150,000 HD patients.  The support of the K24 award for this prospective study will allow PI to achieve the following goals: (1) Continue to expand his productive activities and capabilities as a mentor and facilitator for early-career investigators in renal nutrition and CKD disparities by leveraging his networking relationships across several campuses and centers including the University of California system and its Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Kaiser Permanente of Southern Calif., UCLA Public Health, and LA and Orange County Health Departments; (2) continue to expand his persistent efforts in increasing the participation of minority populations in CKD research studies across Southern California; and (3) continue his cultivation of an innovative area of CKD disparities and nutrition research through promising early career investigators and the ongoing support of collaborators in Southern California. The data and hypotheses generated during this 5-year cohort study will be utilized to promote additional patient-oriented studies by mentees under Dr. Kalantar to improve patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Relevance of Research to Public Health  Examining racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and their relationship with nutritional status, diet, genetic factors, and outcomes in dialysis patients may lead to the development of more effective strategies to improve the survival and quality of life of dialysis patients, an additional 20 million CKD patients, and an additional 30 to 40 million Americans who suffer from chronic disease states associated with wasting disorders such as chronic heart failure. Training and mentoring early-career investigators in CKD disparities and kidney disease nutrition will enhance these important objectives.","MALNUTRITION, DIET AND RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

"Living Donor Wage Reimbursement Trial PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The waiting list for kidney transplantation (KT) now exceeds 100,000 and waiting times exceed 7 yrs in some U.S. regions. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) accelerates the path to transplantation and yields superior outcomes compared to dialysis and deceased donor KT. However, the annual number of LDKTs has declined over the last decade, particularly among minority and low-income patients. We hypothesize, and have preliminary data to support, that the financial impact on living donors (LDs) is a major contributor to the LDKT decline and for persistent racial disparities in LDKT rates. Many LDs have substantial non-reimbursed direct and indirect costs, most notably the loss of income or wages following surgery. In this study, we will: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of offering reimbursement for LD lost wages on the LDKT rate; (2) examine whether offering reimbursement for LD lost wages reduces known racial disparities in LDKT; and (3) determine whether study outcomes differ significantly by maximum reimbursement amount for LD lost wages. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a blended randomized trial and matched historical control study with a planned enrollment of 350 KT candidates who will be randomized to one of two parallel arms: (1) possible reimbursement of LD lost wages up to $1,500 (LW-1.5), or (2) possible reimbursement of LD lost wages up to $3,000 (LW-3.0). Our central hypotheses are that offering reimbursement for LD lost wages will (a) yield higher LDKT rates overall relative to matched historical controls, and (b) reduce the disparity between LDKT rates in white and minority patients relative to historical patterns. Also, we hypothesize that KT candidates who are offered up to $3,000 reimbursement for LD lost wages will have a higher likelihood of LDKT compared to those offered up to $1,500 of reimbursement for LD lost wages. Finally, we will assess the impact of offering reimbursement for LD lost wages on the decision-making of both KT candidates and potential LDs as well as perceptions of pressure/coercion and decision stability. Overall, the proposed study will be the first to empirically examine the impact of offering LD lost wages reimbursement on the willingness of KT candidates to pursue LDKT, racial disparity in LDKT, rates of LD evaluations, and actual LDKT rates. Moreover, this study will be the first to examine the differential impact on these outcomes of offering to reimburse LD lost wages for different amounts ($1,500 vs. $3,000) after donation. As such, findings from this study have very high potential to impact policy, clinical practice, LDKT access, and known income and racial disparities in KT. The assembled interdisciplinary research team has a long track record of collaboration and is internationally recognized for developing innovative strategies to increase LDKT access in disadvantaged patient populations, extramural funding to conduct large RCTs and multi-center studies, and dissemination of research findings with broad policy and clinical practice implications. PROJECT NARRATIVE This application is responsive to numerous calls within the transplant field to empirically evaluate the benefits and costs associated with removing financial disincentives for living kidney donors. If successful, findings from this study will directly address several HealthyPeople2020 objectives (Objectives: CKD HP2020-2, CKD HP2020-5, CKD HP2020-6, CKD HP2020-13), recommendations made in the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) report on organ donation, and recommendations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation.

"Genetics of kidney disease in diverse populations ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease affects one in 10 people worldwide, and it contributes to premature morbidity and death. The underlying mechanisms for its development and predisposition are unknown, limiting progress in the identification of prognostic biomarkers or the development of treatment interventions. There are known ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease risk, yet little research has been done in diverse (non-European) populations. Studies have identified several ancestral variants (e.g., APOL1, sickle cell) conferring risk of chronic kidney disease in persons of African ancestry including admixed Hispanics/Latinos. To better understand the genetic risk for chronic kidney disease across diverse populations, we recently established the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network Kidney (COGENT-Kidney) Consortium, which includes 71,638 participants from four major ancestral groups (African, Hispanic/Latino, European and East Asian). Using novel trans-ethnic meta-analysis approaches, we identified 20 loci for kidney function and showed important gains in uncovering functional variants within loci using diverse populations. The current proposal seeks to provide important needed information to address the contribution of ancestry-specific variants to the natural history of chronic kidney disease phenotypes in under-studied Hispanics/Latinos (Aim 1), by leveraging the comprehensive longitudinal data in over 12,000 participants of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latino. To identify novel genetic loci and underlying mechanisms that are relevant to all ancestries, we propose to recruit additional studies to the COGENT-Kidney Consortium for an unprecedented trans-ethnic meta-analysis of kidney traits, including a total of over 622,000 participants from diverse populations (East and South Asian, Hispanic/Latino, African and African American, American Indian, and white) (Aim 2). We will prioritize genes to test their functional role in in vitro experiments and mouse models of kidney injury (Aim 3). Our results can provide important insight into genetic contributions to ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease risk and to inform on molecular mechanisms related to chronic kidney disease development. Ultimately, this research could inform personalized medicine and improve the understanding and management of kidney health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will leverage existing genetic, clinical and biomarker data to identify and characterize genetic risk factors for kidney disease in several ethnic populations.

"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and serious chronic disease that often leads to end-stage renal disease and major cardiovascular events. Although evidence-based CKD care can slow disease progression and avert complications, less than 10% of CKD patients currently receive major elements of CKD care in a timely fashion. The objective of this project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a technology-driven and team-based intervention to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes for patients with stage 3-4 CKD. The proposed intervention uses a sophisticated Web-based clinical decision support (CDS) system that is seamlessly integrated within the electronic health record (EHR) to: (a) identify adults with CKD at primary care encounters; (b) suggest personalized evidence-based treatment options to increase the appropriate use of renoprotective antihypertensive medications, improve blood pressure control, and improve glycemic management in patients with diabetes; and (c) suggest to patients and providers when collaboration and consultation with nephrologists may be advisable. We rigorously test the impact of the intervention by randomly assigning 30 primary care clinics with approximately 120 primary care physicians and 6100 adults with evidence of stage 3-4 CKD to the CDS intervention versus usual care and assess intervention impact on 5 key evidence-based elements of care for patients with CKD: (i.) recognition and diagnosis of CKD in patients who meet diagnostic criteria; (ii.) adequate blood pressure control; (iii.) optimal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use; (iv.) adequate glucose control; and (v.) nephrology consultation when appropriate. The intervention, referred to as CKD-CDS, provides patient-specific and stage-specific CKD treatment options in high- and low-literacy formats to the primary care provider (PCP) and patients at each primary care encounter to facilitate shared decision making. This CKD-CDS will be implemented using previously successful methods that in previous CDS studies have achieved very high use rates with patients (>75% of targeted patient encounters) for diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Scalability of this NIH- developed, non-commercialized intervention strategy is supported by its current use (without the CKD identification or specific recommendations) in 4 large medical groups that provide care to 2,000,000 patients in rural and urban areas in 4 Midwestern states, with research contracts to extend use to more than 60 safety net clinics in an additional 14 states in 2018. If the addition of CKD-CDS to this tool is effective, the intervention is immediately scalable and could (a) improve quality of care for large numbers of CKD patients, thereby slowing progression of CKD and improving quality of life, (b) maximize the clinical return on massive public and private investments now being made in sophisticated outpatient EHR systems, and (c) provide a health informatics prototype that rapidly and consistently translates evolving evidence-based CKD clinical guidelines into delivery of personalized and coordinated CKD care within primary care settings. Project Narrative To prevent serious chronic kidney disease (CKD) complications such as end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events, better strategies are needed to identify, treat, and refer CKD patients seen in primary care clinics. This project expands an existing and successful non-proprietary Web-based clinical decision support system to include key elements of CKD care and rigorously assesses the impact of this intervention on quality of CKD care for patients seen in primary care settings, including better recognition of CKD, better management of blood pressure and glucose, and more timely referral to nephrologists when appropriate. This low-cost and highly scalable intervention has high potential to improve CKD care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of patients with CKD.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care,10004030,R18DK118463,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Albumins ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Consultations ', ' Creatinine ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrolytes ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Hypotension ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrology ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Private Sector ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Sector ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Angiotensin Receptor ', ' Recommendation ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Contracts ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' safety net ', ' prototype ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' hypertension management ', ' hypertension control ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' clinical decision support ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIDDK,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R18,2020,485836,0.12854727821437756
"Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program Project Summary/Abstract The applicant for this competing renewal of a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is James Lash, MD, a Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). During the initial four years of support by this award, Dr. Lash has had a strong record of mentorship and research productivity. During this time, his productivity as a mentor has increased significantly as reflected by 25 trainee-led manuscripts, the receipt of four K23 awards and one Diversity Supplement, the academic promotion of two faculty members, and the proposed promotion of two others. Of note, over one-half of Dr. Lash's trainees are underrepresented minorities. Dr. Lash's research focuses on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a particular emphasis on minority populations. He has considerable experience as a patient- oriented researcher and is the Principal Investigator for several NIH-sponsored studies: 1) the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study UIC Clinical Center, 2) the Hispanic CRIC Study, and 3) the UIC PI for the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). In addition, during the funding period his research portfolio has further expanded with him becoming PI for the Fogarty International Center-sponsored Mexico CRIC Study based in Mexico City, Co-PI for the NHLBI-funded Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Chicago Field Center, and Associate Director for a T32 program focused on health disparities in minority populations. This comprehensive research program provides a wealth of opportunities for his trainees. The overarching objective of the proposed new research program for this K24 renewal is to evaluate the impact of two potentially modifiable health behaviors (sedentary behavior and sleep) on health outcomes in patients with CKD. This research will leverage Dr. Lash's leadership role in large ongoing observational studies with substantial representation of racial/ethnic minorities. In addition, the research program will also include a pilot intervention focused on reducing sedentary behavior and improving sleep quality in adults with CKD. In addition to its focus on areas of significance, the proposed research will provide trainees with a rich range of opportunities in patient-oriented research in CKD. Trainees will also participate in didactic training through the School of Public Health and have access to the extensive resources and infrastructure provided by the Center for Clinical Translational Science. The renewal of this K24 award will provide Dr. Lash with the protected time and resources to continue to expand his successful research program and continue to provide productive mentorship of new physician scientists to develop the skills needed to become independent investigators in kidney disease research. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease afflicts more than 26 million individuals in the United States and it is well established that racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by this chronic condition. Despite the critical need for more research in this area, decreasing numbers of trainees are choosing careers in academic nephrology. The strengths of this K24 renewal application are as follows: the applicant's robust research program focusing on chronic kidney disease in minorities, his successful track record in mentoring new clinician investigators during the first period of funding, the comprehensive plan for mentoring and developing the careers of new physician scientists, the strong institutional support and resources at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and an innovative research proposal investigating the impact of two potentially modifiable health behaviors (sedentary behavior and sleep) on health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease.",Health Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease Mentoring Program,9991837,K24DK092290,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ',

"integrating conservative kidney management options and advance care planning into a pre-dialysis educational program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pre-dialysis education programs are the standard of care for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) to learn about their options for treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, these programs do not usually include education about conservative kidney management (CKM) or advance care planning. Informed decision-making about dialysis treatments becomes especially important for elderly and frail patients with advanced CKD as they may experience frequent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and early death once they are initiated on dialysis. There are also racial disparities in dialysis knowledge, advance care planning and end-of-life (EOL) preferences between Black and White patients with advanced CKD that have been attributed to Blacks having less understanding of their treatment options. Advance care planning education has been used to improve decision-making among diverse cohorts of chronic hemodialysis patients however the integration of CKM and advance care planning education into pre-dialysis education programs in order to improve knowledge and communication of care options while also reducing racial disparities has not been well studied. The proposed scientific program has three research aims: (1) To conduct an open pilot study of an educational intervention (Conservative Kidney Management Options and Advance Care Planning Education – COPE) that is integrated into standard pre-dialysis education among frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD to assess its feasibility and acceptability, (2) To test, in a pilot randomized controlled trial, the preliminary efficacy of COPE on improving knowledge of CKM and advance care planning and increasing communication about ESRD treatment and EOL care preferences among frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD, and (3) To explore whether COPE reduces racial disparities in CKM and advance care planning knowledge as well as communication of ESRD and EOL care preferences among Black and White frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD. Dr. Eneanya proposes a career development program that includes methodological training and mentorship by senior faculty to develop and evaluate knowledge assessment tools, engage effectively with seriously ill patient populations, and pilot an intervention to detect racial differences in treatment knowledge and end-of-life communication. The long-term goal of this career development award is to develop Dr. Eneanya into an independent health services researcher with expertise in survey research methods, informed decision-making models of care, and clinical trials among minority and renal populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the United States, elderly and frail patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly initiated on dialytic treatments despite the unclear effects on mortality and quality of life for this population. Furthermore, racial minority patients are diagnosed more frequently with advanced CKD but experience barriers to informed dialysis decision-making and quality end-of-life care. The proposed study seeks to test a pre-dialysis educational intervention to promote informed treatment decision-making, improve advance care planning, and decrease racial disparities in treatment knowledge and communication of care preferences among Black and White frail and elderly patients with advanced CKD.",integrating conservative kidney management options and advance care planning into a pre-dialysis educational program,9947918,K23DK114526,"['Acids ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Anemia ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electrolytes ', ' Family ', ' Fluid Balance ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Program Development ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' frail older adult ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' education planning ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial support ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' end of life communication ', ' end-of-life communication ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Secure ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' full professor ', ' senior faculty ', ' racial minority ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' physical symptom ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,167940,0.07383286432006815
"Reducing disparities in living donor transplant among African Americans Abstract For most of the patients in the United States with end stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplantation represents the optimal treatment. Moreover, living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) offers numerous advantages over deceased donor kidney transplant such as better kidney quality, increased short- and long- term graft survival, lower rates of acute rejection, and reduced health care cost. Nevertheless, there are pervasive racial disparities in access to LDKT, with white ESRD patients four times more likely to receive a LDKT than African American ESRD patients. The long-term objective of this program of research is to understand the combined effect of a systems-level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians (Transplant Referral EXchange or T-REX) and a culturally-sensitive individual-level educational intervention (web-based Living ACTS: About Choices in Transplantation and Sharing) on racial disparities in access to LDKT. The specific aims of the study are: (a) To develop and refine a web-based version of Living ACTS; (b) To conduct an outcome evaluation of the newly created web-based Living ACTS intervention by comparing the percent of patients with at least one inquiry from a potential living donor among patients who receive Living ACTS compared to those who receive a control website with an embedded educational video; and (c) To conduct a process evaluation of the newly created web-based Living ACTS intervention by adapting commonly used process evaluation constructs (context, reach, dose received, fidelity, and recruitment) for an online environment. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among a sample of 800 African American ESRD patients in the southeastern United States (ESRD Network 6 in Georgia and South Carolina), the region of the country with the largest proportion of African American ESRD patients on the waiting list. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions (intervention or control). Participants at all four collaborating transplant centers will be seen by providers who utilize T-REX, thus allowing us to test the independent effect of individual-level education on a systems-level intervention. The primary outcome is the percent of patients with at least one living donor inquiry. Secondary outcomes will test the effect of the intervention on key constructs of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to determine possible mediating pathways. Participants will undergo baseline assessment, access either the intervention or control educational materials, and complete an immediate follow-up assessment. Living donor inquiries will be examined over the subsequent 12 months. The process evaluation will utilize transplant center administrative records, immediate follow-up data from participants, website usage statistics, and study records. It is anticipated that achievement of these aims will yield outcomes with great clinical and public health impact. Narrative There are pervasive racial disparities in access to living donor kidney transplant, which for the majority of end stage renal disease patient represents the optimal treatment. The proposed study seeks to determine whether a systems-level intervention that enhances communication between dialysis facility and transplant center clinicians coupled with culturally-sensitive individual level education is more effective at increasing access to living donor kidney transplant among African Americans than the systems-level intervention alone. In doing so, this study seeks to have a positive impact on public health and the vision of NIDDK, part of which is to seek insights and answers regarding health disparities in end stage renal disease.",Reducing disparities in living donor transplant among African Americans,9919556,R01DK114891,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Grant ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Motivation ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeast US ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Friends ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' stem ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' trial design ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' Wait Time ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' transplant centers ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' live kidney donor ', ' living kidney donor ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,231134,0.10368551800856261
"The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD ABSTRACT: Racial inequalities in kidney and end stage renal diseases (ESRD) have been well-documented and are independent of lower socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education), lower access to care, or other conventional risk factors. Research has identified numerous genetic risk factors of renal disease, particularly the APOL1 variants occurring in persons of African descent. However, these genetic factors primarily increase susceptibility, requiring other factors for the development of disease. A growing body of research indicates the importance of neighborhoods for health and health inequalities. Unequal neighborhood contexts may be an important and largely unexplored determinant of the increased kidney disease risk experienced by Blacks compared to Whites. In fact, neighborhood context may interact with genetic susceptibility to result in kidney disease inequalities. Clarifying the role of neighborhood is important as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring. They develop and change through policies and are thus amenable to intervention. Despite the evidence indicating the importance of neighborhoods for the major risk factors and determinants of kidney disease, there is a dearth of empirical research on the role of neighborhoods in relation to kidney disease itself, particularly at pre-ESRD stages. The primary challenges to research in this area are: (a) the lack of skilled researchers with training in both social science and the pathophysiology and genetic science of kidney disease; and (b) the paucity of datasets that contain high quality neighborhood and clinical and genetic measures. To reach my long-term career goal to become a successful, independent researcher who clarifies the social causes and genetic and biomedical mechanisms of racial CKD inequalities, I will address the current scientific challenges through the proposed training and research, respectively by: (a) complementing my early work in the biological sciences and extensive training in the social sciences with extensive training in the pathophysiology and genetics of kidney disease; and (b) creating state-of-the-art neighborhood measures to existing datasets with high quality repeat clinical measures of renal function and damage. I will address three career goals:  1. To obtain formal training in renal physiology and pathophysiology.  2. To develop expertise in genetic epidemiology and population genetics pertaining to racial inequalities in  kidney disease.  3. To take the first step toward independence through an R01 submission. My training will include mentorship and collaboration with leading experts in the genetics and pathophysiology of CKD inequalities, formal coursework in genetic epidemiology, statistical/population genetics, and renal physiology/pathophysiology, and multiple conferences and workshops on the substantive topics of genetics, race, and CKD and on professional development. Through my research project, I will use three cohorts (Health and Retirement Study, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network) to examine the interactive associations between multiple measures of four neighborhood domains (racial residential segregation, social environment, built environment, and health care resources) and genetic risk (APOL1 and β-globin HBB genotypes, adjusting for genetic ancestry), as follows:  Aim 1: Link state-of-the-art measures of four domains of neighborhood context to population-representative,  epidemiological, and clinical cohort datasets containing markers of kidney disease.  Aim 2: Examine longitudinal associations between neighborhood context and renal health, with adjustment  for genetic ancestry and APOL1 genotype.  Aim 3: Examine the modifying role of neighborhood context on longitudinal associations between APOL1  high-risk genotype status and renal health. With this training and dataset creation, I will then clarify the neighborhood characteristics that are most tightly linked to renal outcomes both directly and through their interactions with genetic risk loci. This research will set a solid foundation for research on neighborhood characteristics and inequalities in kidney disease. Not only will this research clarify the interdependent roles of neighborhood and genetic risk on these inequalities, but it will identify key neighborhood characteristics, which are amenable to change, related to kidney disease within and between racial groups. UM is the ideal venue for my training and research as it is internationally recognized as a leading research institution that strongly supports interdisciplinary science. I joined the faculty both at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) because of its commitment to interdisciplinary research, and Nephrology because of its commitment to clarifying the social exposures that contribute to kidney disease. Within ISR, the Nephrology Division, and School of Public Health, I will acquire rigorous training and develop solid collaborations devoted to the clarification of the social and genetic causes of racial inequalities in CKD. NARRATIVE: Racial inequalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been well-documented but are not well-understood. Recent research suggests an important role for genetics such as the high risk variants of the gene, APOL1, encoding the apolipoprotein L1, present only in persons of African descent. However, research also points to neighborhoods as an important source of health inequalities and clarifying its role is critical as neighborhoods are neither random nor naturally-occurring and are amenable to change. In fact, it may be that neighborhood environments may result in CKD through their interaction with genetic susceptibility. Using three complementary cohorts, I will examine the interactive effects between specific neighborhood characteristics and APOL1 on longitudinal measures of CKD.",The Interactive Roles of Neighborhood Characteristics and Genetic Risk in Racial Inequalities in CKD,10226394,K01DK106322,"['Apolipoproteins ', ' beta Globin ', ' B-globin ', ' β-globin ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Censuses ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Science of genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Mentorship ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nephrotic Syndrome ', ' Physiology ', ' Privatization ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' African ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' built environment ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' renal damage ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,52594,0.03983428540338788
"Health system outreach to eliminate disparities in living kidney transplants PROJECT SUMMARY Despite their nearly four-fold greater incidence of end stage kidney disease compared to Whites, African Americans have lower rates of early living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), an optimal treatment for end stage kidney disease. Disparities in receipt of LDKT have worsened over the past decade. At least four critical roadblocks hinder patients’ journey along the path to receiving LDKTs, including their lack of awareness of their need for LDKT; poor knowledge of LDKT and difficulties discussing LDKT with family and physicians; infrequent or sluggish referrals for early transplant evaluations; and difficulty completing the multi-step transplant evaluation process. African Americans may more frequently face these critical roadblocks when compared to others. Rigorously studied interventions simultaneously addressing these critical roadblocks do not exist. Health systems have numerous capabilities (including information and staffing resources) that could be creatively leveraged to address the multiple critical roadblocks to LDKT that contribute to disparities. However, studies quantifying the effectiveness of interventions which harness and coordinate health system resources to mitigate LDKT disparities have not been performed, leaving an evidence gap. We propose to study an innovative intervention, “Health System Surveillance and Outreach,” designed to overcome multiple roadblocks which lead to LDKT disparities. We will conduct a comparative effectiveness trial to quantify the effectiveness of ‘Health System Surveillance and Outreach’ compared to usual care to mitigate race disparities in LDKT. Our study will be conducted within two large health systems in the Southern US, where disparities in kidney disease are extremely prevalent, and where LDKT is most desperately needed. Health System Surveillance and Outreach will integrate a surveillance registry into electronic health information systems to identify all potential candidates for pre-emptive or early LDKT early and equitably by using patients’ laboratory data and a validated computer-generated kidney disease progression risk prediction algorithm. Transplant social workers and coordinators, who are already embedded in transplant teams, will ‘reach out’ to identified potential LDKT candidates to help them address contextual factors (including educational, social, logistical, and navigation needs) that pose roadblocks to LDKT. Our two primary outcomes will measure patients’ initiation and completion of kidney transplant evaluations using health system records. We will also measure the effectiveness of our navigation support on the kidney transplant evaluation process. This study will provide evidence needed to eliminate LDKT disparities in the South and across the nation. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans have persistently received live donor kidney transplants (LDKTs), an optimal treatment for end stage kidney disease, at lower rates than other Americans, due to multiple roadblocks. Health systems have capabilities that can address these roadblocks, but they have not been coordinated to improve disparities in LDKT. This project will study whether innovative health system interventions can improve equity in LDKT and eliminate race LDKT disparities.",Health system outreach to eliminate disparities in living kidney transplants,10167095,U01DK127918,"['Awareness ', ' Counseling ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Workers ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Logistics ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Health Information System ', ' outreach ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' outreach program ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' computer generated ', ' effective intervention ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' primary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' transplant centers ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' live kidney donor ', ' living kidney donor ', ' comparative effectiveness trial ', ' ']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,5926967,0.17600905218250462
"Living Donor Extended Time Outcomes (LETO) Study PROJECT SUMMARY We are submitting this competitive revision application in response to NOT-DK-20-012 to expand our existing R01DK120551 project titled “Living donor Extended Time Outcomes (LETO).” The parent LETO study will recruit a national sample of 1,100 black living kidney donors to assess their health status ~15-20 years after donation. The primary aim of the original application is to determine in a national sample whether black living kidney donors with 2 apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants are at higher risk of developing clinically significant chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 ml/min/1.73m2) approximately two decades after donation.” Only black donors are targeted for enrollment into the parent LETO study. In this revision R01DK120551 application, we propose to add enrollment of 500 white living kidney donors, which will convert LETO into a powerful research platform to study racial disparities. This expansion will allow us to address a new aim: to quantify and compare the risk of developing clinically significant chronic kidney disease approximately two decades after donation in a national sample of black vs. white living kidney donors, and to quantify the relative importance of biologic (genetic, unmodifiable) vs. non- biologic (non-genetic, potentially modifiable) factors contributing to any observed health disparity. We will use the same cost-effective “hybrid” study design—jointly analyzing data collected at home-based research visits together with data collected as part of clinical care (as entered into a national registry)—that greatly increases the number of person-years of follow-up and enhances study power. We believe that findings from this study will strongly advocate for the adoption of policies such as such as mechanisms for improved long-term follow-up and provision of lifelong health insurance to living donors--justified not only as a moral imperative but also as a powerful tool to reduce racial disparities in access to living donor transplant. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to expand our existing project titled “Living donor Extended Time Outcomes (LETO)” by enrolling an additional 500 white living kidney donors and convert LETO into a powerful research platform to study racial disparities. We hypothesize that black Americans have worse outcomes after kidney donation than white Americans mostly because of non-biologic (non-genetic, potentially modifiable) and not biologic (genetic, unmodifiable) reasons. Confirming this would provide strong justification for policies such as mechanisms for improved long-term follow-up and provision of lifelong health insurance to living donors.",Living Donor Extended Time Outcomes (LETO) Study,10164513,R01DK120551,"['Adoption ', ' Altruism ', ' altruistic ', ' Americas ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Black race ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Financial cost ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Morals ', ' Persons ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Politics ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' Living Donors ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Exclusion ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' modifiable risk ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' nongenetic ', ' non-genetic ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' clinical risk ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' screening ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' improved outcome ', ' treatment choice ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' live kidney donor ', ' living kidney donor ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,844088,0.14981786583090018
"A Culturally Targeted Transplant Program to Increase Live Donation in Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The shortage of organs for kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is magnified in Hispanics/Latin Americans. Hispanics have a disproportionately higher prevalence of ESRD, yet receive fewer kidney transplants compared to non-Hispanic whites. Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the treatment of choice for ESRD as it confers better patient and graft survival, shorter waiting time, and better quality of life than deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, compared to their representation on the waiting list, fewer Hispanics received a LDKT than non-Hispanic whites in 2013: 4 percent versus 10 percent. Barriers to LDKT for Hispanics include: lack of knowledge, cultural concerns, and language barriers. The disparity will likely worsen without intervention as Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the US.  Few available culturally competent interventions have led to increased LDKT rates. Interventions rarely address Hispanic cultural concerns, and there are no published models of transplant center-based only programs. The Chicago Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program (HKTP), a culturally and linguistically competent program, has increased Hispanic LDKTs. The mean annual ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs grew from 0.20 in 2001-2006 to 0.34 in 2008-2013, a 70 percent increase (p<0.001).  The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the HKTP, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations (Dallas, TX, and Los Angeles, CA), with Northwestern University serving as the Study Coordinating Center. The pre-post HKTP intervention study will evaluate the effect of the HKTP's key culturally sensitive components (outreach, communication, education) on Hispanic LDKT rates, compared to matched controls. The specific aims are to:  1. Implement the HKTP at two transplant centers by conducting a needs assessment of barriers and using a ""learning collaborative"" model to deliver HKTP protocols, scripts, and materials.  2. Conduct a pre-post HKTP intervention evaluation with matched controls to assess if the HKTP is associated with an increase in: a) the ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs as a function of an absolute increase in Hispanic LDKTs, b) ESRD Hispanic patient additions to the waiting list, c) Hispanic potential donors per potential recipient, and d) Hispanic patients' satisfaction with care.  3. Formatively evaluate the fidelity and innovative adaptations to HKTP's outreach, communication, and education at both study sites to identify effective components of the HTKP, using mixed methods.  As an exploratory aim, a budget impact analysis will be conducted to construct a business case for transplant centers and permit estimates of HKTP scalability. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally, improve health outcomes for Hispanics, and close the LDKT disparity gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic/Latino patients with end-stage renal disease are disproportionately less likely to get a kidney transplant, and specifically, a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), compared to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, without LDKTs, Hispanics experience longer transplant waiting times, shorter patient and graft survival, and worse quality of life. Cultural beliefs and linguistic barriers contribute to the disparity in LDKTs. The objectie of the proposed study is to implement and evaluate Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally.",A Culturally Targeted Transplant Program to Increase Live Donation in Hispanics,9893861,R01DK104876,"['Accounting ', ' Belief ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Social Workers ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' satisfaction ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Media Campaign ', ' cultural values ', ' outreach ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' treatment choice ', ' Latin American ', ' Wait Time ', ' transplant centers ', ' transplant model ', ' live kidney donor ', ' living kidney donor ', ' budget impact ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,644778,0.13892423852372274
"Wake Forest Collaborative Application for an APOLLO Clinical Center We are applying to participate as an APOLLO Clinical Center in this national prospective study. The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all U.S. kidney transplantations from African American donors to determine their effects on transplant outcomes. In addition, the health of living African American kidney donors will be assessed. Information that was lacking from prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. Our investigative team, led by two PIs with complementary expertise, has led the way in clinical trials to address the marked disparities in African Americans with end-stage kidney disease. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute. These renal-risk variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease. In contrast, these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may prove to be clinically useful in those with recent African ancestry in the setting of allocation of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and assessment of prospective living kidney donors. Genotypic information (precision medicine) may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. Information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation. However, before these genotypic data can be used in the clinical setting, a prospective national study is required to evaluate kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from prior retrospective studies will be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. This is the rationale and setting for the current APOLLO trial. In this important multi-site study, our site will work closely with the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center and the other participating sites to recruit and prospectively follow eligible kidney donors and transplant recipients based on the APOLLO protocol. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors; reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that donors having kidney disease risk variants in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene may contribute. This APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center application is designed to prospectively evaluate effects of donor and recipient APOL1 genotypes in kidney transplantations performed at 20 affiliated transplant programs. Results from our Center, as part of the national APOLLO study, could help transform organ allocation and informed consent in kidney transplantation, optimize survival of patients after kidney transplantation, and determine the safety of living kidney donation.",Wake Forest Collaborative Application for an APOLLO Clinical Center,9977187,U01DK116040,"['Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Creatinine ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Illinois ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrology ', ' North Carolina ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Work ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Failure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' programs ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' antibody titering ', ' Antibody titer measurement ', ' Allografting ', ' Outcome Study ', ' renal allograft ', ' kidney allograft ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Vital Status ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Aliquot ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' delayed graft function ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' implantation ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' high risk ', ' organ allocation ', ' pre-implantation ', ' preimplantation ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' academic program ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' recruit ', ' live kidney donor ', ' living kidney donor ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2020,346142,0.17609933971647945
"APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center Shorter allograft survival is observed for kidneys transplanted from deceased African American donors relative to those from deceased European American donors. Recent retrospective reports have indicated that the presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in the kidney donors significantly contributes to this disparity. APOL1 renal-risk variants are common in U.S. populations with African ancestry (primarily African Americans) and are strongly associated with end-stage renal disease for patients with non- diabetic kidney disease, yet these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. Before APOL1 genotypic data can be widely applied in the transplant community, however, a prospective multi-center study must be performed to evaluate outcomes of kidneys from donors with African ancestry. Critical clinical post-transplant information that was lacking in the prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, particularly kidney-biopsy data and key potential modifiers such as development of viral infections, donor-specific antibodies, and episodes of acute rejection. The NIH will fund a nationwide prospective study to assess the impact of APOL1 renal-risk variants on the outcomes of recipients of a kidney from a deceased or living donor with African ancestry and on the kidney health of living donors with African ancestry after nephrectomy. The study will consist of as many as 15 Clinical Centers and a central Scientific Data Research Center (SDRC). The Clinical Centers will collect one-time blood samples from each participant for APOL1 genotyping at the SDRC and will submit longitudinal clinical data for the recipients and living donors to the SDRC to assess the impact of APOL1 genotype on development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The results from this national study have the potential to transform organ allocation and informed consent processes in the transplantation of kidneys from donors with African ancestry, improve renal allograft survival, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby APOL1 renal-risk variants produce kidney disease. Specific variants in the gene encoding apolipoprotein L1, which are generally restricted to persons with recent African ancestry, have been associated in retrospective analyses with increased risk of end-stage native- kidney disease and shorter survival of kidney transplants. The proposed prospective study will examine the impact of these variants on kidney-transplant recipients and donors, while taking into account various environmental or comorbid conditions that can cause kidney damage. The findings from this study have the potential to transform allocation of kidneys for transplantation, improve survival of transplanted kidneys, better inform potential kidney donors with recent African ancestry of the risks of donation, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby these genetic variants produce kidney disease.",APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center,9975831,U01DK115997,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Antibodies ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Biopsy ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Creatinine ', ' Cytomegalovirus Infections ', ' CMV infection ', ' Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease ', ' Inclusion Disease ', ' Salivary Gland Virus Disease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Histology ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' indexing ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Ischemia ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lupus Nephritis ', ' Lupus Glomerulonephritis ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Urinary tract infection ', ' Urinary tract infectious disease ', ' urinary infection ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' AIDS-Associated Nephropathy ', ' AIDS Nephropathy ', ' AIDS-Related Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Associated Nephropathy ', ' HIV-Related Nephropathy ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Nephropathy ', ' Generations ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Lesion ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Failure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' renal clearance ', ' Renal clearance function ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' programs ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Allografting ', ' renal allograft ', ' kidney allograft ', ' American ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' organ allocation ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' preservation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' renal biopsy ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' renal damage ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' post-transplant ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2020,346141,0.1687060681782469
"2/2 APOL1 Long-Term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network- Clinical Center Project Summary (Abstract) The Columbia-Penn Clinical Consortium (CPCC) brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team of clinical and basic scientist investigators at Columbia University Medical Center and University of Pennsylvania Transplant Programs. The CPCC investigators have expertise in the fields of transplant epidemiology, immunology, genetics and ethics, as well as an extensive history of collaboration with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and other CPCC member transplant programs. As a result, the CPCC is well suited to recruit and retain patients for longitudinal follow up for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Research Network (APOLLO). This proposed Clinical Center will comprise of 26 pediatric and adult large, medium and small size transplant centers and 9 organ procurement organizations predominantly in four contiguous states (NY, NJ, CT and PA) in the northeast US. Our primary objective is to enroll all donors of African ancestry (e.g. African-Americans and Black Hispanic) and their recipients within the consortium for genetic and genomic studies by the APOLLO Network (Aim 1). We will follow all recruited donor-recipient pairs with longitudinal collection of biospecimens and clinical outcomes along with pragmatic integration with Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), UNOS and the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data (Aim 2). Our experience in the recruitment and retention of minority patients in multicenter studies, as well as the use of innovative analytics with linkage to UNOS, USRDS and other geospatial data, will be of benefit to the APOLLO Network. We expect that our unique design and implementation expertise to the APOLLO study will address the hypothesis that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants is associated with inferior allograft outcomes following kidney transplant and increases the risk of adverse renal outcomes for affected living donors.

"American Indian Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study (AI-CRIC) Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Shah, Vallabh O and Unruh Mark Despite experiencing high levels of kidney disease compared to other ethnic/racial groups in the United States, American Indians (AIs) continue to receive relatively little attention from researchers studying CKD. An example is the current CRIC study, where less than 1% of participants in this flagship study are AIs. Risk factors for diabetic kidney disease, the predominant form of CKD in this population, include the traditional risk factors of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and inheritance, but also other factors such as exposure to various persistent environmental pollutants. The distribution and determinants of CKD among AIs has been understudied, leaving many questions unanswered about the progression of CKD among AIs, as well as the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the setting of CKD among these populations. This is an urgent issue given the public health impact in AI communities and the relative lack of ongoing research. To address this burden of CKD in Native communities we have formed a consortium of investigators with extensive experience in conducting research of chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney disease in AIs of Southwestern US. Our proposed CRIC ancillary cohort study of 500 AIs (AI-CRIC) will rapidly improve our understanding of both potential risk factors for CKD progression, as well as the scope of this disease among AIs. This proposal leverages the current CRIC study and incorporates the planned activities of the next phase of the study – “CRIC 2018” – by implementing contemporary CRIC protocols for kidney and cardiovascular measurement and outcomes. The overall goal of the proposed prospective cohort study is to precisely assess the extent to which there are higher rates of CKD/CVD progression in AIs than in other racial/ethnic groups based on standardized definitions used throughout CRIC and relate CKD to the levels of potential environmental and occupational exposures unique to AIs residing in the American Southwest. To better understand the natural history of CKD/CVD in this high-risk population, AI-CRIC will implement the CRIC 2018 protocol of ambulatory monitoring of kidney function and damage along with evaluations of CVD sub-phenotypes using mobile health technologies. We will address these overarching goals with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Conduct a longitudinal study of a CKD cohort of southwest AIs to identify unique risk factors for CKD and CVD progression and compare CKD and CVD event rates and risk factors between AI and other populations represented in CRIC; Specific Aim 2: Conduct ambulatory monitoring of kidney function and damage, and evaluate its relationship with exposure data; Specific Aim 3: Conduct CVD sub-phenotyping using mobile health technologies and evaluate its relationship with exposures data. This proposal takes advantage of the ongoing data collection and expertise of the CRIC study to address a gap in our understanding of CKD progression among AI. Ultimately, AI-CRIC will rapidly inform our understanding of the burden of CKD and provide disparity-reducing interventions. Importantly, the AI-CRIC addresses both an overarching goal of Healthy People 2020 to increase equity and reduce disparities and a priority issue for the American Society of Nephrology.

"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations,9848452,R01MD014712,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Engineering ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Planning ', ' plan health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Joints ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Population Statistics ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Testing ', ' Urban Health ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Physical environment ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease registry ', ' model development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' beneficiary ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' combinatorial ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' population health ', ' data registry ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' health data ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,389501,0.13321987163881058
"Racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation. PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Kidney transplantation is the preferred modality of treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as it improves quality of life and survival for patients with ESRD. However, racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation are present in adults and children with chronic kidney disease. The lower access of black and Hispanic adults to kidney transplant has been ascribed to late referral for nephrology care, delayed referral for transplant evaluation, lower socioeconomic status, and differences in cultural beliefs or attitudes surrounding organ transplantation. However, the fact that similar racial and ethnic disparities are also present in children (who have better access to healthcare than adults, and for whom transplantation is the standard ESRD treatment modality) suggests that there may be additional barriers that contribute to these disparities. For example, some studies have suggested that chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses more rapidly in black and Hispanic patients, which could shorten the time available for transplant evaluation, waitlisting, and preemptive surgery during the advanced stages of CKD (prior to dialysis). In addition, since obesity is more prevalent in racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, and most transplant centers have body mass index criterion for transplantation and kidney donation, this policy may disproportionately disadvantage black or Hispanic recipients despite the absence of solid evidence that long-term allograft outcomes are worse in obese recipients. Donor perceptions regarding their own health, or transplant center's assessment of donor suitability, may also differ by donor race or ethnicity. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to evaluate disparities in transplant access in both adults and children within the context of medical risk factors (and policies surrounding these risk factors) that may disadvantage black or Hispanic patients, compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. In Aim 1, we propose to examine whether there are differences in the time spent in the advanced stages of CKD (stage 4 or 5) by race or ethnicity (when evaluation for waitlisting or transplantation typically occurs) using individual level data from four national CKD cohorts. In Aim 2, we propose to evaluate how body mass index may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in access to transplantation or suitability for kidney donation using data from the United States Renal Data System (recipients) and University of California San Francisco [UCSF] (donors). In Aim 3, we propose to establish a prospective study of potential living kidney donors to compare donor perceptions of their health with objective measures of donor risk and the transplant center's perception of donor suitability by race and ethnicity. UCSF is well-suited for the conduct of this proposal, given that it is one of the largest transplant centers in the US, performing 300-350 kidney transplants (including about 150 living donor transplants) annually. Our study will inform whether policy changes are needed to improve parity in access to kidney transplantation and will facilitate the design of additional strategies to enhance organ donation among racial and ethnic minorities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black and Hispanic patients with kidney disease have lower access to kidney transplantation compared to non- Hispanic white patients.

"Intensive Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (iPREP RRT) PROJECT ABSTRACT African Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience disparities in the quality of their medical care, self-care and preparation for end stage renal disease (ESRD). Patient education can help African-American patients with advanced CKD decide to engage in self-care to delay progression to ESRD and about renal replacement therapy (RRT) treatment options. Hospitalization represents a “missed opportunity” to provide CKD education and ESRD planning to help patients make informed choices about their care that align with their preferences. Many patients are hospitalized within three months of dialysis initiation. The hospital also captures patients who are not otherwise well-linked to the medical system. In prior work our team developed and implemented PREP RRT, a culturally-tailored, multi-modality patient education intervention for hospitalized African American patients with advanced CKD using a racially concordant in-person educator and literacy- sensitive education materials. Our intervention was feasible and effective in increasing patient knowledge but was not intensive enough to change behavior. Thus, we used adapted an 12- week effective outpatient patient education program to complement our in-patient pilot program to increase patient knowledge, improve self- care behavior and strengthen linkage to care. In this proposal, we will conduct a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of the intensive PREP RRT intervention for hospitalized African American patients with advanced CKD with both a hospital-based intervention and a 12 week community-based intervention. We seek to increase patient knowledge, self-efficacy, self-management behavior, health seeking behavior, RRT planning and blood pressure control. We have assembled a strong team with skills in CKD health disparities, hospital- based and community-based interventions, randomized trial design, culturally-tailored patient-education, and theory-based intervention development. After successful completion of our aims, we will have developed an effective intervention that will reduce disparities by improving patient's CKD- related knowledge, behavior and care. We will also have the ability to disseminate the intervention across settings and to adapt the intervention for other patient populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient education can help African-American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) to make informed decisions to engage in self-care to delay progression to ESKD and about ESKD treatment options.

"Leveraging ancestry to map kidney loci ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease is a progressive and heterogeneous condition that affects 10% of individuals worldwide, and a cause of premature cardiovascular disease and death. Little is known about the mechanisms leading to its development and predisposition. Despite the strong evidence for a role of ancestry in chronic kidney disease susceptibility, few studies have leveraged ancestry for gene discovery. Hispanics are an understudied minority group that is comprised of many overlapping ancestral groups (Amerindian, West African, European). Hispanics have a high prevalence of increased albuminuria and end-stage renal disease, which has been associated with their Amerindian ancestry. We propose to identify ancestry-specific loci, and their corresponding rare and common genetic variants, that explain the higher susceptibility for chronic kidney disease in Hispanics. We will use novel admixture mapping approaches to map genomic segments and variants inherited from the ancestral population with the higher disease variant frequency (Aim 1), followed by fine-mapping and validation of associations in ancestry-specific cohorts (Hispanics, American Indians, European and West Africa ancestries) (Aim 2). We will leverage data from the large population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos for gene discovery, and propose to fine-map Amerindian loci using a combination of genotyping and targeted sequencing. To gain insights into the functional roles of identified genes, we will prioritize variants for experiments using in vitro and mouse model systems for transgenic and gene targeting studies (Aim 3). This proposal leverages ancestry to identify loci for kidney traits in Hispanics, and uniquely complement large ongoing genome wide association approaches. Our results will provide clues to racial/ethnic disparities in disease risk, and improve understanding of the biological pathways leading to chronic kidney disease. Ultimately this research could inform personalized medicine and improve public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study proposes to identify genetic variants that explain ethnic variation in chronic kidney disease susceptibility in Hispanic/Latinos and American Indians, two understudied populations for genetic risk of chronic kidney disease. Findings from this study may have a broad impact on informing ethnic disparities in disease risk, could inform personalized medicine and improve public health of U.S. minority population.

"APOL1 Nephropathy: Linking Genetics and Mechanisms SUMMARY African Americans develop kidney failure at rates 4-5 fold higher than European Americans. Coding variants in the APOL1 gene, found only in people of recent African ancestry, drive a large fraction of this risk disparity. We have named these APOL1 variants G1 (S342G and I384M) and G2 (del388N389Y). Risk inheritance is recessive: only individuals carrying two variant APOL1 alleles have a markedly increased risk of kidney disease. In the U.S. approximately 13% of African Americans, or about 4,000,000 people, have a high-risk genotype. Most recessive diseases are caused by loss-of- function mutation. Surprisingly, there is data from model systems in kidney cells, mice, drosophila, and yeast that support the idea that the APOL1 risk variants (RV) are actually gain-of-function mutations that cause toxicity when expressed at high levels. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanism of APOL1 kidney disease such that two RVs are required, providing insight into this fundamental question of recessive, gain-of-function toxicity. We propose that the G0, or wild- type, APOL1 allele can alter the behavior of the risk variants and thus prevent their toxicity. In AIM 1, we will use isogenic, Crispr-engineered APOL1 BAC transgenic mice to determine the differing properties of G0 and risk-variant APOL1 in the full complexity of the glomerulus. We will test the effects of different APOL1 variants singly and in combination in order to answer questions about gene dosage, WT rescue of risk-variant toxicity, and possible differences in mechanism of action between the two major APOL1 risk alleles (G1 and G2). In AIM 2, our goal is to understand APOL1 targeting to lipid droplets. We have observed that lipid droplets (LDs) show prominent G0 but little or no G1 or G2 localization in cell systems and that co-expression of G0 facilitates the movement of G1 or G2 onto lipid droplets. We will use imaging and biochemical analyses to examine determinates of APOL1 localization to LDs, determine if there are differences in the binding of APOL1 to other LD-associated proteins, and define the cellular consequence(s) of altered APOL1 risk variant targeting to the LD. We will test the relevance of these experiments with in vivo studies. In AIM 3, we will determine the role of aggregation in APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity. We have observed that the APOL1 RVs have much stronger propensity than G0 to aggregate. Our data indicate that RV aggregation occurs in mitochondria. We hypothesize that aggregation is a key element in RV toxicity, and that G0 can interfere with RV aggregation. In cell-based systems we will characterize the APOL1 aggregates, determine whether aggregation is essential for APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity, understand the effect of aggregates on mitochondrial function, and test whether G0 can reverse RV aggregation and cytotoxicity. In vitro results will be validated in kidney organoids, a mouse model, and in human tissues. 8. Project Narrative Genetic variants in a single gene, APOL1, account for the very high rate of kidney disease in African Americans, and also confer resistance to Sleeping Sickness in Africa. We want to understand precisely how these genetic variants lead to this major disparity in kidney disease at a biological level. Understanding how these differences in the APOL1 gene cause kidney disease in African Americans will have direct implications for improving all aspects of care for the growing number people with this serious public health problem and ultimately removing a major racial health disparity.",APOL1 Nephropathy: Linking Genetics and Mechanisms,9861571,R01MD014726,"['Africa ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Elements ', ' Endoplasmic Reticulum ', ' Ergastoplasm ', ' Engineering ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterozygote ', ' heterozygosity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Organoids ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Proteins ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' African Trypanosomiasis ', ' African Sleeping Sickness ', ' sleeping sickness ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Gene Copy Number ', ' Gene Dosage ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' cytotoxicity test ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Pedicel ', ' Foot Process ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' human tissue ', ' System ', ' Renal Cell ', ' kidney cell ', ' American ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' trafficking ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' genetic recessive ', ' recessive trait ', ' recessive genetic trait ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' BAC clone ', ' BACs ', ' Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Mitochondrial Matrix ', ' Affinity ', ' cytotoxic ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Seminal ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' gain of function mutation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' endophenotype ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' loss of function ', ' gain of function ', ' high risk ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMHD,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,478239,0.09313467720671423
"Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to transplant are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the transplant process. In 2014, our SEKTx Coalition conducted a randomized, multicomponent intervention (Reducing Disparities In Access to kidNey Transplantation [RaDIANT]) Community Study in GA, the state with the lowest kidney transplant rates in the nation, consisting of patient- and provider-focused educational and engagement interventions designed to increase referral for transplant evaluation among AA ESRD patients. This study was effective in improving referral for kidney transplantation among AA in GA, but efforts to improve access to kidney transplantation must be expanded beyond GA and should include interventions targeting steps beyond referral to the medical evaluation at the transplant center. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to eliminate racial disparities in every step of the kidney transplant process. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine reasons for racial disparities in medical evaluation for kidney transplantation among dialysis patients in GA, NC and SC. Specific Aim 2: Implement the RaDIANT Regional Study in GA, NC, and SC with the goal of increasing rates of referral, medical evaluation, and waitlisting, and reducing disparities in these key steps. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a process and outcome evaluation of the RaDIANT Regional Study interventions. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant access among the AA ESRD population in the Southeast and reduce health disparities in transplantation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of kidney disease is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. The proposed study seeks to leverage an existing academic-community collaboration with the Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention targeting End Stage Renal Disease patients and dialysis facility staff in reducing racial disparities in access t kidney transplantation.",Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Kidney Transplantation: the RaDIANT Regional Study,9831063,U01MD010611,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Maintenance ', ' North Carolina ', ' parity ', ' Patient advocacy ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Facility Controls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Living Donors ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Population Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' quality improvement organization ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' volunteer ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' surveillance data ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' intervention cost ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' transplant centers ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,497016,0.13970851774364518
"Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media Summary Over 90,000 individuals in the United States await kidney transplantation. Only about 12,000 will receive a deceased donor transplant each year, and recent efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, most candidates on the waiting list have a higher chance of dying than of being offered a deceased donor kidney. Live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) eliminates the wait and offers superior survival, but accounts for fewer than 6,000 additional transplants per year despite a huge potential pool of millions of adults living in the US. Worse, LDKT rates are lowest among Hispanic and African American candidates who account for over 30% of the waitlist. Regardless of race, known barriers to identifying a live donor include lack of education, reluctance to discuss one's illness, and hesitance to ask others to donate. We have developed two novel interventions to address these barriers. The first is a 6-month training program that combines education, advocacy, and instrumental support by pairing candidates with a live donor champion (LDC): a friend, family member, or community member trained to spread awareness of ESRD, LDKT, and the candidate's story throughout their social network. The second is a less-intensive Facebook (FB) app (designed in collaboration with FB leadership) that leverages the broad reach of social media to spread awareness, facilitating FB posts about the candidate's story, providing links to education about ESRD and LDKT, and documenting the candidate's search for a donor through a ""chronically viral"" Facebook story. In pilot studies at our center, participants of both interventions were significantly more likely to undergo LDKT compared to matched controls. While encouraging, pilot testing has been non-randomized and limited to our center and its unique patient population. Furthermore, it remains unclear how intense an intervention is necessary, i.e. the less-intense FB approach or the more-intense champion approach. To assess the real- world effectiveness of the LDC program and/or the Facebook app in expanding live donation among a heterogeneous population of waitlist candidates, we now propose to test these interventions at three busy transplant centers that serve a heterogeneous group of largely underserved patients. The relative dearth of deceased donors has caused a profound organ shortage; it is essential to turn to novel efforts that increase live donation. Development and widespread implementation of culturally competent LDC and Facebook App interventions has the potential to increase the overall incidence of LDKT while also addressing disparities in access to LDKT.   Public Health Relevance There is a crisis in the United States with over 100,000 people on the transplant waitlist. Efforts to increase deceased donation have been largely unsuccessful so we must now turn to living donation to confront the shortage. Barriers to increasing living donation are largely due to communication, thus we look to novel interventions using social media and social networks to address the problem. Pilot programs with these interventions have proven successful at our center and we now wish to test dissemination to other centers, especially those caring for some of our most underserved patients.",Expanding live donor kidney transplantation through advocacy training and social media,9912138,R01DK111966,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Awareness ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Leadership ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Friends ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Organ ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' UNOS ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' social media ', ' transplant centers ', ' Facebook ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,627306,0.14033710212403408
"Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation Project Summary  End stage renal disease (ESRD) is among the ten leading causes of death for Americans, and its incidence and prevalence are rising, especially among non-White groups. Kidney transplantation is the most effective treatment option for many Americans, but the number of Americans needing kidneys is currently much larger and rising much faster than current transplant levels. Patients who seek transplants have one of two options: wait for a kidney from a deceased donor to become available, or obtain a transplant from a living kidney donor. Deceased donor kidney transplant levels are projected to grow little over time, constrained by population aging and mortality patterns, but living donation donor kidney transplantation (LDD KT) holds the prospect of substantial growth if healthy population members are willing and able to donate. Unfortunately, there are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in LDD KT rates that compound disparities in rates of ESRD. Prior research hypothesizes that differential access to healthy, compatible donors in candidates' social networks may explain racial disparities in usage of LDD KT. However, a limitation of this work is that it focuses on those who are evaluated for donation, not the many members of transplant candidates' social networks who could be evaluated for donation, but are not. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT. Based on qualitative interviews and a pilot survey of 72 transplant candidates we previously collected in a large transplant center, we suspect that the differential access hypothesis does not hold, and that there are promising points of social intervention for researchers to reduce racial disparities in LDD KT. These pilot data show large LDD KT underutilization for all candidates, and that Black candidates have access to promising living donors at higher rates than White candidates. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the primary barrier to eliminating disparities in LDD KT and promoting greater utilization of LDD KT for all groups is social, not biomedical, in origin. In this proposal, we will extend our prior work to develop and test evidence based, randomized social network interventions that will target social barriers to LDD KT and follow up with candidate medical records to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. Specifically, we will compare a control group of candidates to those assigned to two treatments that we will pilot and test: a) a search intervention where a subset of candidates is coached to approach promising family members that seem to be underutilized based on our pilot data, and b) a rhetorical intervention where we encourage a subset of candidates to use scripts for discussing transplantation with family members that we find to be effective in survey vignette experiments and focus groups. With eighteen month medical records follow up of all candidates and the large amount of data we will obtain on their social networks, we will assess the social barriers that lead to underutilization of LDD KT, how those factors vary by race, and how they can be reduced through promising social network interventions. LDD KT has substantial potential to solve public health challenges around the growing prevalence of ESRD, and the basic and applied knowledge that we will develop as part of this proposal will help to unlock this potential.   Project Narrative  This project will evaluate underutilization of living donor donation kidney transplantation (LDD KT) at two large kidney transplant centers and develop and test evidence based, randomized interventions to increase LDD KT and reduce racial disparities in its use. LDD KT is the most promising treatment option to meet the challenges of a rising population of Americans with end stage renal disease (ESRD), but LDD KT rates are not increasing and racial disparities in the use of LDD KT are widening. Prior research has documented that non-white transplant candidates are less likely than white candidates to have family or friends evaluated for LDD KT, and that those evaluated for donation to non-white candidates are less likely to be deemed healthy and compatible enough to donate than those evaluated for white candidates, but it has not examined the full family and social networks in which candidates are embedded in order to determine whether limited access to healthy, compatible donors drives underutilization and racial disparities or whether other social barriers are in operation. This neglect is unfortunate because there are many non-medical interventions that could be tested to increase rates of LDD KT by giving candidates more information about what types of family members to approach and how to approach them. Prior qualitative and quantitative pilot work we have conducted suggests that some of the largest barriers arise from decisions candidates make about which family members to ask for kidney transplants, and whether family members volunteer to be evaluated upon hearing of a candidate's diagnosis. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social network interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT, which we will evaluate with longitudinal medical records follow up. In the first year and a half of the project, we will build on prior qualitative, quantitative, and experimental pilot data we have collected to develop and refine two separate interventions in focus groups and survey vignette experiments. In years two through four, we will survey transplant candidates at two large transplant centers about their family and social networks, with special attention to candidate perceptions of their network members' health and willingness and ability to donate. During this time, we will also survey candidate network members using effective referral based survey strategies in order to obtain additional information on the barriers to donation among family and close social network members of kidney transplant candidates. We will assign each surveyed candidate to one of three experimental arms that encompass the interventions developed during the first year and a half of the project: a control group, a group that we coach on which of their network members to approach, and a group that we coach on how to approach their network members. In years four and five of the project, we will follow up on the candidates, examining whether they had a potential donor evaluated, who that donor was, and whether they were able to obtain a living donor transplant. The results of this project will contribute to basic and applied knowledge about social barriers to access in LDD KT, and quantify the efficacy of promising social network approaches for promoting greater utilization of LDD KT and reducing racial disparities therein.  ",Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation,9920706,R01DK114888,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Donor person ', ' transplant donor ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hearing ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Kinship Networks ', ' Respondent ', ' Organ Donations ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' tool ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' neglect ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' volunteer ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' transplant centers ', ' experimental arm ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' live kidney donor ', ' living kidney donor ', ' social interventions ', ' ']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,235208,0.11358149906998188
"Identifying and exploring solutions to the ethical challenges of ApoL1 testing of donors with recent African ancestry through mixed methods research with stakeholders PROJECT SUMMARY Blacks in the United States have a higher incidence of end-stage kidney disease than the general population; much, but not all, of this excess risk is attributed to variants in the ApoL1 gene. The ApoL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes (APOLLO) Network was established to address the role, if any, of ApoL1 testing in kidney transplantation. The APOLLO Network will enroll and genotype approximately 700 LD and 1600 DD while tracking outcomes for LD and recipients. All participants will have the option to receive their ApoL1 test results after enrollment ends. The APOLLO Network has the potential to increase understanding of kidney health disparities among Blacks and improve transplantation outcomes. However, the introduction of ApoL1 testing risks stigmatizing Black organ donors, reducing the number of Black LD, and worsening disparities. It also raises a series of ethical questions about clinical practices: who to test, how to use test results, and with whom to share results. We propose a 3-year ancillary R01 project that will be relevant not only to the APOLLO Network, but to future projects involving genetic testing that targets Black patients. Our team members serve on the APOLLO steering committee and community advisory council and have engaged diverse stakeholders in developing the following aims and research questions (RQ): Aim 1. Answer RQ1: Which factors influence participants' evaluation of competing ApoL1 testing clinical practices and engagement with ApoL1 test results? a. Administer a web-based survey to APOLLO participants that assesses the acceptability of competing ApoL1 clinical practices. b. Determine factors that predict APOLLO participants' attitudes toward diverse ApoL1 clinical policies, and whether participants access their ApoL1 test results. Aim 2. Answer RQ2: What are participant experiences with the return of ApoL1 testing results? a. Administer a survey to 600 participants who access their ApoL1 test results to assess comprehension of information, satisfaction or regret with testing, and intentions to use this information. b. Conduct qualitative interviews to explore the reasons behind participants' decision whether to receive ApoL1 test results, and examine the impact of these decisions on participants and family members. Aim 3. Answer RQ3: Is it feasible to use a Delphi panel process to obtain an informed consensus among diverse stakeholder groups on ApoL1 testing clinical practices? a. We will use a Delphi panel process with representation from all DD family members, DD recipients, LD, LD recipients, and transplant personnel. Project Narrative Blacks in the United States have a higher incidence of end-stage kidney disease than the general population; much, but not all, of this excess risk is attributed to variants in the ApoL1 gene. We will conduct surveys and interviews with individuals who are undergoing ApoL1 testing in the context of a larger organ transplantation research study (APOLLO) in order to explore ethical and social issues. We will work with a diverse panel of stakeholders to establish a consensus on key clinical practices surrounding ApoL1 testing in the context of organ transplantation.",Identifying and exploring solutions to the ethical challenges of ApoL1 testing of donors with recent African ancestry through mixed methods research with stakeholders,9986903,R01MD014161,"['Attitude ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Survey ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Regrets ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' RQ2 ', ' Comprehension ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' instrument ', ' Living Donors ', ' Consensus ', ' Test Result ', ' Allografting ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Organ Transplant Research ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' organ allocation ', ' data sharing ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' genetic counselor ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' recruit ', ' transplant centers ', ' cognitive interview ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' genetic testing ', ' ']",NIMHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,400008,0.12456444997403834
"OPTIMIZing  carE in Chronic Kidney Disease (OPTIMIZE CKD) Revised Abstract R18 DK118460-01: OPTIMIZing carE in Chronic Kidney Disease (OPTIMIZE CKD) Millions of adults have chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to substantial morbidity, mortality and health care costs. These effects are concentrated in patients with high-risk disease. Several provider- and system-level barriers lead to well-described gaps in care for these patients, contributing to poor outcomes. Population health management (PHM) improves health by aggregating and analyzing data across a population to drive consistent, evidence-based care. CKD PHM using electronic health records (EHRs) can be a sustainable strategy to overcome physician- and system-level barriers. EHR-based PHM could improve the identification of patients with high-risk CKD; increase the use of evidence-based, widely available, and cost-effective interventions; and enhance medication safety. The Kidney- Coordinated HeAlth Management Partnership (Kidney-CHAMP) study (R01DK116957-01A1) is testing the effectiveness of a multi-faceted EHR-based PHM intervention to improve the delivery of evidence-based CKD care in high-risk patients. Specifically, it targets: 1) timely communication of high-risk CKD, 2) implementation of remote nephrology guidance (E-consult) to improve evidence-based CKD care, 3) provision of pharmacist-led medication safety reviews, and 4) standardized CKD patient education. This 42-month pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial in ~1,700 high risk CKD patients from 330 Primary care physicians (PCPs) will evaluate the intervention’s effects on key processes of care and kidney disease progression.   The proposed ancillary study to Kidney-CHAMP will qualitatively identify barriers/facilitators of the intervention’s effectiveness and response heterogeneity in diverse settings and with diverse patient and provider groups.  Participants will be selected using purposive sampling from the PCPs and patients who are randomized to the intervention arm in Kidney-CHAMP study. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to elicit key physician and patient level predictors that underlie effectiveness of the intervention in diverse settings, which will allow refinements of CKD phenotypes and transportability of the intervention in heterogeneous populations. These deliverables would strengthen future trials and specifically address disparity in CKD care by interviewing patients from vulnerable groups including minorities, low socioeconomic status, and those with multi-morbidity. This ancillary study is highly complementary and valuable to the evaluation of the Kidney-CHAMP intervention. The proposed qualitative work will further refine future efforts to improve the intervention’s implementation, dissemination and use in real practice and diverse healthcare settings. CKD is associated with an unacceptably high human and financial cost. Gaps in CKD care contribute to catastrophic outcomes such as dialysis dependence. Novel system-based interventions are needed to improve CKD care. Real time risk stratification and population health management using electronic health records can improve CKD care and outcomes in the patients who need it most.",OPTIMIZing  carE in Chronic Kidney Disease (OPTIMIZE CKD),9995019,R18DK118460,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Communication ', ' Financial cost ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' intervention effect ', ' population health ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Risk stratification ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' service engagement ', ' provider barriers ', ' provider-level barriers ', ' system-level barriers ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' practice setting ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' medication safety ', ' data centers ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R18,2020,112626,0.16385474688637156
"Cleveland Precision Medicine Chronic Kidney Disease Cohort Project Abstract Although hypertension is associated with ~25% of end-stage renal disease (H-ESRD) in the United States, the pathogenic mechanisms that drive the initiation and progression of hypertension-associated chronic kidney disease (HTN-CKD) are unclear. The incidence of H-ESRD is 4- to 5-fold greater in African American populations than in whites. To address this health disparity, the Cleveland KPMP Recruiting Network will recruit a cohort of CKD patients with HTN-CKD. Prospective participants with CKD stage 3a will be identified by automated, scheduled queries of the electronic health records (EHR) of two large health care delivery systems in Cleveland, OH, the Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth. Eligible candidates will be enriched for subjects likely to progress by using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation to identify individuals with > 15% probability of developing ESRD in 5 years. This Network plans enrollment of 10 participants each year during the two year UG3 exploratory phase and 40 to 50 subjects each year for the subsequent, three year UH3 implementation phase. Once kidney research biopsy safety is established in UG3, HTN-CKD subject inclusion criteria in UH3 will be modified to include proteinuric CKD Stage 2 patients. Subjects with other CKD phenotypes can be recruited to support consortium goals. After informed consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a baseline MRI to image kidney structure and a research kidney biopsy and then be followed every 6 months at standard of care visits for the duration of the KPMP. Baseline and longitudinal biosamples will be collected and linked through REDCap to clinical data in the EHRs. The Network plans to obtain additional healthy and disease kidney samples from living donor kidney implant biopsies and an additional tissue core obtained at an indication biopsy from HTN-CKD patients, respectively. Clinical data, biopsy blocks and biosamples will be submitted to Central Hub repositories. The Network includes a Community Partnership Committee composed of CKD patients and families, physicians and an ethicist to guide implementation of this KPMP Network. In anticipation of Opportunity Pool funding, the PIs have recruited co-investigators, who will utilize the rich KPMP molecular, radiologic and histopathologic phenotypes and longitudinal clinical data for discovery. Since excess risk in African Americans for HTN-CKD is largely explained by genetic variations in APOL1, our initial research goal in UH3 is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this association. We will integrate molecular and clinical phenotypes with visual and subvisual morphologic descriptors to discover the cells and associated molecular pathways mediating APOL1-associated HTN-CKD. In pilot, proof- of-principle studies, we used computational methods and identified a set of sub-visual morphologic features that discriminated 10 African American kidney transplant implant biopsies with high risk APOL1 genotypes from 6 implant biopsies with low risk APOL1 genotypes. Creative strategies that integrate KPMP datasets will define other research questions to identify biologic pathways driving CKD and result in new CKD therapies. Project Narrative Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) affect over 20 million Americans, but their causes are poorly understood and CKD often worsens despite treatment. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) will recruit adults from around the United States for a research kidney biopsy and long term follow-up in order to discover causes of CKD and improve outcomes and care of CKD patients. The Cleveland KPMP Recruiting Network will enroll individuals with mild to moderate kidney injury attributed to high blood pressure and collect their kidney tissue; blood, urine and stool samples; and de-identified health information. Working with KPMP scientists, together we will improve diagnosis and treatment of CKD in order to stop or reverse kidney damage, which often results in death or need for dialysis for CKD
