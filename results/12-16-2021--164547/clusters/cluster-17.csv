"Morehouse School of Medicine Center of Excellence The Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) is a historically black institution founded in 1975 to recruit and train minority and other students as physicians, biomedical scientists and public health professionals committed to the primary health care needs of the underserved. In its comparatively brief history MSM as s private medical school of small size has already distinguished itself as a leader in medical education with particular success in training minority physicians and scientists. As MSM has matured in its development and moves into the 21' century, it is prepared to provide the same dedication to excellence and leadership in research focused on health disparities ravaging minority populations as it has manifested in the areas of clinical care and education. The overall research goal of the institution's strategic plan is to maintain and strengthen a high quality research environment that fosters conducting research on diseases that disproportionately affect underserved populations. Although MSM has established a relatively robust research infrastructure for an institution of its size and age, it is anticipated that these assets will depreciate and/or become obsolete over time. A research endowment award will allow MSM and other such minority- serving institutions to establish mechanisms by which they can began building endowments and attracting private sources rather than a near total reliance on federal funding. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to retain existing preeminent scholars by providing a perpetual resource for support of discrete areas of investigation; 2) to recruit ""magnet"" investigators) who are capable of serving as Directors of research programs focused on health disparities, particularly cancer research; 3) to maintain and enhance the growth and vitality of the research enterprise by securing a continuous source of funds that will provide resources necessary to support the research infrastructure and 4) to provide support toward developing graduate programs (Ph.D. and MPH) of the highest quality that will complement MSM's various foci of research.

"Morehouse School of Medicine Center for Excellence Rese*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morehouse School of Medicine's (MSM) long range goal for the COE Research Endowment is to utilize the support in two key ways: (1) to enhance the research infrastructure to the level of increased capacity and research competitiveness presently accorded to research intensive academic institutions and (2) to leverage these funds, over time, to acquire additional extramural and private support. To achieve these goals, MSM proposes to use the requested funds to strengthen research capacity in cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, mental health, to support the research endeavors of students and faculty in graduate training programs and to assist in the recruitment and retention of minority scientists in the aforementioned research areas. In just two decades, MSM has established a basic framework for a robust research enterprise as noted by the creation of the Neuroscience Institute, the Cardiovascular Research Institute, the Clinical Research Center, and the National Center for Primary Care and the Prevention Research Center. In addition to these institutes and centers, MSM has established programs in space medicine, a cooperative reproductive science research center, and implemented plans for a stroke center as well as a comprehensive center on health disparities that will capture and unify research aimed at eliminating gaps in health status. These ongoing research efforts are occurring in a dynamic and exciting arena of class size expansion, the development of a new graduate program focused on clinical research that supplements the existing graduate programs and the progressive developments in the medical education, public health and biomedical science programs. The specific aims for this proposal are: (1) to recruit and retain eminent scholars and mid-level investigators using endowment funds as a continuous source of support, (2) to expand and strengthen capacity building with the enhancement of new and existent research areas, and (3) to support research focused graduate programs leading to the MPH, PhD and MS in clinical research.

"THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ELIMINATING DISPARITIES I*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) proposes to develop a Center of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach on Health Disparities and Training using a Three Dimensional Approach. The 3-D approach integrates the dynamic components of measured outcomes, determinants and research strategies toward eliminating the disparities in health among different racial and ethnic groups. The MSM proposal builds on the institutional mission, its accomplishments and its unique community environment. MSM has always been committed to the recruitment and education/training of underrepresented minorities for public health professionals, biomedical science careers and primary care providers for underserved communities. Its track record has been outstanding and its work has been recognized by awards from local and national organizations including the American Association of Medical Colleges. Located in southwest Atlanta, with in the Atlanta University Center (AUC)-the largest center historically dedicated to the education of African American students-MSM is ideally situated to develop relevant community partnerships. Based on the opportunity to develop new partnerships, MSM proposes to build on shared concerns about disparities in health to launch additional community partnerships for research and training in eliminating disparities. In time, its partners will include the four undergraduate/graduate colleges of the AUC, a network of concerned Black churches, a southeast network (eight states) of clinicians at community health centers, a community college system, and Emory University Schools of Medicine and Public Health. Other external partnerships (e.g., business and industry) will also be developed. There are four goals for the overall proposal: 1) to educate, motivate and mobilize the community partnerships, 2) to develop the infrastructure within the partnerships to launch the 3-D approach, 3) to develop, expand and conduct multi-disciplinary research to eliminate disparities, and 4) to implement and evaluate strategies/programs to eliminate disparities in health. For each goal there are well-defined and measurable objectives. Developmental and pilot research projects in areas of disparities in cancer, cvd-stroke, maternal and child health, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and mental health are described-each building on existing work in these areas where possible, and each taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the new and expanded partnerships.         ",THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ELIMINATING DISPARITIES I*,6605235,P20MD000272,"['health care quality ', ' health care service availability ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P20,2002,1500000,0.07005290449554527

"Couples HIV Counseling & Testing in two African capitals  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sub-Saharan Africa has over 80% of the world's HIV infections, and an estimated 70% of prevalent and incident infections in African cities are the result of transmission between married partners. Our research team has 15 years' experience conducting heterosexual HIV prevention research in the capitals of two African countries: Kigali, Rwanda (1986-) and Lusaka, Zambia (1994-). Our early studies in Rwanda showed that Voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT) results in pronounced risk reduction in married couples. Since we first published these findings in 1991, we have provided VCT to over 20,000 Rwandan and Zambian couples. In the last year we have implemented 'same-day' couples' VCT in antenatal care clinics in order to combine prevention of mother-to-child transmission and heterosexual HIV transmission. Couples' VCT is the only prevention program proven to reduce HIV incidence in the largest risk group in the world, African couples. It is also feasible, cost-effective, and popular with clients. In spite of this, in 2002, twenty years after the start of the HIV epidemic, ten years after the first publication about couples' VCT in Africa, and three years after the discovery of inexpensive regimens for perinatal HIV prevention, VCT has been provided to < 1% of African couples. A number of structural factors affect demand for and supply of couples' VCT. Demand for couples' VCT is low, because of the belief that monogamy is 'safe', the fear of stigma, gender inequity between husband and wife, and lack of knowledge about where VCT can be obtained. Given the low demand, policymakers and other influential groups have not promoted couples' VCT. In turn, funding agencies have not supported VCT services, further compromising supply and ensuring low utilization. Given what we know about the beneficial impact of couples' VCT, it is critical that this continuing cycle of low demand-low supply be interrupted. We propose three linked activities in each of two capital cities in Africa: a) a quasi-experimental three armed study of community based interventions to increase couples' Voluntary HIV testing and counseling (specific aims 3 and 4); b) follow-up behavioral assessments of structural factors in HIV discordant couples, with the goal of improving couple counseling strategies (specific aim 5); and c) systematic inclusion of community influence networks, policymakers, and funding agencies in the development and implementation of the interventions, a process that will culminate in a plan and commitment for sustainability and dissemination of couples' VCT (specific aims 1, 2, and 6).

Located in southwest Atlanta, with in the Atlanta University Center (AUC)-the largest center historically dedicated to the education of African American students-MSM is ideally situated to develop relevant community partnerships. Based on the opportunity to develop new partnerships, MSM proposes to build on shared concerns about disparities in health to launch additional community partnerships for research and training in eliminating disparities. In time, its partners will include the four undergraduate/graduate colleges of the AUC, a network of concerned Black churches, a southeast network (eight states) of clinicians at community health centers, a community college system, and Emory University Schools of Medicine and Public Health. Other external partnerships (e.g., business and industry) will also be developed. There are four goals for the overall proposal: 1) to educate, motivate and mobilize the community partnerships, 2) to develop the infrastructure within the partnerships to launch the 3-D approach, 3) to develop, expand and conduct multi-disciplinary research to eliminate disparities, and 4) to implement and evaluate strategies/programs to eliminate disparities in health. For each goal there are well-defined and measurable objectives. Developmental and pilot research projects in areas of disparities in cancer, cvd-stroke, maternal and child health, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and mental health are described-each building on existing work in these areas where possible, and each taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the new and expanded partnerships.         ",THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ELIMINATING DISPARITIES I*,6796297,P20MD000272,"['health care quality ', ' health care service availability ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P20,2004,1500000,0.07005290449554527
"HIV Prevention, Cost-Utility Analysis and Race/Ethnicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Since 1990, HIV incidence in the U.S. has been approximately constant at 40,000 infections per year. However, the communities most heavily impacted by HIV and AIDS have changed. African-American persons comprised 25.5% of AIDS cases from 1981 to 1987, but 44.9% during 1996 to 2000. Latino communities increased from 14.0% to 19.7% of AIDS cases during the same time frames, and White, non-Hispanic persons fraction of AIDS cases dropped from 59.7% to 34.0% during those time periods. Asian/Pacific Islander and Native American/American Indian/Alaskan Native proportions of AIDS cases stayed under 1% in both time frames. Despite these clear disparities, HIV prevention behavioral intervention research has seen a lag in the development of interventions for racial/ethnic minority communities. Further, in the entire literature on the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions, only two economic evaluation studies have been conducted on interventions designed specifically for racial/ethnic minority communities. Policymakers who allocate HIV prevention service funds must know about the costs and consequences of various types of HIV prevention interventions in order to make sound decisions about how to use available resources so as to maximize the number of HIV infections in various communities. Although both of these studies followed general methodological recommendations for conducting cost-effectiveness analyses, these recommendations are not focused specifically for studies involving racial/ethnic minority communities. Therefore, more methodological work and more applications of such methods needs attention in the field of HIV prevention as focused on racial/ethnic minority communities disproportionately impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We propose to attend to some of these issues in this one-year project. The specific aims of the proposed project are as follows: To apply state-of-the-art cost-utility analysis methods (retrospectively) to two separate HIV prevention behavioral interventions for African American persons - one focused on gay and bisexual men, and one focused on women of undetermined HIV serostatus - so as to gauge the cost-effectiveness of these prevention services. In each of the two separate application studies, we will use the state-of-the-art methods to classify the HIV prevention behavioral intervention as either cost saving, cost-effective or cost inefficient. We hypothesize that each behavioral intervention will be cost saving relative to the comparison condition for that intervention. We will also use extensive sensitivity analyses to determine the extent to which parameters that may be influenced by cultural and/or societal factors related to race/ethnicity might influence the cost-utility analytic results and report fully on these sensitivity analyses. We propose to publish the findings in scientific journals and summarize the findings in a rigorous yet succinct manner for HIV prevention priority setters.

"An HIV/AIDS prevention Intervention for Chilean women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  At present there are no specific HIV/AIDS prevention programs tailored to the needs of Chilean women, despite their unique vulnerability and the increasing numbers infected by HIV. Serious unmet HIV prevention needs, as well as gender inequalities and other barriers to HIV prevention for low-income Chilean women, were identified in the Prs dissertation (Cianelli, 2003). The proposed research builds on this prior work to develop and test an HIV prevention intervention specifically tailored for low-income Chilean women. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will be used. In Phase I, qualitative interviews will elicit 3erspectives on HIV prevention of men--who control many aspects of women's lives--and of community leadersention to compliment to the relevant attitudes of Chilean women already identified in the Pl's dissertation research. A new HIV intervention tailored for low-income Chilean women, Mano a Mano (Hand to Hand) will be developed integrating the insights of Chilean women, community leaders and men with two existing HIV prevention interventions shown to be effective in other contexts. A pilot test will be conducted to assess the intervention's acceptability and feasibility. Phase II will assess the effectiveness of the Mano a Mano intervention in increasing HIV prevention behaviors for Chilean women. The intervention should improve participants' knowledge, attitudes, and HIV prevention behaviors. A quasi-experimental design with a comparable control group will be used with assessments made at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and follow up at 6 weeks and 3-months. A sample of 500 women (250 in the intervention group and 250 in the control group) will provide adequate power to test the research hypotheses. Because the intervention is low-cost and uses existing infrastructure, its transfer potential will be high. If the intervention is effective, it can be disseminated for low-income women throughout Chile.

"HIV Risk Reduction in Migrant Workers This proposed study targeting Alcohol and Other Drug-(AOD) using Migrant Workers (MWs) is a 5-year randomized trial of a Cognitive Behavioral HIV Prevention Intervention (CBI), enhanced/adapted (CBI-A) compared with a Health Promotion (HPC) condition. This application proposes to expand on current ""effective"" behavioral interventions to include contextual components (e.g., Peer Counseling and Motivational Enhancement) that are likely to produce long term maintenance of HIV risk reduction effects. The CBI-A integrates key contextual components targeting peer counseling and motivational interviewing linked to maintaining HIV risk reduction effects. Only two HIV prevention outcome studies of MWs, conducted by our research team, have assessed participants for longer than 6 months. Both studies used a CBI approach and documented a moderate short-term HIV risk reduction effect that diminished at the later follow-up points. The proposed sample (N=320) will be predominantly Hispanic and African-American, low income, sexually active, AOD-using MWs?a group disproportionately affected by HIV and other health disparities. We hypothesize that 1) the CBI-A will produce a greater beneficial effect than the HPC on HIV sexual risk behaviors of 'ratio of protected to unprotected sex following intervention' and frequency of unsafe sex; 2) that the CBI-A will produce more beneficial effects than the HPC in the mediator variables (social influence, stages of change, attitude-motivation-skills); and 3) that the CBI-A will be more effective for participants who are women, acculturated, have high levels of cognitive functioning and no history of traumatic abuse. Structural Equation Modeling analyses will be used to explore how study variables interrelate to affect outcomes. This project addresses the problem of health disparities in HIV risks and the potential to adapt ""effective"" interventions to reach this new population. The proposed project further responds to the NIH priority on rapidly translating and disseminating new knowledge, which emphasizes bringing intervention strategies developed during efficacy trials in a rigorous academic setting, into community settings in a manner adaptable to ""real world"" conditions. If successful, this research will delineate important HTV intervention strategies that can be practically implemented to improve maintenance of HIV risk behaviors of high-risk AOD-using MWs.

"Couples HIV Counseling & Testing in two African capitals  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sub-Saharan Africa has over 80% of the world's HIV infections, and an estimated 70% of prevalent and incident infections in African cities are the result of transmission between married partners. Our research team has 15 years' experience conducting heterosexual HIV prevention research in the capitals of two African countries: Kigali, Rwanda (1986-) and Lusaka, Zambia (1994-). Our early studies in Rwanda showed that Voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT) results in pronounced risk reduction in married couples. Since we first published these findings in 1991, we have provided VCT to over 20,000 Rwandan and Zambian couples. In the last year we have implemented 'same-day' couples' VCT in antenatal care clinics in order to combine prevention of mother-to-child transmission and heterosexual HIV transmission. Couples' VCT is the only prevention program proven to reduce HIV incidence in the largest risk group in the world, African couples. It is also feasible, cost-effective, and popular with clients. In spite of this, in 2002, twenty years after the start of the HIV epidemic, ten years after the first publication about couples' VCT in Africa, and three years after the discovery of inexpensive regimens for perinatal HIV prevention, VCT has been provided to < 1% of African couples. A number of structural factors affect demand for and supply of couples' VCT. Demand for couples' VCT is low, because of the belief that monogamy is 'safe', the fear of stigma, gender inequity between husband and wife, and lack of knowledge about where VCT can be obtained. Given the low demand, policymakers and other influential groups have not promoted couples' VCT. In turn, funding agencies have not supported VCT services, further compromising supply and ensuring low utilization. Given what we know about the beneficial impact of couples' VCT, it is critical that this continuing cycle of low demand-low supply be interrupted. We propose three linked activities in each of two capital cities in Africa: a) a quasi-experimental three armed study of community based interventions to increase couples' Voluntary HIV testing and counseling (specific aims 3 and 4); b) follow-up behavioral assessments of structural factors in HIV discordant couples, with the goal of improving couple counseling strategies (specific aim 5); and c) systematic inclusion of community influence networks, policymakers, and funding agencies in the development and implementation of the interventions, a process that will culminate in a plan and commitment for sustainability and dissemination of couples' VCT (specific aims 1, 2, and 6).

"Morehouse School of Medicine Training in Genomics and Hemoglobinopathies Program Hemoglobinopathies affect significant portions of the global population, mostly residing in countries with low incomes. The major goal of the Morehouse School of Medicine's Training in Genomics and Hemoglobinopathies Program (MSM TGHP) is to train outstanding researchers in this discipline while promoting the participation of trainees from underrepresented US minority populations, particularly those affected by hemoglobinopathies. The program will recruit and train 4 postdoctoral fellows over three years.  This program will be conducted in collaboration with the excellent MSM Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences and the Master of Clinical Research programs. The program covers travel, living and research expenses for trainees.  Collaborators from University of Ghana Medical School in Accra, Ghana, Emory University and Medical College of Georgia will be included in this program. Once trainees arrive at MSM, they will engage in a research project guided by an MSM mentor, assisted by the directors of the program and program faculty.  Didactic training topics will include an overview of hemoglobin, laboratory diagnosis and clinical aspects of hemoglobinopathies, including Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemias. In the genomic course, trainees will be immersed in the application of molecular biology techniques (Genomics/Proteomics) and use of scientific equipment. Students will be trained in scientific methods such as experimental design, data collection,  explore the molecular basis (genomics and proteomics) of the role of nutrition, infections/inflammatory response, vascular biology and other acquired versus inherited factors on the severity of hemoglobinopathies.  Trainees will be matched with mentors at MSM and at collaborating institutions to conduct research in hematology, utilizing genomics techniques. Collaborative, multidisciplinary research will be fostered through the availability of faculty with diverse interests on an individual basis, regular program meetings with peers and faculty, as well as participation at local and national meetings and seminars. Trainees will be expected to produce a final paper based on their project, to be submitted for presentation at a national conference and for publication. Trainees will be mandated to write a re-entry grant proposal following their training using various funding agencies, including those available at the NIH and the Fogarty International Center. These proposals will form the foundation of their independent research careers after returning to their home country or institution. Each trainee will receive post-training follow-up from the MSM Faculty Mentor and the Program Directors. Trainees will gain experience by conducting research in a different cultural context, and will be encouraged to pursue research careers in the field of hemoglobinopathies research that involves the use of modern genomic tools. With hope, trainees will become future outstanding researchers who strive to improve care of individuals both burdened by hemoglobinopathies and resource disparities.

"Reducing Sexual Risk in African American Men Who Have Sex With Men: Cooking Club    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS among African American men who have sex with men (MSM) is stark and alarming, and the lack of an effective preventive vaccine or microbicide emphasizes the urgent need for effective behavioral interventions. Although considerable research has been conducted to develop behavioral interventions for MSM in general, few interventions have been developed exclusively for African American MSM whose social community involves a complex intersection of economics, ethnicity, family ties, community values, and personal aspirations, all of which impact on their intimate partnerships and sexual behavior. The specific aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a group-level, Social Cognitive Theory-based sexual risk-reduction intervention for African American HIV infected and uninfected MSM. The intervention weaves proven cognitive-behavioral sexual risk-reduction information and skills-building modules into cooking and meal-sharing activities to engage participants in creating supportive caring communities of friends that value health, self-worth, self-identification as MSM, and social integration. This is a novel ecological approach to HIV risk-reduction in that the intervention re-engineers the social environment and models interpersonal socialization that can be replicated by participants within their own social contexts.       To accomplish the aim, we will build upon our partnerships with two community-based agencies in New York City and propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial among 300 sexually active HIV infected and uninfected African American MSM. Study participants will be randomized to the experimental or control condition in a 1:1 ratio. At baseline and 3 months, standardized data collection using audio computer assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) technology will assess outcomes and covariates. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of unprotected receptive anal sex (URA) and unprotected insertive anal sex (UIA). Secondary outcomes will include 1) number of new and total male sex partners; 2) occurrence of URA and UIA while under the influence of substances; and 3) level of identity integration and self-efficacy for safer sex. This study also will assess moderators of the effect of the intervention on behavior change and other factors identified as important influences of risk behaviors will be assessed. The hypothesis to be tested is that a culturally appropriate, theory-based behavioral intervention that addresses sexual risk and related factors will reduce sexual risk behaviors among African American MSM.           ",Reducing Sexual Risk in African American Men Who Have Sex With Men: Cooking Club,7231171,UR6PS000437,"['clinical trial ', ' cooperative study ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' food processing /preparation ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' homosexual ', ' group therapy ', ' male ', ' African American ', ' community ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' safe sex /sex abstinence ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCHHSTP,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,UR6,2006,298327,0.04773293680008928
"Culture and prevention: Tailored Intervention for African American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite all that is known about HIV prevention, there continues to be some 40,000 new HIV infections per year, with steady or increasing incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) (CDC, 2003c, 2005b). Although African-Americans make up only approximately 13% of the US population, one half of the estimated new numbers of HIV/AIDS diagnoses in the United States occur within this population (CDC, 2006). While African-Americans are clearly disproportionately affected by HIV, interventions which effectively target this group have not been well represented or evaluated in the literature. This proposal is for a randomized, controlled HIV-prevention intervention trial testing the effectiveness of a comprehensive, group-based behavioral intervention in decreasing sexual risk and HIV-infection among African American MSM. The proposed intervention, which will be developed and implemented through collaboration between Howard Brown Health Center and South Side Help Center, will address empirically established variables that increase vulnerability to sexual risk among African-American MSM, including: community stigma, ""self- homophobia"" and its effects on sexual identity; socioeconomic status, and distinctive patterns of substance abuse.

"THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ELIMINATING DISPARITIES I*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) proposes to develop a Center of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach on Health Disparities and Training using a Three Dimensional Approach. The 3-D approach integrates the dynamic components of measured outcomes, determinants and research strategies toward eliminating the disparities in health among different racial and ethnic groups. The MSM proposal builds on the institutional mission, its accomplishments and its unique community environment. MSM has always been committed to the recruitment and education/training of underrepresented minorities for public health professionals, biomedical science careers and primary care providers for underserved communities. Its track record has been outstanding and its work has been recognized by awards from local and national organizations including the American Association of Medical Colleges. Located in southwest Atlanta, with in the Atlanta University Center (AUC)-the largest center historically dedicated to the education of African American students-MSM is ideally situated to develop relevant community partnerships. Based on the opportunity to develop new partnerships, MSM proposes to build on shared concerns about disparities in health to launch additional community partnerships for research and training in eliminating disparities. In time, its partners will include the four undergraduate/graduate colleges of the AUC, a network of concerned Black churches, a southeast network (eight states) of clinicians at community health centers, a community college system, and Emory University Schools of Medicine and Public Health. Other external partnerships (e.g., business and industry) will also be developed. There are four goals for the overall proposal: 1) to educate, motivate and mobilize the community partnerships, 2) to develop the infrastructure within the partnerships to launch the 3-D approach, 3) to develop, expand and conduct multi-disciplinary research to eliminate disparities, and 4) to implement and evaluate strategies/programs to eliminate disparities in health. For each goal there are well-defined and measurable objectives. Developmental and pilot research projects in areas of disparities in cancer, cvd-stroke, maternal and child health, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and mental health are described-each building on existing work in these areas where possible, and each taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the new and expanded partnerships.         ",THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ELIMINATING DISPARITIES I*,7116767,P20MD000272,"['health care quality ', ' health care service availability ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P20,2006,1673322,0.07005290449554527
"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting. These underserved patients and the clinicians who care for them represent the ideal beneficiaries of translating clinical research into clinical practice for the reduction of risk and transmission of HIV and other STDs, as well as the elimination of health disparities.           ",Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study,7163879,R01MH074394,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' premature infant human ', ' clinical trial ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' human ecology ', ' family planning ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' community health service ', ' mother /infant health care ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' perinatal ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' group therapy ', ' female ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' urban area ', ' condom ', ' low birth weight infant human ', "" women's health "", ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' prenatal care ', ' safe sex /sex abstinence ', ' behavior therapy ', ' environmental exposure ', ' patient oriented research ', ' early /brief intervention /therapy ', ' ']",NIMH,"CLINICAL DIRECTORS NETWORK, INC.",R01,2006,569693,0.02554265166225141
"Morehouse School of Medicine Center of Excellence Research Endowment Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The heart of Morehouse School of Medicine's (MSM) mission has been a commitment to excellence in education, clinical service and research since its inception. Our goal is to provide the people and the strategies that lend to the elimination of disparities in health. Based on the need to continue to develop capacity, the area of emphasis addressed in this application is the development of a perpetual resource to support and sustain minority health and health disparities research across Centers and Institutes at MSM. In the last two decades, MSM has established a basic framework for a strong research enterprise as noted by the creation of several Centers and Institutes to further develop research scientists and public health professionals who address discrete areas of health disparities research. Visionary leadership at MSM recognized the critical importance of initiating programs in primary care as well as the development of an effective educational and care delivery framework to serve the underserved in urban and rural areas.  The continuation of the Research Endowment funding is a vitally important mechanism that will facilitate the institution's commitment to become a leader in eliminating health disparities and closing the health gap for minorities and the medically underserved. The proposed funds are vital to the attainment of the institution's goal of achieving national eminence as a leading institution in the area of health disparities research. MSM will leverage these endowment funds to secure additional funds to accomplish the program objectives which are: (1) recruiting faculty with interest in basic, bio-behavioral and clinical research of diseases disproportionately affecting minorities; (2) retaining and supporting the efforts of current faculty in continuing or expanding their portfolio to include health disparities research; (3) developing a research infrastructure that supports cutting edge technologies and skilled technical staff which will enhance fundable research applications.

"An HIV/AIDS prevention Intervention for Chilean women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  At present there are no specific HIV/AIDS prevention programs tailored to the needs of Chilean women, despite their unique vulnerability and the increasing numbers infected by HIV. Serious unmet HIV prevention needs, as well as gender inequalities and other barriers to HIV prevention for low-income Chilean women, were identified in the Prs dissertation (Cianelli, 2003). The proposed research builds on this prior work to develop and test an HIV prevention intervention specifically tailored for low-income Chilean women. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will be used. In Phase I, qualitative interviews will elicit 3erspectives on HIV prevention of men--who control many aspects of women's lives--and of community leadersention to compliment to the relevant attitudes of Chilean women already identified in the Pl's dissertation research. A new HIV intervention tailored for low-income Chilean women, Mano a Mano (Hand to Hand) will be developed integrating the insights of Chilean women, community leaders and men with two existing HIV prevention interventions shown to be effective in other contexts. A pilot test will be conducted to assess the intervention's acceptability and feasibility. Phase II will assess the effectiveness of the Mano a Mano intervention in increasing HIV prevention behaviors for Chilean women. The intervention should improve participants' knowledge, attitudes, and HIV prevention behaviors. A quasi-experimental design with a comparable control group will be used with assessments made at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and follow up at 6 weeks and 3-months. A sample of 500 women (250 in the intervention group and 250 in the control group) will provide adequate power to test the research hypotheses. Because the intervention is low-cost and uses existing infrastructure, its transfer potential will be high. If the intervention is effective, it can be disseminated for low-income women throughout Chile. To build the Prs capacity as an independent researcher, the coinvestigator/mentor team will provide support throughout the 5-year study.

"Culturally-Tailored HIV Risk Reduction for African-American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men of Color who have sex with men, and in particular African-American MSM (AA-MSM), continue to account for a disproportionate percentage of the total HIV/AIDS and STI cases among MSM, both nationally and locally in Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, almost two-thirds of newly diagnosed HIV cases in 2005 among African-Americans were attributable to male-to-male sex contact. In response to CDC RFA-PS06-006, the Center for AIDS Intervention Research/Medical College of Wisconsin in collaboration with three community- based organizations who serve AA-MSM- Diverse and Resilient, Inc., the Milwaukee LGBT Community Center, and Charles 'D' Productions- proposes to: (1) Manualize a theory-based and culturally tailored group-level intervention designed to reduce HIV and STI risk behavior among AA-MSM. (2) Conduct a randomized phase 3 clinical trial with 220 AA-MSM to compare the effectiveness of a rapid HIV testing and counseling risk reduction intervention (HCT-only) to an enhanced intervention that includes the HCT intervention plus a theory-based and culturally tailored small group intervention designed to reduce HIV and STI risk behavior among AA-MSM. (3) Determine whether key demographic (e.g., age) and theoretical variables (e.g., self-efficacy) moderate or mediate observed intervention effects. (4) Compare the cost- effectiveness of the enhanced HCT-plus small-group intervention relative to the HCT-only intervention to determine whether the greater HIV prevention effectiveness of the HCT-plus intervention is sufficient to justify its greater cost. (5) Disseminate study findings through local community and public health forums and training workshops for providers and community advocates, as well as through scientific presentations and publications.       There is an urgent need for HIV and STI prevention interventions for AA-MSM. Our proposed study will address this gap through the conduct and evaluation of an RCT to assess the effectiveness of a culturally- tailored, group-level intervention designed to reduce HIV and STI risk behavior among AA-MSM. If demonstrated efficacious, the intervention will be disseminated for use by community agencies who are working to reduce new cases of HIV and STI infection among AA-MSM, a group disproportionately affected infectious disease burden. Such prevention programs will result in improved sexual health among AA-MSM.           ",Culturally-Tailored HIV Risk Reduction for African-American MSM,7231214,UR6PS000434,"['clinical trial ', ' sexually transmitted disease ', ' cooperative study ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' human subject ', ' AIDS /HIV test ', ' HIV infection ', ' information dissemination ', ' interview ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' homosexual ', ' group therapy ', ' male ', ' African American ', ' culture ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' counseling ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCHHSTP,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,UR6,2006,299769,0.06101036531931216

"Life Skills Intervention: Safety and Coping Among Transgender Youth Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents and young adults 24 years of age and under are among the fastest growing U.S. demographic groups acquiring HIV. The prevalence of HIV infection is disproportionately higher among male-to-female (MTF) transgender individuals, with estimates of HIV prevalence ranging from 11% to greater than 50%. Gender discrimination and stigma, personal attributes (e.g. knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about HIV and substance use), life skill deficits and health care disparities have all been hypothesized as factors associated with HIV risk behaviors in MTF transgender youth. HIV intervention programs tailored specifically to this population currently do not exist. The proposed pilot study is consistent with the conceptual goals of RFA PS06-005: Identifying Ground-Breaking Behavioral Interventions to Prevent Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Transmission in High-Risk Groups. The goal of this study is to use a Social Ecological framework to develop a multi-dimensional HIV prevention program that is tailored to fit the unique needs of this high risk subgroup. The proposed intervention will contain both an individual and group component. The group level intervention will be based off a manual curriculum that focuses on risk behaviors known to be prevalent within this subgroup, including, but not limited to HIV knowledge deficiencies, homelessness, unprotected sex and substance use. The individual level intervention will involve participants meeting one-on-one with the Participant Advocate to address basic needs (access to health care, employment, housing, etc.), further develop skills covered in the group level intervention and to develop individualized behavior goals. Study aims are 1) to develop an HIV prevention intervention for male-to-female transgender young people ages 16- 24; and 2) to evaluate feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of a multi-dimensional HIV prevention intervention; 3) to test a multi-dimensional intervention with 50 MTF Transgender youth ages 16-24 and examine preliminary effects on risky sexual behavior in preparation for a large-scale, efficacy study. The long-term goal of the proposed pilot project is to develop an empirically validated, scientifically based HIV prevention program to reduce HIV risk behavior among MTF transgender youth ages 16-24. Consistent with the goals of the RFP, the final product will be the basis for a multi-site intervention that will be sufficiently brief and of a technical level that can be rapidly disseminated to community-based organizations.              ",Life Skills Intervention: Safety and Coping Among Transgender Youth Adults,7229254,UR6PS000396,"['young adult human (21-34) ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' cooperative study ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' male ', ' clinical research ', ' sexual orientation ', ' ']",NCHHSTP,HOWARD BROWN HEALTH CENTER,UR6,2006,194272,-0.008877809897292274
"MSM CLINICIAL FACULTY RESEARCH AND TRAINING PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  MSM is a nationally recognized, historically black institution established to recruit and train minority and other students as physicians, biomedical scientists, and public health professionals committed to the primary health care needs of the underserved.  In this competitive renewal application, Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) proposes to continue efforts to enhance its institutional infrastructure and the capability of individual faculty members to conduct health services research aimed at improving the quality of health services for African Americans and vulnerable populations and eliminating racial/ethnic health care disparities.  While maintaining its long-term collaborative partnership with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), MSM through this initiative will more effectively integrate the resources of its varied research centers, training programs, and academic departments to provide postdoctoral didactic educational, experiential, and mentored research training and biostatistics and data management support to MSM clinical and other junior faculty members to enhance their abilities for health services research as independent investigators.  Graduate students and medical residents will be exposed to health services research as a career option through participation in ongoing research and development of thesis research projects and other projects for their culminating experiences.  Faculty fellows, identified through academic departments, research centers, and other training programs, will be supported for training for up to two years, depending on their research developmental needs of individual research projects and prerequisite training and experience.  All faculty fellows, graduate students, and medical residents will receive didactic training through methods seminars and workshops, including grant-writing and manuscript preparation workshops, and will participate in routine one-on-one consultations with mentors, bimonthly meetings, monthly journal club discussions, as well as participate in all aspects of ongoing research projects.  The general philosophy of this postdoctoral training program is that minority junior faculty and students will learn by doing, given a supportive, nurturing environment of experienced mentors and technical support.  Each faculty fellow will be required to prepare (1) a PHS-398 research application to be submitted for external funding, and (2) a manuscript for peer-reviewed journal publication, each to include student participation and for review by mentors and advisors.  This program will enhance the research skills and experience of at least 10 junior faculty members over the five-year period, resulting in a stronger MSM research faculty, an increased pool of minority health services researchers, an expanded health services research program, and enhanced research productivity of extramural research, peer-reviewed publications, and national leadership in eliminating health disparities.            ",MSM CLINICIAL FACULTY RESEARCH AND TRAINING PROGRAM,7019918,R24HS011617,"['training ', ' minority institution research support ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' data management ', ' ']",AHRQ,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R24,2006,265715,0.05774756899123436
"HIV Risk Reduction in Migrant Workers This proposed study targeting Alcohol and Other Drug-(AOD) using Migrant Workers (MWs) is a 5-year randomized trial of a Cognitive Behavioral HIV Prevention Intervention (CBI), enhanced/adapted (CBI-A) compared with a Health Promotion (HPC) condition. This application proposes to expand on current ""effective"" behavioral interventions to include contextual components (e.g., Peer Counseling and Motivational Enhancement) that are likely to produce long term maintenance of HIV risk reduction effects. The CBI-A integrates key contextual components targeting peer counseling and motivational interviewing linked to maintaining HIV risk reduction effects. Only two HIV prevention outcome studies of MWs, conducted by our research team, have assessed participants for longer than 6 months. Both studies used a CBI approach and documented a moderate short-term HIV risk reduction effect that diminished at the later follow-up points. The proposed sample (N=320) will be predominantly Hispanic and African-American, low income, sexually active, AOD-using MWs?a group disproportionately affected by HIV and other health disparities. We hypothesize that 1) the CBI-A will produce a greater beneficial effect than the HPC on HIV sexual risk behaviors of 'ratio of protected to unprotected sex following intervention' and frequency of unsafe sex; 2) that the CBI-A will produce more beneficial effects than the HPC in the mediator variables (social influence, stages of change, attitude-motivation-skills); and 3) that the CBI-A will be more effective for participants who are women, acculturated, have high levels of cognitive functioning and no history of traumatic abuse. Structural Equation Modeling analyses will be used to explore how study variables interrelate to affect outcomes. This project addresses the problem of health disparities in HIV risks and the potential to adapt ""effective"" interventions to reach this new population. The proposed project further responds to the NIH priority on rapidly translating and disseminating new knowledge, which emphasizes bringing intervention strategies developed during efficacy trials in a rigorous academic setting, into community settings in a manner adaptable to ""real world"" conditions.

"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting.

"DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As outlined in the goals of Healthy People 2010, eliminating racial/ethnic health disparities, especially with regard to HIV/AIDS, is a major priority in the U.S. Across all racial/ethnic groups and both genders, the highest rates of HIV and AIDS are among African American men, and the predominant mode of transmission among African American men is sex with men. African American men who have sex with men (MSM) are more than two times as likely to be infected with HIV than are MSM of other races/ethnicities. This application proposes a longitudinal study to investigate perceived stress and negative health care attitudes as possible barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence among 200 HIV-infected African American MSM. Although effective HIV treatments are now available, patients must closely adhere for maximum reductions in HIV viral load and increased survival time. Some research indicates that African Americans are less likely to receive and adhere to antiretroviral medications than are Whites, and these differences in treatment patterns could contribute to observed lower survival times among African American, versus White, people with HIV/AIDS. Although discrimination is thought to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in treatment behavior, research has not examined the manifold effects of discrimination on adherence among African American MSM, a subgroup at the nexus of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In this application, discrimination is proposed to influence the health of African American MSM with HIV via multiple pathways, by increasing their chronic, environmental, general, and traumatic stress burden. These discrimination-related stressors are hypothesized to influence treatment behavior directly, via decreased ability to adhere to antiretroviral treatment regimens, as well as indirectly, through the formation of negative attitudes about the health care system (e.g., conspiracy beliefs about HIV). Findings will provide information concerning specific cultural barriers to quality health care among African American MSM with HIV and will be used to make policy recommendations for targeted culturally-relevant outreach measures that address identified barriers at multiple levels, including patients, communities, and health care organizations. In so doing, the conclusions of the proposed research will inform public policy regarding racial/ethnic disparities in health by suggesting factors that may place African American MSM at risk for treatment nonadherence and decreased survival.              ","DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT",7119800,R01MH072351,"['antiviral agent ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' AIDS therapy ', ' HIV infection ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' belief ', ' prejudice ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' homosexual ', ' conflict ', ' male ', ' African American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' environmental stressor ', ' psychological stressor ', ' therapy compliance ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2006,406545,0.10089994658212899

While maintaining its long-term collaborative partnership with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), MSM through this initiative will more effectively integrate the resources of its varied research centers, training programs, and academic departments to provide postdoctoral didactic educational, experiential, and mentored research training and biostatistics and data management support to MSM clinical and other junior faculty members to enhance their abilities for health services research as independent investigators.  Graduate students and medical residents will be exposed to health services research as a career option through participation in ongoing research and development of thesis research projects and other projects for their culminating experiences.  Faculty fellows, identified through academic departments, research centers, and other training programs, will be supported for training for up to two years, depending on their research developmental needs of individual research projects and prerequisite training and experience.  All faculty fellows, graduate students, and medical residents will receive didactic training through methods seminars and workshops, including grant-writing and manuscript preparation workshops, and will participate in routine one-on-one consultations with mentors, bimonthly meetings, monthly journal club discussions, as well as participate in all aspects of ongoing research projects.  The general philosophy of this postdoctoral training program is that minority junior faculty and students will learn by doing, given a supportive, nurturing environment of experienced mentors and technical support.  Each faculty fellow will be required to prepare (1) a PHS-398 research application to be submitted for external funding, and (2) a manuscript for peer-reviewed journal publication, each to include student participation and for review by mentors and advisors.  This program will enhance the research skills and experience of at least 10 junior faculty members over the five-year period, resulting in a stronger MSM research faculty, an increased pool of minority health services researchers, an expanded health services research program, and enhanced research productivity of extramural research, peer-reviewed publications, and national leadership in eliminating health disparities.            ",MSM CLINICIAL FACULTY RESEARCH AND TRAINING PROGRAM,7245039,R24HS011617,[''],AHRQ,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R24,2007,257516,0.05774756899123436
"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed investigation seeks to explore the relationship between interpersonal communication about HIV prevention and HIV testing intentions among adult Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) of their social networks (ages 18-64) in the New York City area. We will conduct a cross-sectional formative research study, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, guided by the following primary aims: 1) to determine the content and contexts of messages being disseminated about HIV prevention strategies and HIV testing among adult NYC-based BMSM and their social networks; and 2) to assess the relationship between interpersonal HIV prevention communication and intent to receive an HIV test among BMSM and their social networks. Secondary aims of the study include: a) to determine how BMSM and other MSM in their social networks diffuse messages about HIV prevention and HIV testing within their social networks; b) to determine what methods and venues for HIV testing are preferred by BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; c) to determine what barriers and facilitators to HIV testing exist among BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; d) to assess how specific psychosocial and behavioral variables (i.e., sexual identity, drug use, unsafe sex, gay-related stigma, HIV-related stigma, gay community attachment, and ethnic community attachment) relate to message diffusion methods as well as HIV testing preferences; and, e) to determine intent to receive HIV testing. Theoretical framework for this study is based primarily on the theory of reasoned action and secondarily on the diffusion of innovation theory. To achieve these aims, we will recruit a total of 300 BMSM and other MSM in their social networks. One hundred (100) BMSM are being recruited via active and passive recruitment methods at specific venues and special community events. These 100 BMSM will then recruit 200 other MSM from within their social networks to participate in the study (i.e., respondent- driven sampling). Data analyses will utilize multivariate analysis techniques (i.e., regression analyses, logistic regression) to determine the power and strength of relationships between interpersonal communication and HIV testing intention variables. Quantitative assessments will be administered via Audio-CASI; qualitative assessments will be administered via structured personal interviews. Mixed-methods strategies simultaneously examining the qualitative and quantitative data will be utilized to explore components of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) framework of the study as well as the content and contexts of HIV prevention through interpersonal communication. Results from this study will facilitate a better understanding about the specific messages being conveyed about HIV prevention and HIV testing between Black men who have sex with men and their friends, peers and sexual partners. Findings will also provide information on how this type of interpersonal communication may relate to behavioral intentions to test for HIV. Information from this study will help inform HIV prevention and testing efforts as well as social marketing and clinical interventions created in response to reducing health disparities as outlined by the Healthy People 2010 objectives and the recent CDC document entitled, A Heightened National Response to the HIV/AIDS Crisis Among African Americans.              ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative",7394235,U01PS000707,[''],NCHHSTP,KINGSBOROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE,U01,2007,233658,0.08441584077146838
"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting. These underserved patients and the clinicians who care for them represent the ideal beneficiaries of translating clinical research into clinical practice for the reduction of risk and transmission of

"An HIV/AIDS prevention Intervention for Chilean women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  At present there are no specific HIV/AIDS prevention programs tailored to the needs of Chilean women, despite their unique vulnerability and the increasing numbers infected by HIV. Serious unmet HIV prevention needs, as well as gender inequalities and other barriers to HIV prevention for low-income Chilean women, were identified in the Prs dissertation (Cianelli, 2003). The proposed research builds on this prior work to develop and test an HIV prevention intervention specifically tailored for low-income Chilean women. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will be used. In Phase I, qualitative interviews will elicit 3erspectives on HIV prevention of men--who control many aspects of women's lives--and of community leadersention to compliment to the relevant attitudes of Chilean women already identified in the Pl's dissertation research. A new HIV intervention tailored for low-income Chilean women, Mano a Mano (Hand to Hand) will be developed integrating the insights of Chilean women, community leaders and men with two existing HIV prevention interventions shown to be effective in other contexts. A pilot test will be conducted to assess the intervention's acceptability and feasibility. Phase II will assess the effectiveness of the Mano a Mano intervention in increasing HIV prevention behaviors for Chilean women. The intervention should improve participants' knowledge, attitudes, and HIV prevention behaviors. A quasi-experimental design with a comparable control group will be used with assessments made at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and follow up at 6 weeks and 3-months. A sample of 500 women (250 in the intervention group and 250 in the control group) will provide adequate power to test the research hypotheses. Because the intervention is low-cost and uses existing infrastructure, its transfer potential will be high. If the intervention is effective, it can be disseminated for low-income women throughout Chile. To build the Prs capacity as an independent researcher, the coinvestigator/mentor team will provide support throughout the 5-year study.

"Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this sequential mixed methods research is to adapt and test a culturally appropriate and effective peer group intervention for HIV prevention specifically for couples in Malawi. Married couples are at risk for HIV infection due to unprotected sex either before or after marriage, and a growing number of couples face the issue of discordant HIV status. However, no current HIV prevention interventions specifically address the unique HIV prevention needs of couples. Gender inequality has long been recognized as a barrier to HIV prevention for married couples, especially the wives. However, the Pi's recent dissertation research has found that the actual decision-making of couples in rural Malawi is more complex than a simple script where the husband always dominates. Couples used husband-dominant cultural scripts, but they also used three other cultural scripts to support shared decision-making: communicating openly, maintaining harmony, and children's welfare. Most couples used a mix of husband-dominated, wife dominated, and shared decision-making. In Phase I. these well-accepted cultural scripts and the shared decision-making style already widely used by couples will be integrated into an existing peer group intervention already used successfully in Malawi. This Couples Peer Group Intervention will be tailored for the needs of married couples. Measures of couple- specific outcomes will also be developed. In Phase II. the intervention will be piloted. A process evaluation will document fidelity, acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. An outcomes evaluation of short-term impacts of the intervention for married couples receiving the intervention compared to a delayed control group, using a pretest and a posttest at three months. The study will be conducted in four low income rural communities in two districts, one with a matrilineal and one with a patrilineal marriage system. Hypotheses will be tested using binomial tests of proportions for binary outcomes and analysis of variance with contrasts for continuous variables. Any baseline differences will be controlled for. We will recruit a total of 120 couples per group at baseline, and with an 80% retention rate the final sample will be at least 96 couples per group. With alpha=.05 this sample will give adequate power (.80) to identify an effect size of .35 for continuous variables (a medium effect). The proposed research is an innovative scientific advance that will integrate culturally appropriate couple decision-making cultural scripts and shared decision-making styles with peer group intervention based on behavioral change theory. The community-based participatory research and examination of both individual-level and couple-level outcomes is also innovative.

"HIV Risk Reduction in Migrant Workers This proposed study targeting Alcohol and Other Drug-(AOD) using Migrant Workers (MWs) is a 5-year randomized trial of a Cognitive Behavioral HIV Prevention Intervention (CBI), enhanced/adapted (CBI-A) compared with a Health Promotion (HPC) condition. This application proposes to expand on current ""effective"" behavioral interventions to include contextual components (e.g., Peer Counseling and Motivational Enhancement) that are likely to produce long term maintenance of HIV risk reduction effects. The CBI-A integrates key contextual components targeting peer counseling and motivational interviewing linked to maintaining HIV risk reduction effects. Only two HIV prevention outcome studies of MWs, conducted by our research team, have assessed participants for longer than 6 months. Both studies used a CBI approach and documented a moderate short-term HIV risk reduction effect that diminished at the later follow-up points. The proposed sample (N=320) will be predominantly Hispanic and African-American, low income, sexually active, AOD-using MWs?a group disproportionately affected by HIV and other health disparities. We hypothesize that 1) the CBI-A will produce a greater beneficial effect than the HPC on HIV sexual risk behaviors of 'ratio of protected to unprotected sex following intervention' and frequency of unsafe sex; 2) that the CBI-A will produce more beneficial effects than the HPC in the mediator variables (social influence, stages of change, attitude-motivation-skills); and 3) that the CBI-A will be more effective for participants who are women, acculturated, have high levels of cognitive functioning and no history of traumatic abuse. Structural Equation Modeling analyses will be used to explore how study variables interrelate to affect outcomes. This project addresses the problem of health disparities in HIV risks and the potential to adapt ""effective"" interventions to reach this new population. The proposed project further responds to the NIH priority on rapidly translating and disseminating new knowledge, which emphasizes bringing intervention strategies developed during efficacy trials in a rigorous academic setting, into community settings in a manner adaptable to ""real world"" conditions. If successful, this research will delineate important HTV intervention strategies that can be practically implemented to improve maintenance of HIV risk behaviors of high-risk AOD-using MWs.

"THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ELIMINATING DISPARITIES I* Morehouse School of Medicine(MSM) proposes to develop a Center of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach on Health Disparities and Training using a Three Dimensional Approach. The 3-D approach integrates the dynamic components of measured outcomes, determinants and research strategies toward eliminating the disparities in health among different racial and ethnic groups. The MSM proposal builds on the institutional mission, its accomplishments and its unique community environment. MSM has always been committed to the recruitment and education/training of underrepresented minorities for public health professionals, biomedical science careers and promary care providers for underserved communities. Its track record has been outstanding and its work had been recognized by awards from local and national organizations including the American Association fo Medical Colleges. Located in southwest Atlanta, withing the Atlanta University Center (AUC)-the largest center historically dedicated to the education of African American students-MSM is ideally situated to develop relevant community partnerships. Based on the opportunity to develop new partnerships, MSM proposes to build on shared concerns about disparities in health to launch additional community partnerships for research and training in eliminating disparities. In time, its partners will include the four undergraduate/graduate colleges of the AUC, a network of concerned Black churches, a southeast network (eight states) of clinicians at community health centers, a community college system, and Emory University Schools of Medicine and Public Health. Other external partnerships (e.g., business and industry) will also be developed. There are four goals for the overall proposal: 1) to educate, motivate and mobilize the community partnerships, 2) to develop the infrastructure within the partnerships to launch the 3-D approach, 3) to develop, expand and conduct multi-disciplinary research to eliminate disparities, and 4) to implement an evaluate strategies/programs to eliminate disparities in health. For each goal there are well-defined and measurable objectives. Developmental and pilot research projects in areas of disparities in cancer, cvdstroke, maternal and child health, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and mental health are described-each building on existing work in these areas where possible, and each taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the new and expanded partnerships.

"DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As outlined in the goals of Healthy People 2010, eliminating racial/ethnic health disparities, especially with regard to HIV/AIDS, is a major priority in the U.S. Across all racial/ethnic groups and both genders, the highest rates of HIV and AIDS are among African American men, and the predominant mode of transmission among African American men is sex with men. African American men who have sex with men (MSM) are more than two times as likely to be infected with HIV than are MSM of other races/ethnicities. This application proposes a longitudinal study to investigate perceived stress and negative health care attitudes as possible barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence among 200 HIV-infected African American MSM. Although effective HIV treatments are now available, patients must closely adhere for maximum reductions in HIV viral load and increased survival time. Some research indicates that African Americans are less likely to receive and adhere to antiretroviral medications than are Whites, and these differences in treatment patterns could contribute to observed lower survival times among African American, versus White, people with HIV/AIDS. Although discrimination is thought to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in treatment behavior, research has not examined the manifold effects of discrimination on adherence among African American MSM, a subgroup at the nexus of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In this application, discrimination is proposed to influence the health of African American MSM with HIV via multiple pathways, by increasing their chronic, environmental, general, and traumatic stress burden. These discrimination-related stressors are hypothesized to influence treatment behavior directly, via decreased ability to adhere to antiretroviral treatment regimens, as well as indirectly, through the formation of negative attitudes about the health care system (e.g., conspiracy beliefs about HIV). Findings will provide information concerning specific cultural barriers to quality health care among African American MSM with HIV and will be used to make policy recommendations for targeted culturally-relevant outreach measures that address identified barriers at multiple levels, including patients, communities, and health care organizations. In so doing, the conclusions of the proposed research will inform public policy regarding racial/ethnic disparities in health by suggesting factors that may place African American MSM at risk for treatment nonadherence and decreased survival.              ","DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT",7228201,R01MH072351,"['Crowding ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Subgroup ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minor ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Policy ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Attitude ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' stressor ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Nexus (resin cement) ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2007,369338,0.10089994658212899
"Life Skills Intervention: Safety and Coping Among Transgender Youth Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents and young adults 24 years of age and under are among the fastest growing U.S. demographic groups acquiring HIV. The prevalence of HIV infection is disproportionately higher among male-to-female (MTF) transgender individuals, with estimates of HIV prevalence ranging from 11% to greater than 50%. Gender discrimination and stigma, personal attributes (e.g. knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about HIV and substance use), life skill deficits and health care disparities have all been hypothesized as factors associated with HIV risk behaviors in MTF transgender youth. HIV intervention programs tailored specifically to this population currently do not exist. The proposed pilot study is consistent with the conceptual goals of RFA PS06-005: Identifying Ground-Breaking Behavioral Interventions to Prevent Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Transmission in High-Risk Groups. The goal of this study is to use a Social Ecological framework to develop a multi-dimensional HIV prevention program that is tailored to fit the unique needs of this high risk subgroup. The proposed intervention will contain both an individual and group component. The group level intervention will be based off a manual curriculum that focuses on risk behaviors known to be prevalent within this subgroup, including, but not limited to HIV knowledge deficiencies, homelessness, unprotected sex and substance use. The individual level intervention will involve participants meeting one-on-one with the Participant Advocate to address basic needs (access to health care, employment, housing, etc.), further develop skills covered in the group level intervention and to develop individualized behavior goals. Study aims are 1) to develop an HIV prevention intervention for male-to-female transgender young people ages 16- 24; and 2) to evaluate feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of a multi-dimensional HIV prevention intervention; 3) to test a multi-dimensional intervention with 50 MTF Transgender youth ages 16-24 and examine preliminary effects on risky sexual behavior in preparation for a large-scale, efficacy study. The long-term goal of the proposed pilot project is to develop an empirically validated, scientifically based HIV prevention program to reduce HIV risk behavior among MTF transgender youth ages 16-24. Consistent with the goals of the RFP, the final product will be the basis for a multi-site intervention that will be sufficiently brief and of a technical level that can be rapidly disseminated to community-based organizations.              ",Life Skills Intervention: Safety and Coping Among Transgender Youth Adults,7284230,UR6PS000396,[''],NCHHSTP,HOWARD BROWN HEALTH CENTER,UR6,2007,270224,-0.008877809897292274

"An HIV/AIDS prevention Intervention for Chilean women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  At present there are no specific HIV/AIDS prevention programs tailored to the needs of Chilean women, despite their unique vulnerability and the increasing numbers infected by HIV. Serious unmet HIV prevention needs, as well as gender inequalities and other barriers to HIV prevention for low-income Chilean women, were identified in the Prs dissertation (Cianelli, 2003). The proposed research builds on this prior work to develop and test an HIV prevention intervention specifically tailored for low-income Chilean women. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will be used. In Phase I, qualitative interviews will elicit 3erspectives on HIV prevention of men--who control many aspects of women's lives--and of community leadersention to compliment to the relevant attitudes of Chilean women already identified in the Pl's dissertation research. A new HIV intervention tailored for low-income Chilean women, Mano a Mano (Hand to Hand) will be developed integrating the insights of Chilean women, community leaders and men with two existing HIV prevention interventions shown to be effective in other contexts. A pilot test will be conducted to assess the intervention's acceptability and feasibility. Phase II will assess the effectiveness of the Mano a Mano intervention in increasing HIV prevention behaviors for Chilean women. The intervention should improve participants' knowledge, attitudes, and HIV prevention behaviors. A quasi-experimental design with a comparable control group will be used with assessments made at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and follow up at 6 weeks and 3-months. A sample of 500 women (250 in the intervention group and 250 in the control group) will provide adequate power to test the research hypotheses. Because the intervention is low-cost and uses existing infrastructure, its transfer potential will be high. If the intervention is effective, it can be disseminated for low-income women throughout Chile. To build the Prs capacity as an independent researcher, the coinvestigator/mentor team will provide support throughout the 5-year study.

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed investigation seeks to explore the relationship between interpersonal communication about HIV prevention and HIV testing intentions among adult Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) of their social networks (ages 18-64) in the New York City area. We will conduct a cross-sectional formative research study, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, guided by the following primary aims: 1) to determine the content and contexts of messages being disseminated about HIV prevention strategies and HIV testing among adult NYC-based BMSM and their social networks; and 2) to assess the relationship between interpersonal HIV prevention communication and intent to receive an HIV test among BMSM and their social networks. Secondary aims of the study include: a) to determine how BMSM and other MSM in their social networks diffuse messages about HIV prevention and HIV testing within their social networks; b) to determine what methods and venues for HIV testing are preferred by BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; c) to determine what barriers and facilitators to HIV testing exist among BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; d) to assess how specific psychosocial and behavioral variables (i.e., sexual identity, drug use, unsafe sex, gay-related stigma, HIV-related stigma, gay community attachment, and ethnic community attachment) relate to message diffusion methods as well as HIV testing preferences; and, e) to determine intent to receive HIV testing. Theoretical framework for this study is based primarily on the theory of reasoned action and secondarily on the diffusion of innovation theory. To achieve these aims, we will recruit a total of 300 BMSM and other MSM in their social networks. One hundred (100) BMSM are being recruited via active and passive recruitment methods at specific venues and special community events. These 100 BMSM will then recruit 200 other MSM from within their social networks to participate in the study (i.e., respondent- driven sampling). Data analyses will utilize multivariate analysis techniques (i.e., regression analyses, logistic regression) to determine the power and strength of relationships between interpersonal communication and HIV testing intention variables. Quantitative assessments will be administered via Audio-CASI; qualitative assessments will be administered via structured personal interviews. Mixed-methods strategies simultaneously examining the qualitative and quantitative data will be utilized to explore components of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) framework of the study as well as the content and contexts of HIV prevention through interpersonal communication. Results from this study will facilitate a better understanding about the specific messages being conveyed about HIV prevention and HIV testing between Black men who have sex with men and their friends, peers and sexual partners. Findings will also provide information on how this type of interpersonal communication may relate to behavioral intentions to test for HIV. Information from this study will help inform HIV prevention and testing efforts as well as social marketing and clinical interventions created in response to reducing health disparities as outlined by the Healthy People 2010 objectives and the recent CDC document entitled, A Heightened National Response to the HIV/AIDS Crisis Among African Americans.              ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative",7497084,U01PS000707,[''],NCHHSTP,KINGSBOROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE,U01,2008,229576,0.08441584077146838
"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting. These underserved patients and the clinicians who care for them represent the ideal beneficiaries of translating clinical research into clinical practice for the reduction of risk and transmission of

"DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As outlined in the goals of Healthy People 2010, eliminating racial/ethnic health disparities, especially with regard to HIV/AIDS, is a major priority in the U.S. Across all racial/ethnic groups and both genders, the highest rates of HIV and AIDS are among African American men, and the predominant mode of transmission among African American men is sex with men. African American men who have sex with men (MSM) are more than two times as likely to be infected with HIV than are MSM of other races/ethnicities. This application proposes a longitudinal study to investigate perceived stress and negative health care attitudes as possible barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence among 200 HIV-infected African American MSM. Although effective HIV treatments are now available, patients must closely adhere for maximum reductions in HIV viral load and increased survival time. Some research indicates that African Americans are less likely to receive and adhere to antiretroviral medications than are Whites, and these differences in treatment patterns could contribute to observed lower survival times among African American, versus White, people with HIV/AIDS. Although discrimination is thought to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in treatment behavior, research has not examined the manifold effects of discrimination on adherence among African American MSM, a subgroup at the nexus of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In this application, discrimination is proposed to influence the health of African American MSM with HIV via multiple pathways, by increasing their chronic, environmental, general, and traumatic stress burden. These discrimination-related stressors are hypothesized to influence treatment behavior directly, via decreased ability to adhere to antiretroviral treatment regimens, as well as indirectly, through the formation of negative attitudes about the health care system (e.g., conspiracy beliefs about HIV). Findings will provide information concerning specific cultural barriers to quality health care among African American MSM with HIV and will be used to make policy recommendations for targeted culturally-relevant outreach measures that address identified barriers at multiple levels, including patients, communities, and health care organizations. In so doing, the conclusions of the proposed research will inform public policy regarding racial/ethnic disparities in health by suggesting factors that may place African American MSM at risk for treatment nonadherence and decreased survival.              ","DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT",7755054,R01MH072351,"['Crowding ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Subgroup ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Rate ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' Future ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Minor ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Policy ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Attitude ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' stressor ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Nexus (resin cement) ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2008,365422,0.10089994658212899
"A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research addresses a critical question for the future success of vaccine, microbicide, pre-exposure prophylaxis and other emerging HIV prevention technologies in the United States: How can we ensure that the community support and program capacity to evaluate and deliver new HIV prevention technologies are available where they are most needed? The research setting (Durham, NC) provides an ideal context to conduct research to address this question. The 5-year study will evaluate a systematic partnership-building approach for HIV prevention trial planning and implementation. The research aims are three-fold. AIM 1 is to implement and conduct a process evaluation of a systematic community-based participatory research model to build support for new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. This is accomplished through use of a conceptual framework that (1) integrates research with policy, community, behavior, and programs; (2) builds on community-based participatory research principles; (3) uses ethnography to generate empirical evidence to inform research design and provide a bridge between local residents, the research team, and other stakeholder groups; and (4) draws on group theory to refine the structure of stakeholder involvement and foster inclusiveness, creativity and active problem-solving. AIM 2 is to describe the communities and group affiliations that exist among young (ages 18-30) at-risk African Americans, and measure the relationship among experiences of discrimination, levels of trust, and support for new HIV prevention technologies in this population. AIM 3 is to identify priorities for evaluating and implementing new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. Research methods include participant observation, ethnographic mapping, focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and quantitative surveys. An HIV prevention technologies research literacy curriculum will be developed, implemented and evaluated; the evaluation will include an assessment of community attitudes toward research on specific HIV prevention technologies. Support for and feasibility of collaboration in conducting local research on new HIV prevention technologies will assessed with multiple stakeholder groups including researchers. Across all years a two-way process evaluation of the evolving community partnership will be undertaken. Sampling strategies include respondent-driven sampling for a community survey of young at-risk African Americans in Years 2 and 3; purposive sampling will be used for all other data collection activities. The results of all data collection activities will be presented to community partners and guidance solicited for next steps in evaluating and delivering new HIV prevention technologies.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience significant health disparities and this is especially evident with regard to HIV/AIDS in the U.S. South. Improving the capacity for HIV prevention trials in partnership with African American communities will lay the groundwork for moving effective interventions into successful prevention programs.          ",A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials,7494918,R01NR011232,"['Creativeness ', ' creativity ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Data Collection ', ' microbicide ', ' microbicidal ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Group Affiliation ', ' Process ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' literacy ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Maps ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Problem Solving ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Vaccines ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NINR,FAMILY HEALTH INTERNATIONAL,R01,2008,339704,0.08736021817137091
"THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ELIMINATING DISPARITIES I* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) proposes to develop a Center of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach on Health Disparities and Training using a Three Dimensional Approach. The 3-D approach integrates the dynamic components of measured outcomes, determinants and research strategies toward eliminating the disparities in health among different racial and ethnic groups. The MSM proposal builds on the institutional mission, its accomplishments and its unique community environment. MSM has always been committed to the recruitment and education/training of underrepresented minorities for public health professionals, biomedical science careers and primary care providers for underserved communities. Its track record has been outstanding and its work has been recognized by awards from local and national organizations including the American Association of Medical Colleges. Located in southwest Atlanta, with in the Atlanta University Center (AUC)-the largest center historically dedicated to the education of African American students-MSM is ideally situated to develop relevant community partnerships. Based on the opportunity to develop new partnerships, MSM proposes to build on shared concerns about disparities in health to launch additional community partnerships for research and training in eliminating disparities. In time, its partners will include the four undergraduate/graduate colleges of the AUC, a network of concerned Black churches, a southeast network (eight states) of clinicians at community health centers, a community college system, and Emory University Schools of Medicine and Public Health. Other external partnerships (e.g., business and industry) will also be developed. There are four goals for the overall proposal: 1) to educate, motivate and mobilize the community partnerships, 2) to develop the infrastructure within the partnerships to launch the 3-D approach, 3) to develop, expand and conduct multi-disciplinary research to eliminate disparities, and 4) to implement and evaluate strategies/programs to eliminate disparities in health. For each goal there are well-defined and measurable objectives. Developmental and pilot research projects in areas of disparities in cancer, cvd-stroke, maternal and child health, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and mental health are described-each building on existing work in these areas where possible, and each taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the new and expanded partnerships.

This program will enhance the research skills and experience of at least 10 junior faculty members over the five-year period, resulting in a stronger MSM research faculty, an increased pool of minority health services researchers, an expanded health services research program, and enhanced research productivity of extramural research, peer-reviewed publications, and national leadership in eliminating health disparities.            ",MSM CLINICIAL FACULTY RESEARCH AND TRAINING PROGRAM,7454355,R24HS011617,[''],AHRQ,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R24,2008,258527,0.05774756899123436
"HIV Risk Reduction in Migrant Workers This proposed study targeting Alcohol and Other Drug-(AOD) using Migrant Workers (MWs) is a 5-year randomized trial of a Cognitive Behavioral HIV Prevention Intervention (CBI), enhanced/adapted (CBI-A) compared with a Health Promotion (HPC) condition. This application proposes to expand on current ""effective"" behavioral interventions to include contextual components (e.g., Peer Counseling and Motivational Enhancement) that are likely to produce long term maintenance of HIV risk reduction effects. The CBI-A integrates key contextual components targeting peer counseling and motivational interviewing linked to maintaining HIV risk reduction effects. Only two HIV prevention outcome studies of MWs, conducted by our research team, have assessed participants for longer than 6 months.

"Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this sequential mixed methods research is to adapt and test a culturally appropriate and effective peer group intervention for HIV prevention specifically for couples in Malawi. Married couples are at risk for HIV infection due to unprotected sex either before or after marriage, and a growing number of couples face the issue of discordant HIV status. However, no current HIV prevention interventions specifically address the unique HIV prevention needs of couples. Gender inequality has long been recognized as a barrier to HIV prevention for married couples, especially the wives. However, the Pi's recent dissertation research has found that the actual decision-making of couples in rural Malawi is more complex than a simple script where the husband always dominates. Couples used husband-dominant cultural scripts, but they also used three other cultural scripts to support shared decision-making: communicating openly, maintaining harmony, and children's welfare. Most couples used a mix of husband-dominated, wife dominated, and shared decision-making. In Phase I. these well-accepted cultural scripts and the shared decision-making style already widely used by couples will be integrated into an existing peer group intervention already used successfully in Malawi. This Couples Peer Group Intervention will be tailored for the needs of married couples. Measures of couple- specific outcomes will also be developed. In Phase II. the intervention will be piloted. A process evaluation will document fidelity, acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. An outcomes evaluation of short-term impacts of the intervention for married couples receiving the intervention compared to a delayed control group, using a pretest and a posttest at three months. The study will be conducted in four low income rural communities in two districts, one with a matrilineal and one with a patrilineal marriage system. Hypotheses will be tested using binomial tests of proportions for binary outcomes and analysis of variance with contrasts for continuous variables. Any baseline differences will be controlled for. We will recruit a total of 120 couples per group at baseline, and with an 80% retention rate the final sample will be at least 96 couples per group. With alpha=.05 this sample will give adequate power (.80) to identify an effect size of .35 for continuous variables (a medium effect). The proposed research is an innovative scientific advance that will integrate culturally appropriate couple decision-making cultural scripts and shared decision-making styles with peer group intervention based on behavioral change theory. The community-based participatory research and examination of both individual-level and couple-level outcomes is also innovative. An acceptable and effective HIV prevention for married couples will have high significance for global HIV prevention.           ",Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi,7455815,R01TW007965,"['Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Action Research ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Resolution ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Leadership ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Inequality ', ' Husband ', ' Wife ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Malawi ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Collaborations ', ' Peer Group ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Schools ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' School Teachers ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexuality ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' health care model ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Rural Community ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' safer sex ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF MALAWI,R01,2008,50760,0.0666914937717333
"An investigation of a Situational Model of Risk for MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed NRSA predoctoral fellowship program is aimed at evaluating a situational model of risky sexual behavior in men who have sex with men (MSM). The research program will focus on determining both differential and common predictors/protective factors of sexual risk in a diverse sample of MSM in terms of age and ethnicity. The broad goal of the project is to come to a better understanding of the variables that influence risky sexual behavior in MSM and to shed light on the disparities in the incidence rates of new HIV infection between subgroups of this population (i.e., subgroups based on age and race/ethinicity). The specific aims of the project are the following. Aim 1:Identify situational factors that contribute to MSM engaging in risky sexual behavior. Aim II: Characterize developmental differences in processes that underlie risk for HIV. Aim 111: Explore racial/ethnic differences in situational risk factors. Data will be collected from participants specific to individual sexual encounters in order to facilitate a prospective within-persons situational analysis of risky sexual behavior. This prospective approach to data collection will help to minimize potential bias in recall of the events surrounding inividual sexual encounters. Furthermore, investigating situational (i.e., event-level) predictors of sexual risk has the potential to reveal predictors of risk that may be overlooked by taking more global measures of predictor variables across multiple sexual encounters. This research will also help to better understand the rising incidence rates of HIV infection in young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and greater prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Black and Latino MSM by helping to differntiate between situational variables that predict risky sexual behavior in these subgroups of MSM. By better understanding the variables the predict why YMSM and Black and Latino MSM seem to be at higher risk for acquiring HIV, researchers, community agencies, and clinicians will be better informed in preventing risky sexual behavior in these groups of MSM. In terms of long-term career development, the predoctoral fellowship will aid me in developing the skills necessary to achieve the broader goal of pursuing a career as a research scientist in an academic research institution. With this goal in mind, the training program will consist of working under the mentorship of Dr. Brian Mustanski in pursuing didactic training in research methodology, protocol development and biostatistics that will be critical in successfully completing the proposed investigation as well as pursuing my long-term career goals.           ",An investigation of a Situational Model of Risk for MSM,7843767,F31MH088942,"['Data Collection ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fellowship ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentorship ', ' Persons ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' meetings ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Impulsivity ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' protocol development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' safer sex ', ' high risk ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' sexual encounter ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F31,2009,41176,0.044687644965598586
"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting. These underserved patients and the clinicians who care for them represent the ideal beneficiaries of translating clinical research into clinical practice for the reduction of risk and transmission of HIV and other STDs, as well as the elimination of health disparities.

The unique cultural context of transgender women creates distinct risk factors that require systematic investigation and then integration into culturally relevant, community-based approaches to intervention. This K08 application describes a comprehensive, integrated training and research plan designed to serve as a pathway to scientific independence and the expertise to develop and test an innovative and urgently needed intervention to improve health outcomes among a highly marginalized population disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The following training objectives are proposed: (1) to acquire expertise in the evaluation and application of theories of behavior change to marginalized populations; (2) to enhance skills in the use of mixed methods data collection and analysis, with an emphasis on techniques relevant to measurement development and theory testing; (3) to gain knowledge and experience with clinical trails methodology, including issues of sampling, randomization, design, protocol development, and ethics; and (4) to obtain training and experience in methods for developing, implementing, and evaluating culturally grounded, theory-driven HIV prevention interventions for transgender women. The specific research aims of the mentored original research are: (1) to describe the role of transgender women's unique cultural context on their HIV-related risk and protective factors; (2) to create new and to adapt existing quantitative measures to more accurately assess psychological dimension sand behavior relevant to transgender women's HIV risk and protective factors; (3) to identify psychosocial factors associated with HIV-related sexual and injection risk behaviors and protective factors among transgender women; and (4) to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-driven, culturally grounded HIV prevention intervention for transgender women.          ",Culturally Relevant HIV Prevention for High-Risk Women,7623269,K08MH085566,"['Data Collection ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Literature ', ' Measurement ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Silicon Dioxide ', ' Tridymite ', ' Silica ', ' Sand ', ' Cristobalite ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' transgender ', ' transsexual ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' protocol development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2009,169303,0.03201045507752648
"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials.

"Men?s Assessment of Social Support and Risk Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal concerns the study of Men's Assessment of Social Support and Risk Networks. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the particular social consequences of the aging of the HIV/AIDS population, either for the challenges faced by persons who live with HIV/AIDS (PWHIV) in later life or for the spread of HIV/AIDS. According to network-epidemiological studies, important clues may be found in the social networks of middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM). The main goal of our research is to develop techniques for eliciting valid social network information from MSM who participate in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). We propose to adapt egocentric social network elicitation techniques that are commonly used in social network studies to gather high-quality network information about both the supportive and risk- behavior networks of MSM. A pilot study will involve querying 60 seropositive and seronegative men participating in the Chicago site of the MACS about the structure of their support networks, drug-sharing networks, and sexual networks. Information will be collected during 20-30 minute face-to-face interviews. Respondents will provide information about the number of people in each of these networks, the nature of their contact with them, how they met, how much they know about those network members' contacts with each other, and what they know about those network members' HIV serostatus, risky behavior (e.g., intravenous drug sharing) behaviors and other risk factors. This information will also give us an idea of the extent of overlap between MSM's drug-sharing and sexual networks. When paired with other information collected in the MACS, this information will make it possible to examine the consequences of social networks both for the impact of HIV/AIDS on quality of life (QOL) as well as for the potential spread of HIV/AIDS in the ""post-HAART era."" Furthermore, these data will allow us to examine how knowledgeable MSM are about the risk-related aspects of their networks, such as to what extent the people with whom they share drugs also share drugs with each other. This reflects our belief that not being knowledgeable about one's supportive and/or risk networks is a risk factor in and of itself. These data will be validated against existing information in the MACS. This pilot study will be used to evaluate the feasibility of creating a Men's Network Structure Assessment (MNSA) module for inclusion in the MACS. This will make high-quality social- and risk-network data readily available to a large number of researchers who use the MACS, thus facilitating the use of social network analysis (SNA) in large, prospective study of MSM. Such data will help shed light on sociodemographic disparities in terms of quality of life (QOL) as well as group differences in risk-taking among PWHIV and provide a basis for targeted social network level interventions. 1 Men's Assessment of Social Support and Risk Network will provide new data regarding the consequences of the aging of the HIV/AIDS population by learning more about the social networks of middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM). The project will develop techniques for eliciting valid social network information from MSM, providing the number of people in each of these networks, the nature of their contact with them, how they met, how much they know about those network members' contacts with each other, and what they know about those network members' HIV status, risky behavior behaviors and other risk factors. The study will also give us an idea of the extent of overlap between MSM's drug-sharing and sexual networks and the consequences of social networks both for the impact of HIV/AIDS on quality of life as well as for the potential spread of HIV/AIDS.           Men's Assessment of Social Support and Risk Network will provide new data regarding the consequences of the aging of the HIV/AIDS population by learning more about the social networks of middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM).

"Improving Racial/Ethnic Minority Participation in Online HIV Prevention Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal, ""Improving racial/ethnic minority participation in online HIV prevention research"", addresses the broad Challenge Area (02): Bioethics, and the specific challenge topic 02- OD(OSP)-102*: Ethical Issues in Health Disparities and Access to Participation in Research. Abstract Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most heavily impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic, both in absolute numbers and in infection rates. Within the US MSM HIV epidemic, black and Hispanic MSM are disproportionately affected compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Although some internet-based HIV prevention interventions have shown preliminary promise, black and Hispanic MSM are consistently and substantially underrepresented in nearly every major internet-based HIV prevention study reported to date. Thus, there is a need for development of improved methods to increase access to participation in internet-based HIV prevention studies for MSM of color. We propose to conduct a mixed-methods approach to increasing participation of black MSM in internet-based HIV prevention studies. In Phase I, we will conduct focus groups with black MSM about barriers to enrollment in internet studies. In Phase II, we will develop and test banner advertisements for recruitment of MSM to an internet study, based on focus group results In Phase III, we will test factors which may relate to black and Hispanic MSM's recruitment to an internet-based HIV prevention study by varying a number factors relating to design and exposure of online recruitment advertisements (such race of models depicted in the advertisements, age, rural versus urban residence, age, education, sexual identity, degree of gay identity of advertisement, and other factors identified by qualitative data); we will calculate click-through rates for black and Hispanic MSM versus other MSM across combinations of these factors. Once black, Hispanic, and white MSM click through to the study, we will enroll 1,000 MSM (of whom roughly one third each will be black non- Hispanic MSM, Hispanic MSM, and white non-Hispanic MSM) in a longitudinal internet preparedness study, to include at-home HIV testing with a commercially available at-home HIV test kit at baseline and at 12 months. Because we know that there are differences in access of MSM of color to private, high-speed internet, the longitudinal study will randomize men to complete interim collections of behavioral data through either an internet survey at 6 months, or through brief monthly text messaging surveys. The purpose of the longitudinal study is to demonstrate feasibility of collection of biological specimens and of prospective followup in an HIV prevention research study including black and Hispanic MSM, and to determine whether text messaging for follow-up data collection is associated with differential retention.

"HEALTH PROMOTION & DISEASE PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Morehouse School of Medicine Prevention Research Center (MSM PRC) seeks continuation funding for the 2009-2014 project period. The MSM PRC conducts interdisciplinary community-based research on prevention in African American and other minority communities, trains minority community-based researchers and public health practitioners, and demonstrates the value of community coalitions in conducting research. The Center is governed by a ""Community Coalition Board"" (CCB) that represents a partnership among Neighborhood Planning Units (NPUs) V, X, Y, and Z, three academic institutions and six agencies (including state and local health departments). The bylaws of the CCB require majority of its membership reflect the community and that the Board Chair always be a community representative. The Center's overall goals are to conduct health promotion and disease prevention research that: 1. Focuses on the major causes of death and disability, especially those that lead to racial/ethnic health status disparities, by testing and demonstrating culturally appropriate health promotion interventions; 2. Improves public health practice within communities by promoting community control of programs and resources and building community capacity to promote health; 3. Cultivates more effective state and local public health programs by communicating and disseminating information on progressive and culturally appropriate approaches to health promotion and disease prevention; and 4. Prepares the next generation of minority translation research scientists, clinicians, prevention research scientists and public health practitioners by providing opportunities for medical students and graduate students in public health and in clinical research to participate in and learn from community-based participatory research projects and programs. Prevention Intervention: Meeting Them at the Gate (PIMTAG) is the Core Research Project for the Center. PIMTAG is a mixed method prevention intervention study that seeks to reduce the risk of primary HIV/STD infections of or by jailed African American males with a history of substance abuse re-entering Atlanta communities through the administration of an educationally based behavior modification intervention. RELEVANCE (See instructions): PIMTAG will impact public health by addressing the Healthy People (HP) 2010 HIV goal to prevent HIV infection and its related illness and death. The Project seeks to reduce the risk of primary HIV/STD infections of or by jailed African American males with a history of substance abuse.

"DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As outlined in the goals of Healthy People 2010, eliminating racial/ethnic health disparities, especially with regard to HIV/AIDS, is a major priority in the U.S. Across all racial/ethnic groups and both genders, the highest rates of HIV and AIDS are among African American men, and the predominant mode of transmission among African American men is sex with men. African American men who have sex with men (MSM) are more than two times as likely to be infected with HIV than are MSM of other races/ethnicities. This application proposes a longitudinal study to investigate perceived stress and negative health care attitudes as possible barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence among 200 HIV-infected African American MSM. Although effective HIV treatments are now available, patients must closely adhere for maximum reductions in HIV viral load and increased survival time. Some research indicates that African Americans are less likely to receive and adhere to antiretroviral medications than are Whites, and these differences in treatment patterns could contribute to observed lower survival times among African American, versus White, people with HIV/AIDS. Although discrimination is thought to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in treatment behavior, research has not examined the manifold effects of discrimination on adherence among African American MSM, a subgroup at the nexus of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In this application, discrimination is proposed to influence the health of African American MSM with HIV via multiple pathways, by increasing their chronic, environmental, general, and traumatic stress burden. These discrimination-related stressors are hypothesized to influence treatment behavior directly, via decreased ability to adhere to antiretroviral treatment regimens, as well as indirectly, through the formation of negative attitudes about the health care system (e.g., conspiracy beliefs about HIV). Findings will provide information concerning specific cultural barriers to quality health care among African American MSM with HIV and will be used to make policy recommendations for targeted culturally-relevant outreach measures that address identified barriers at multiple levels, including patients, communities, and health care organizations. In so doing, the conclusions of the proposed research will inform public policy regarding racial/ethnic disparities in health by suggesting factors that may place African American MSM at risk for treatment nonadherence and decreased survival.

"Explaining Differences in HIV Prevalence and Incidence in Black and White MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stark differences in HIV prevalence and incidence between black and white MSM are well documented, but dozens of studies have shown that the differences in HIV prevalence are not attributable to higher levels of high risk sex, to higher numbers of sexual partners, or to more drug use among black MSM. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct studies to examine factors beyond individual-level risk behaviors (e.g., dyadic and network factors such as concurrency, and community-level factors such as neighborhood-level indicators of disease burden and poverty) and their relationship to HIV risk for black MSM. We propose a prospective cohort study of 340 HIV-negative black MSM and 340 white MSM, with baseline ascertainment and periodic re-ascertainment of individual-level, dyadic and network-level, and community-level factors to better describe the likely complex array of factors that give rise to disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence in black and white MSM. MSM will be recruited using a well- described method of venue-time-space sampling; we will administer an interview and HIV, STI, and drug testing at baseline, and then repeat both interview and testing at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Primary outcomes will be prevalence of HIV, STI and undiagnosed HIV infection, and incidence of HIV, a combined HIV/STI outcome, and unprotected anal intercourse. Information on network and recent partner characteristics will be collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Analyses will examine individual, dyadic and network, and community level factors associated with prevalent or incident outcomes. Our questionnaire will include theoretically-driven measures based on an ecological systems model, which will allow us to translate findings from our study into the development of future HIV prevention interventions for black and white MSM.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MSM continue to be the most heavily impacted group in the US HIV epidemic, and black MSM are disproportinately impacted by HIV as measured by HIV prevalence and incidence. Although MSM comprise nearly half of new annual HIV case reports in the US, only 10% of currently- available best-evidence HIV prevention interventions have been tested with MSM, and none has been tested with black MSM.           Relevance: MSM continue to be the most heavily impacted group in the US HIV epidemic, and black MSM are disproportinately impacted by HIV as measured by HIV prevalence and incidence.

"A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research addresses a critical question for the future success of vaccine, microbicide, pre-exposure prophylaxis and other emerging HIV prevention technologies in the United States: How can we ensure that the community support and program capacity to evaluate and deliver new HIV prevention technologies are available where they are most needed? The research setting (Durham, NC) provides an ideal context to conduct research to address this question. The 5-year study will evaluate a systematic partnership-building approach for HIV prevention trial planning and implementation. The research aims are three-fold. AIM 1 is to implement and conduct a process evaluation of a systematic community-based participatory research model to build support for new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. This is accomplished through use of a conceptual framework that (1) integrates research with policy, community, behavior, and programs; (2) builds on community-based participatory research principles; (3) uses ethnography to generate empirical evidence to inform research design and provide a bridge between local residents, the research team, and other stakeholder groups; and (4) draws on group theory to refine the structure of stakeholder involvement and foster inclusiveness, creativity and active problem-solving. AIM 2 is to describe the communities and group affiliations that exist among young (ages 18-30) at-risk African Americans, and measure the relationship among experiences of discrimination, levels of trust, and support for new HIV prevention technologies in this population. AIM 3 is to identify priorities for evaluating and implementing new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. Research methods include participant observation, ethnographic mapping, focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and quantitative surveys. An HIV prevention technologies research literacy curriculum will be developed, implemented and evaluated; the evaluation will include an assessment of community attitudes toward research on specific HIV prevention technologies. Support for and feasibility of collaboration in conducting local research on new HIV prevention technologies will assessed with multiple stakeholder groups including researchers. Across all years a two-way process evaluation of the evolving community partnership will be undertaken. Sampling strategies include respondent-driven sampling for a community survey of young at-risk African Americans in Years 2 and 3; purposive sampling will be used for all other data collection activities. The results of all data collection activities will be presented to community partners and guidance solicited for next steps in evaluating and delivering new HIV prevention technologies.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience significant health disparities and this is especially evident with regard to HIV/AIDS in the U.S. South. Improving the capacity for HIV prevention trials in partnership with African American communities will lay the groundwork for moving effective interventions into successful prevention programs.

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed investigation seeks to explore the relationship between interpersonal communication about HIV prevention and HIV testing intentions among adult Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) of their social networks (ages 18-64) in the New York City area. We will conduct a cross-sectional formative research study, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, guided by the following primary aims: 1) to determine the content and contexts of messages being disseminated about HIV prevention strategies and HIV testing among adult NYC-based BMSM and their social networks; and 2) to assess the relationship between interpersonal HIV prevention communication and intent to receive an HIV test among BMSM and their social networks. Secondary aims of the study include: a) to determine how BMSM and other MSM in their social networks diffuse messages about HIV prevention and HIV testing within their social networks; b) to determine what methods and venues for HIV testing are preferred by BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; c) to determine what barriers and facilitators to HIV testing exist among BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; d) to assess how specific psychosocial and behavioral variables (i.e., sexual identity, drug use, unsafe sex, gay-related stigma, HIV-related stigma, gay community attachment, and ethnic community attachment) relate to message diffusion methods as well as HIV testing preferences; and, e) to determine intent to receive HIV testing. Theoretical framework for this study is based primarily on the theory of reasoned action and secondarily on the diffusion of innovation theory. To achieve these aims, we will recruit a total of 300 BMSM and other MSM in their social networks. One hundred (100) BMSM are being recruited via active and passive recruitment methods at specific venues and special community events. These 100 BMSM will then recruit 200 other MSM from within their social networks to participate in the study (i.e., respondent- driven sampling). Data analyses will utilize multivariate analysis techniques (i.e., regression analyses, logistic regression) to determine the power and strength of relationships between interpersonal communication and HIV testing intention variables. Quantitative assessments will be administered via Audio-CASI; qualitative assessments will be administered via structured personal interviews. Mixed-methods strategies simultaneously examining the qualitative and quantitative data will be utilized to explore components of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) framework of the study as well as the content and contexts of HIV prevention through interpersonal communication. Results from this study will facilitate a better understanding about the specific messages being conveyed about HIV prevention and HIV testing between Black men who have sex with men and their friends, peers and sexual partners. Findings will also provide information on how this type of interpersonal communication may relate to behavioral intentions to test for HIV. Information from this study will help inform HIV prevention and testing efforts as well as social marketing and clinical interventions created in response to reducing health disparities as outlined by the Healthy People 2010 objectives and the recent CDC document entitled, A Heightened National Response to the HIV/AIDS Crisis Among African Americans.              ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative",7683177,U01PS000707,[''],NCHHSTP,KINGSBOROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE,U01,2009,246376,0.08441584077146838
"Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this sequential mixed methods research is to adapt and test a culturally appropriate and effective peer group intervention for HIV prevention specifically for couples in Malawi. Married couples are at risk for HIV infection due to unprotected sex either before or after marriage, and a growing number of couples face the issue of discordant HIV status. However, no current HIV prevention interventions specifically address the unique HIV prevention needs of couples. Gender inequality has long been recognized as a barrier to HIV prevention for married couples, especially the wives. However, the Pi's recent dissertation research has found that the actual decision-making of couples in rural Malawi is more complex than a simple script where the husband always dominates. Couples used husband-dominant cultural scripts, but they also used three other cultural scripts to support shared decision-making: communicating openly, maintaining harmony, and children's welfare. Most couples used a mix of husband-dominated, wife dominated, and shared decision-making. In Phase I. these well-accepted cultural scripts and the shared decision-making style already widely used by couples will be integrated into an existing peer group intervention already used successfully in Malawi. This Couples Peer Group Intervention will be tailored for the needs of married couples. Measures of couple- specific outcomes will also be developed. In Phase II. the intervention will be piloted. A process evaluation will document fidelity, acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. An outcomes evaluation of short-term impacts of the intervention for married couples receiving the intervention compared to a delayed control group, using a pretest and a posttest at three months. The study will be conducted in four low income rural communities in two districts, one with a matrilineal and one with a patrilineal marriage system. Hypotheses will be tested using binomial tests of proportions for binary outcomes and analysis of variance with contrasts for continuous variables. Any baseline differences will be controlled for. We will recruit a total of 120 couples per group at baseline, and with an 80% retention rate the final sample will be at least 96 couples per group. With alpha=.05 this sample will give adequate power (.80) to identify an effect size of .35 for continuous variables (a medium effect). The proposed research is an innovative scientific advance that will integrate culturally appropriate couple decision-making cultural scripts and shared decision-making styles with peer group intervention based on behavioral change theory. The community-based participatory research and examination of both individual-level and couple-level outcomes is also innovative. An acceptable and effective HIV prevention for married couples will have high significance for global HIV prevention.           ",Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi,7665471,R01TW007965,"['Husband ', ' Wife ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Malawi ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Collaborations ', ' Peer Group ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Schools ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' School Teachers ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexuality ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' health care model ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Rural Community ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' safer sex ', ' community based participatory research ', ' group intervention ', ' shared decision making ', ' Control Groups ', ' Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Action Research ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Resolution ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Leadership ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Inequality ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF MALAWI,R01,2009,50760,0.0666914937717333
"Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS. These disparities have not been adequately explained by individual level factors. Much of the HIV behavioral research to date has focused on measuring specific risk events without consideration of the social, geographic (ie. spatial) and temporal context of these events. Temporal and spatial dimensions are pertinent to the study of same sex behavior, particularly among AA MSM, who experience high levels of stigmatization and discrimination. Social networks have been found to be powerful influences on individuals' behaviors, through processes of social comparison, social monitoring and norm formation. However, what is less understood are the ways in which social networks are also shaped by time and geography. There has been little study of these dimensions as they relate to HIV risk and prevention, especially among AA MSM. The K01 Career Development award will allow me to undertake an interdisciplinary program of study and research concerning the temporal and spatial dimensions of social networks and how these influence HIV risk behavior, specifically among AA MSM. This training will result in my acquisition of knowledge and skills in geography and qualitative methodology to complement my existing research, with the goal of better informing the development of culturally appropriate interventions. Specifically, I will gain: 1) knowledge about concepts and methodologies from the subdisciplines time- geography, cultural geography and health geography as they apply to the study of social networks and HIV, 2) training in time-geography methodology to collect data about HIV risk behavior as it occurs within the context of social networks, place and time, 3) training in observational ethnographic methods, 4) skills in qualitative data analysis and, 5) intensive mentoring and guidance to integrate the training and research with my current research such that I can seek funding as an independent scientist and advance the field of HIV prevention science. One of the primary outcomes of this training will include development of a conceptual model that social scientists can use to design future interventions and studies which incorporates the spatial and temporal dimensions of social networks and HIV risk behavior. This model will serve as a basis for developing a larger R01 level study of AA MSM and HIV risk and development and evaluation of an accompanying HIV prevention behavioral intervention. Furthermore, the research and training from the award will result in scientific publications that will advance the field of HIV prevention and behavioral science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is an interdisciplinary approach to understand the socio-spatial and temporal context of HIV risk behavior among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). Results from this study will identify new conceptual pathways about HIV risk that can inform the development of sustainable culturally- relevant behavioral interventions and policies which bolster preventive behavior within various social contexts and reduce racial disparities in HIV among MSM.           ","Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and

"Strengths and Protective Factors Among Young Men who have Sex with Men (MSM)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic in the US is characterized by enormous demographic disparities, leaving certain sub- population to carry a disproportionate burden of disease. Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) have been particularly hard hit by this epidemic. The research and prevention efforts aimed at reducing transmission in this high risk population have been extensive. And while these efforts have resulted in marked behavior change on the level of the individual participants, we have failed to affect the type of population level change that is necessary to slow the epidemic. In fact, recent CDC surveillance reports suggest that not only are rates of HIV infection among YMSM increasing, they are increasing at a higher rate than among any other risk group. Currently, prevention inteventions rely on a model that suggests that risk behaviors (depression, alcohol use, substance use) mediate the relationship between adversity (violence/victimization) and HIV sexual risk (unprotected anal intercourse). Therefore, HIV prevention interventions rely on diminishing risk in order to promote health. Resilience theory, on the other hand, suggests that the relationship between adversity and risk behaviors, and the relationship between risk behaviors and UAI can be buffered by strengths and protective factors. This project will utilize resilience theory to guide the investigation of strengths and protective factors that exist among YMSM. The short-term goal of the proposed project is to identify factors that protect against HIV sexual risk behaviors. The long term goal ofthe proposed project is to inform the development of youth HIV prevention interventions. With knowledge of protective factors, prevention specialists will be able to develop interventions that rely not only on diminishing risks, but also on promoting strengths. This two-fold approach may give prevention programs the extra potency to reverse the current trends in infection. The specific aims ofthis study are: 1) Using in-depth qualitative interviews, identify strengths and protective factors that help young MSM avoid HIV risk behaviors. 2) Using the strengths and protective factors identified in Aim 1, develop a survey instrument that can be used to measure the Protective Factors construct of the resilience model. 3) Using mediation and moderation analysis test the resilience model in a sample of 200 young MSM aged 16 to 21. This project will contribute to the field of public health by addressing a current gap in our understanding of HIV prevention among youths. The information gained from this project will inform much-needed interventions to address significant health disparities in a highly vulnerable and understudied population.           ",Strengths and Protective Factors Among Young Men who have Sex with Men (MSM),7843857,F31MH087238,"['Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' high risk ', ' depression ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Left ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social isolation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Investigation ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Buffers ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Specialist ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2009,35239,0.03031076151263291
"DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As outlined in the goals of Healthy People 2010, eliminating racial/ethnic health disparities, especially with regard to HIV/AIDS, is a major priority in the U.S. Across all racial/ethnic groups and both genders, the highest rates of HIV and AIDS are among African American men, and the predominant mode of transmission among African American men is sex with men. African American men who have sex with men (MSM) are more than two times as likely to be infected with HIV than are MSM of other races/ethnicities. This application proposes a longitudinal study to investigate perceived stress and negative health care attitudes as possible barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence among 200 HIV-infected African American MSM. Although effective HIV treatments are now available, patients must closely adhere for maximum reductions in HIV viral load and increased survival time. Some research indicates that African Americans are less likely to receive and adhere to antiretroviral medications than are Whites, and these differences in treatment patterns could contribute to observed lower survival times among African American, versus White, people with HIV/AIDS. Although discrimination is thought to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in treatment behavior, research has not examined the manifold effects of discrimination on adherence among African American MSM, a subgroup at the nexus of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In this application, discrimination is proposed to influence the health of African American MSM with HIV via multiple pathways, by increasing their chronic, environmental, general, and traumatic stress burden. These discrimination-related stressors are hypothesized to influence treatment behavior directly, via decreased ability to adhere to antiretroviral treatment regimens, as well as indirectly, through the formation of negative attitudes about the health care system (e.g., conspiracy beliefs about HIV). Findings will provide information concerning specific cultural barriers to quality health care among African American MSM with HIV and will be used to make policy recommendations for targeted culturally-relevant outreach measures that address identified barriers at multiple levels, including patients, communities, and health care organizations. In so doing, the conclusions of the proposed research will inform public policy regarding racial/ethnic disparities in health by suggesting factors that may place African American MSM at risk for treatment nonadherence and decreased survival.              ","DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH CARE ATTITUDES AND HIV TREATMENT",7618647,R01MH072351,"['Crowding ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Subgroup ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minor ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Policy ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Attitude ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' stressor ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' treatment adherence ', ' depression ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,367384,0.10089994658212899
"A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research addresses a critical question for the future success of vaccine, microbicide, pre-exposure prophylaxis and other emerging HIV prevention technologies in the United States: How can we ensure that the community support and program capacity to evaluate and deliver new HIV prevention technologies are available where they are most needed? The research setting (Durham, NC) provides an ideal context to conduct research to address this question. The 5-year study will evaluate a systematic partnership-building approach for HIV prevention trial planning and implementation. The research aims are three-fold. AIM 1 is to implement and conduct a process evaluation of a systematic community-based participatory research model to build support for new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. This is accomplished through use of a conceptual framework that (1) integrates research with policy, community, behavior, and programs; (2) builds on community-based participatory research principles; (3) uses ethnography to generate empirical evidence to inform research design and provide a bridge between local residents, the research team, and other stakeholder groups; and (4) draws on group theory to refine the structure of stakeholder involvement and foster inclusiveness, creativity and active problem-solving. AIM 2 is to describe the communities and group affiliations that exist among young (ages 18-30) at-risk African Americans, and measure the relationship among experiences of discrimination, levels of trust, and support for new HIV prevention technologies in this population. AIM 3 is to identify priorities for evaluating and implementing new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. Research methods include participant observation, ethnographic mapping, focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and quantitative surveys. An HIV prevention technologies research literacy curriculum will be developed, implemented and evaluated; the evaluation will include an assessment of community attitudes toward research on specific HIV prevention technologies. Support for and feasibility of collaboration in conducting local research on new HIV prevention technologies will assessed with multiple stakeholder groups including researchers. Across all years a two-way process evaluation of the evolving community partnership will be undertaken. Sampling strategies include respondent-driven sampling for a community survey of young at-risk African Americans in Years 2 and 3; purposive sampling will be used for all other data collection activities. The results of all data collection activities will be presented to community partners and guidance solicited for next steps in evaluating and delivering new HIV prevention technologies.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience significant health disparities and this is especially evident with regard to HIV/AIDS in the U.S. South.

"Morehouse School of Medicine MEB2 Renovation and Research Core Consolidation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MSM has enjoyed much success in obtaining funds to purchase major shared instrumentation. The Core and Shared-Use facilities were built to relieve the burden of individual investigators attempting to purchase large pieces of equipment, and are available to all MSM researchers. The record of research development and the current research enterprise existing at MSM owes much of its success to the development of research core facilities having allowed generation of over $100 million in research grant funding. MSM has recently engaged in a systematic strategic planning, needs assessment and self-study process leading to the development of a strategic plan. This process has identified significant deficiencies in the physical plant and layout of the research cores that are significant impediments to the ability of these facilities to drive additional growth in the MSM research enterprise. The MEB-2 research space (~ 19,140 sq ft) has been targeted for renovation as the locus for consolidation of our research core facilities. This activity will have a major impact on the institutions ongoing growth as a preeminent minority-serving institution engaged in biomedical and translational research. The scientific program rationale for this G20 proposal focuses on facilitating multi-disciplinary collaborations and translational science relevant to minority health and health disparities research. The renovation plan uses a sustainable facility design that optimizes the efficient use of resources with a goal of achieving LEED silver-level certification. Modular planning principles are the organizational basis of the proposed floor re-configuration to allow for the optimal use of space and personnel as well as flexible and adaptable options for future research opportunities. The design uses a 'laboratory neighborhood concept' to promote relationships between core labs and cross-technology use of personnel through establishing centralized core facility areas, and adjacent open lab spaces. The project will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Renovate the Medical Education Building 2 (MEB2) to create a newly consolidated Central Core Facility of 23,862 gsf sq ft that will provide highly needed improved core efficiency and productivity through optimizing the equipment space, sharing prep facilities and resources, and maximizing human technical resources.; Aim 2: Through the renovation and consolidation of the various Cores, enhance the collegial environment to promote more cross-disciplinary scientific interchange, collaborative teamwork among our scientists, and expanded opportunities for research training.          ",Morehouse School of Medicine MEB2 Renovation and Research Core Consolidation,7937572,G20RR031196,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Medical Education ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Core Facility ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Facility Designs ', ' Floor ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' minority health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' instrumentation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Collaborations ', ' Plants ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Scientist ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' square foot ', ' sq. ft ', ' success ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Certification ', ' Generations ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NCRR,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,G20,2010,9850883,0.028712737784847026
"Explaining Differences in HIV Prevalence and Incidence in Black and White MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stark differences in HIV prevalence and incidence between black and white MSM are well documented, but dozens of studies have shown that the differences in HIV prevalence are not attributable to higher levels of high risk sex, to higher numbers of sexual partners, or to more drug use among black MSM. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct studies to examine factors beyond individual-level risk behaviors (e.g., dyadic and network factors such as concurrency, and community-level factors such as neighborhood-level indicators of disease burden and poverty) and their relationship to HIV risk for black MSM. We propose a prospective cohort study of 340 HIV-negative black MSM and 340 white MSM, with baseline ascertainment and periodic re-ascertainment of individual-level, dyadic and network-level, and community-level factors to better describe the likely complex array of factors that give rise to disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence in black and white MSM. MSM will be recruited using a well- described method of venue-time-space sampling; we will administer an interview and HIV, STI, and drug testing at baseline, and then repeat both interview and testing at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Primary outcomes will be prevalence of HIV, STI and undiagnosed HIV infection, and incidence of HIV, a combined HIV/STI outcome, and unprotected anal intercourse. Information on network and recent partner characteristics will be collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Analyses will examine individual, dyadic and network, and community level factors associated with prevalent or incident outcomes. Our questionnaire will include theoretically-driven measures based on an ecological systems model, which will allow us to translate findings from our study into the development of future HIV prevention interventions for black and white MSM.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MSM continue to be the most heavily impacted group in the US HIV epidemic, and black MSM are disproportinately impacted by HIV as measured by HIV prevalence and incidence. Although MSM comprise nearly half of new annual HIV case reports in the US, only 10% of currently- available best-evidence HIV prevention interventions have been tested with MSM, and none has been tested with black MSM.           Relevance: MSM continue to be the most heavily impacted group in the US HIV epidemic, and black MSM are disproportinately impacted by HIV as measured by HIV prevalence and incidence.

"Morehouse School of Med/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The proposed partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU) and the DAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC) builds upon an existing partnership between these 3 institutions. Each institution brings to the table a unique set of strengths that effectively supplement the inherent weaknesses of the others. It is also worth noting that the Partnership is geographically located within the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African-American population. With this partnership ultimately existing to make a significant contribution to the elimination of the gap in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality between Whites and Blacks, the demographics of the available study population is highly relevant.  The partnership's first objective is the establishment of an effective cancer research program at MSM and TU and developing a pipeline of prospective minority investigators at TU. One way to address this objective is through an effective Research Training and Career Development (RTCD) Program. Our program would continue to tap the pool of talented faculty and students currently at MSM and TU and link them to established investigators and research infrastructure at the UABCCC. A second way to address this priority is through our Developmental Research Program, which provides research project funding opportunities to be conducted in parallel to the RTCD Program. Last, our Cancer Education Program encourages graduates and undergraduates from across scientific disciplines to pursue careers in the biosciences and provides a pipeline into our RTCD and Developmental Research Programs. The partnership's additional objectives are to expand our established Community Outreach Program to promote cancer awareness and healthy lifestyles among our most underserved populations and to increase minority participation in therapeutic clinical trials. Our Bioethics Shared Resource not only is important in promoting and insuring adherence to bioethical principles, but also addresses important ethical considerations in relationships between majority and minority institutions and between institutions and underserved communities. With continued success, we anticipate that this partnership will provide UABCCC, MSM and TU with an enhanced capability to conduct cancer health disparity research.  In summary, we propose to accomplish our objectives through the enhancement of four existing programs, Developmental Research, Research Training and Career Development, Community Outreach, and Cancer Education Programs. The Programs are additionally supported by the Bioethics and Biostatistics Shared Resource.

"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting. These underserved patients and the clinicians who care for them represent the ideal beneficiaries of translating clinical research into clinical practice for the reduction of risk and transmission of HIV and other STDs, as well as the elimination of health disparities.           ",Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study,7899877,R01MH074394,"['group

"A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Bruthas Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW) are at particular risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and represent a priority population for developing effective interventions. Despite the urgent need for effective prevention approaches for AAMSMW, to our knowledge no evidence-based HIV interventions have been developed and tested for this population. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of the Bruthas Project, an individual-level HIV prevention intervention, which builds on standardized HIV counseling and testing. Delivered in a series of four sessions by trained African American male counselors, the BP focuses on reviewing HIV transmission routes for male and female partners, strengthening sexual communication skills with both male and female partners, and improving condom use skills and other safer sex negotiation strategies. A randomized controlled trial of BP is necessary to determine the efficacy of the intervention and can lead to improved public health efforts at reducing HIV risk behavior among AAMSMW and in the African American community more generally. To evaluate the effect of the BP, we will recruit and enroll a cohort of 400 AAMSMW who will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition, in which they will be offered BP, or to the comparison condition, in which they will receive standardized HIV testing and counseling with referral to case management. We will follow the cohort over 9 months and will assess participants at three time points: baseline, 3 months follow-up, and 6 months follow- up.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to respond to the HIV epidemic in the African American community is a national public health priority. Men account for more than half of HIV infections among African Americans. We have worked diligently over the past four years to develop a HIV prevention intervention for African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW), the Bruthas Project. No controlled intervention studies to date have proven to be effective in significantly lowering HIV-related risk behavior for AAMSMW. Given the urgency of the epidemic among African Americans in general, and African American MSM in particular, a large scale randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to test the efficacy of this promising HIV prevention intervention for these men, and if it is found to be effective, to move it quickly into practice.           Narrative The need to respond to the HIV epidemic in the African American community is a national public health priority.

It is also worth noting that the Partnership is geographically located within the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African-American population. With this partnership ultimately existing to make a significant contribution to the elimination of the gap in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality between Whites and Blacks, the demographics of the available study population is highly relevant.  The partnership's first objective is the establishment of an effective cancer research program at MSM and TU and developing a pipeline of prospective minority investigators at TU. One way to address this objective is through an effective Research Training and Career Development (RTCD) Program. Our program would continue to tap the pool of talented faculty and students currently at MSM and TU and link them to established investigators and research infrastructure at the UABCCC. A second way to address this priority is through our Developmental Research Program, which provides research project funding opportunities to be conducted in parallel to the RTCD Program. Last, our Cancer Education Program encourages graduates and undergraduates from across scientific disciplines to pursue careers in the biosciences and provides a pipeline into our RTCD and Developmental Research Programs. The partnership's additional objectives are to expand our established Community Outreach Program to promote cancer awareness and healthy lifestyles among our most underserved populations and to increase minority participation in therapeutic clinical trials.

"Improving Racial/Ethnic Minority Participation in Online HIV Prevention Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal, ""Improving racial/ethnic minority participation in online HIV prevention research"", addresses the broad Challenge Area (02): Bioethics, and the specific challenge topic 02- OD(OSP)-102*: Ethical Issues in Health Disparities and Access to Participation in Research. Abstract Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most heavily impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic, both in absolute numbers and in infection rates. Within the US MSM HIV epidemic, black and Hispanic MSM are disproportionately affected compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Although some internet-based HIV prevention interventions have shown preliminary promise, black and Hispanic MSM are consistently and substantially underrepresented in nearly every major internet-based HIV prevention study reported to date. Thus, there is a need for development of improved methods to increase access to participation in internet-based HIV prevention studies for MSM of color. We propose to conduct a mixed-methods approach to increasing participation of black MSM in internet-based HIV prevention studies. In Phase I, we will conduct focus groups with black MSM about barriers to enrollment in internet studies. In Phase II, we will develop and test banner advertisements for recruitment of MSM to an internet study, based on focus group results In Phase III, we will test factors which may relate to black and Hispanic MSM's recruitment to an internet-based HIV prevention study by varying a number factors relating to design and exposure of online recruitment advertisements (such race of models depicted in the advertisements, age, rural versus urban residence, age, education, sexual identity, degree of gay identity of advertisement, and other factors identified by qualitative data); we will calculate click-through rates for black and Hispanic MSM versus other MSM across combinations of these factors. Once black, Hispanic, and white MSM click through to the study, we will enroll 1,000 MSM (of whom roughly one third each will be black non- Hispanic MSM, Hispanic MSM, and white non-Hispanic MSM) in a longitudinal internet preparedness study, to include at-home HIV testing with a commercially available at-home HIV test kit at baseline and at 12 months. Because we know that there are differences in access of MSM of color to private, high-speed internet, the longitudinal study will randomize men to complete interim collections of behavioral data through either an internet survey at 6 months, or through brief monthly text messaging surveys. The purpose of the longitudinal study is to demonstrate feasibility of collection of biological specimens and of prospective followup in an HIV prevention research study including black and Hispanic MSM, and to determine whether text messaging for follow-up data collection is associated with differential retention. Expected outcomes are recommended best practices for increasing recruitment of black and Hispanic MSM to internet-based HIV prevention trials, and experience with collection of biological specimens for trial endpoints and capacity for retention in such trials.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MSM, especially MSM of color, are the most heavily impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic, but only 10% of the available best-evidence HIV prevention interventions have been tested with HIV- negative MSM, and MSM of color have been underrepresented in internet-based prevention research. Our project proposes to develop methods that will facilitate recruitment and retention of MSM of color in the rigorous evaluation of online HIV prevention interventions.           MSM, especially MSM of color, are the most heavily impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic, but only 10% of the available best-evidence HIV prevention interventions have been tested with HIV- negative MSM, and MSM of color have been underrepresented in internet-based prevention research.

"Post exposure prophylaxis among IDU syringe customers-Pharmacy pilot intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this research is to evaluate a structural pilot intervention which aims to expand pharmacy services to include provision of non-occupational HIV post exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and risk reduction information to injection drug users (IDUs) who buy syringes at two pharmacies registered with the New York State Expanded Syringe Access Program (ESAP), a program allowing pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription to help reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs. PEP is the standard of care for health care workers who experience an accidental needle stick. The probability of HIV transmission in IDUs through sharing syringes is either similar to or higher than the risk of an occupational needle stick, which supports the use of nPEP in these cases. There is a preponderance of data supporting PEP (i.e., antiretroviral therapy) as an effective strategy to prevent HIV infection. Thus, PEP is recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in non-occupational cases (exposure via high risk sex or injection behavior) when the exposure source is HIV positive or when the source is unknown but from a HIV prevalent community (e15%). ESAP's success creates a new window of opportunity to offer nPEP as a medically-based HIV prevention approach to low-risk IDUs such as ESAP participants who mostly access sterile syringes but may have an unplanned exposure. By targeting pharmacies in low-income, black and Hispanic communities where HIV burden is highest, a pharmacy-based nPEP program has the potential to create a more comprehensive HIV prevention plan that addresses the long-standing problem of racial disparities in HIV/AIDS. Thus, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate a pharmacy-based nPEP program by comparing IDU syringe customers who would agree to pharmacy-based nPEP vs. those who would decline (in the event of an accidental exposure) with respect to demographics, risk behaviors, perceptions of health care access/needs among IDU syringe customers. Using a pre/post design targeted to syringe customers and their peers we will determine if IDUs/peers who receive nPEP information and risk reduction counseling are more likely to 1) have increased and accurate knowledge of nPEP as an HIV prevention strategy (over time), and 2) more frequently share accurate information about nPEP, risk reduction, and HIV prevention with peers (over time) with respect to baseline demographics, risk behavior, and healthcare needs and access (Aim 2). Among those request nPEP and eligible (i.e., low injection/sex risk IDUs) we will assess side effects and nPEP adherence, risk behavior, social networks, and attitudes and opinions about nPEP via clinical follow up. We will conduct key- informant interviews among key stakeholders (n=15) and enroll IDU syringe customers (and referred peers) from pharmacies providing nPEP information/risk reduction counseling via print materials and video followed by a baseline A-CASI survey (n=638). A peer-driven intervention component will facilitate recruitment and dissemination of nPEP information. Participants will return in 3-months to assess behavior, knowledge, and spread of nPEP information. Analysis will include standard qualitative and quantitative regression techniques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is highly significant and innovative in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV prevention for injection drug users (IDUs), namely pharmacies participating in a nonprescription syringe sales program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access among IDUs in New York City (NYC). This new HIV prevention strategy adds a medical model to the current HIV prevention strategy. This new strategy includes delivery of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in non-occupational situations such as following injection or sexual exposure to HIV which has been recommended by CDC and evaluated among men who have sex with men but never before among IDUs. Our goal is to specifically tackle HIV racial disparities by targeting our pilot intervention to the black and Hispanic communities most heavily burdened with HIV/AIDS. Building on years of IDU and pharmacy-based research, we have selected two public health-minded pharmacies with a sizable and consistent IDU syringe purchasing customer base as the initial PEP delivery venue (as opposed to a visit to a medical setting to obtain a prescription) since IDUs typically experience challenges in accessing care. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only throughout other high-risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other cities and states where similar pharmacy syringe access programs exist. Broader public health impact could also follow, for example, pharmacists can partner with clinicians and other health care providers, including community based organizations to offer these expanded services to groups with limited access to health care services.           NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly significant and innovative in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV prevention for injection drug users (IDUs), namely pharmacies participating in a nonprescription syringe sales program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access among IDUs in New York City (NYC).

"A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research addresses a critical question for the future success of vaccine, microbicide, pre-exposure prophylaxis and other emerging HIV prevention technologies in the United States: How can we ensure that the community support and program capacity to evaluate and deliver new HIV prevention technologies are available where they are most needed? The research setting (Durham, NC) provides an ideal context to conduct research to address this question. The 5-year study will evaluate a systematic partnership-building approach for HIV prevention trial planning and implementation. The research aims are three-fold. AIM 1 is to implement and conduct a process evaluation of a systematic community-based participatory research model to build support for new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. This is accomplished through use of a conceptual framework that (1) integrates research with policy, community, behavior, and programs; (2) builds on community-based participatory research principles; (3) uses ethnography to generate empirical evidence to inform research design and provide a bridge between local residents, the research team, and other stakeholder groups; and (4) draws on group theory to refine the structure of stakeholder involvement and foster inclusiveness, creativity and active problem-solving. AIM 2 is to describe the communities and group affiliations that exist among young (ages 18-30) at-risk African Americans, and measure the relationship among experiences of discrimination, levels of trust, and support for new HIV prevention technologies in this population. AIM 3 is to identify priorities for evaluating and implementing new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. Research methods include participant observation, ethnographic mapping, focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and quantitative surveys. An HIV prevention technologies research literacy curriculum will be developed, implemented and evaluated; the evaluation will include an assessment of community attitudes toward research on specific HIV prevention technologies. Support for and feasibility of collaboration in conducting local research on new HIV prevention technologies will assessed with multiple stakeholder groups including researchers. Across all years a two-way process evaluation of the evolving community partnership will be undertaken. Sampling strategies include respondent-driven sampling for a community survey of young at-risk African Americans in Years 2 and 3; purposive sampling will be used for all other data collection activities. The results of all data collection activities will be presented to community partners and guidance solicited for next steps in evaluating and delivering new HIV prevention technologies.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience significant health disparities and this is especially evident with regard to HIV/AIDS in the U.S. South. Improving the capacity for HIV prevention trials in partnership with African American communities will lay the groundwork for moving effective interventions into successful prevention programs.          ",A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials,7878544,R01NR011232,"['Creativeness ', ' creativity ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Data Collection ', ' microbicide ', ' microbicidal ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Group Affiliation ', ' Process ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' literacy ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Maps ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Vaccines ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' ']",NINR,FAMILY HEALTH INTERNATIONAL,R01,2010,547395,0.08736021817137091
"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed investigation seeks to explore the relationship between interpersonal communication about HIV prevention and HIV testing intentions among adult Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) of their social networks (ages 18-64) in the New York City area. We will conduct a cross-sectional formative research study, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, guided by the following primary aims: 1) to determine the content and contexts of messages being disseminated about HIV prevention strategies and HIV testing among adult NYC-based BMSM and their social networks; and 2) to assess the relationship between interpersonal HIV prevention communication and intent to receive an HIV test among BMSM and their social networks. Secondary aims of the study include: a) to determine how BMSM and other MSM in their social networks diffuse messages about HIV prevention and HIV testing within their social networks; b) to determine what methods and venues for HIV testing are preferred by BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; c) to determine what barriers and facilitators to HIV testing exist among BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; d) to assess how specific psychosocial and behavioral variables (i.e., sexual identity, drug use, unsafe sex, gay-related stigma, HIV-related stigma, gay community attachment, and ethnic community attachment) relate to message diffusion methods as well as HIV testing preferences; and, e) to determine intent to receive HIV testing. Theoretical framework for this study is based primarily on the theory of reasoned action and secondarily on the diffusion of innovation theory. To achieve these aims, we will recruit a total of 300 BMSM and other MSM in their social networks. One hundred (100) BMSM are being recruited via active and passive recruitment methods at specific venues and special community events. These 100 BMSM will then recruit 200 other MSM from within their social networks to participate in the study (i.e., respondent- driven sampling). Data analyses will utilize multivariate analysis techniques (i.e., regression analyses, logistic regression) to determine the power and strength of relationships between interpersonal communication and HIV testing intention variables. Quantitative assessments will be administered via Audio-CASI; qualitative assessments will be administered via structured personal interviews. Mixed-methods strategies simultaneously examining the qualitative and quantitative data will be utilized to explore components of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) framework of the study as well as the content and contexts of HIV prevention through interpersonal communication. Results from this study will facilitate a better understanding about the specific messages being conveyed about HIV prevention and HIV testing between Black men who have sex with men and their friends, peers and sexual partners. Findings will also provide information on how this type of interpersonal communication may relate to behavioral intentions to test for HIV. Information from this study will help inform HIV prevention and testing efforts as well as social marketing and clinical interventions created in response to reducing health disparities as outlined by the Healthy People 2010 objectives and the recent CDC document entitled, A Heightened National Response to the HIV/AIDS Crisis Among African Americans.              ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative",7922597,U01PS000707,[''],NCHHSTP,KINGSBOROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE,U01,2010,353337,0.08441584077146838
"Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this sequential mixed methods research is to adapt and test a culturally appropriate and effective peer group intervention for HIV prevention specifically for couples in Malawi. Married couples are at risk for HIV infection due to unprotected sex either before or after marriage, and a growing number of couples face the issue of discordant HIV status. However, no current HIV prevention interventions specifically address the unique HIV prevention needs of couples. Gender inequality has long been recognized as a barrier to HIV prevention for married couples, especially the wives. However, the Pi's recent dissertation research has found that the actual decision-making of couples in rural Malawi is more complex than a simple script where the husband always dominates. Couples used husband-dominant cultural scripts, but they also used three other cultural scripts to support shared decision-making: communicating openly, maintaining harmony, and children's welfare. Most couples used a mix of husband-dominated, wife dominated, and shared decision-making. In Phase I. these well-accepted cultural scripts and the shared decision-making style already widely used by couples will be integrated into an existing peer group intervention already used successfully in Malawi. This Couples Peer Group Intervention will be tailored for the needs of married couples. Measures of couple- specific outcomes will also be developed. In Phase II. the intervention will be piloted. A process evaluation will document fidelity, acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. An outcomes evaluation of short-term impacts of the intervention for married couples receiving the intervention compared to a delayed control group, using a pretest and a posttest at three months. The study will be conducted in four low income rural communities in two districts, one with a matrilineal and one with a patrilineal marriage system. Hypotheses will be tested using binomial tests of proportions for binary outcomes and analysis of variance with contrasts for continuous variables. Any baseline differences will be controlled for. We will recruit a total of 120 couples per group at baseline, and with an 80% retention rate the final sample will be at least 96 couples per group. With alpha=.05 this sample will give adequate power (.80) to identify an effect size of .35 for continuous variables (a medium effect). The proposed research is an innovative scientific advance that will integrate culturally appropriate couple decision-making cultural scripts and shared decision-making styles with peer group intervention based on behavioral change theory. The community-based participatory research and examination of both individual-level and couple-level outcomes is also innovative. An acceptable and effective HIV prevention for married couples will have high significance for global HIV prevention.           ",Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi,7897818,R01TW007965,"['Address ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Resolution ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Leadership ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Inequality ', ' Husband ', ' Wife ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Malawi ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Collaborations ', ' Peer Group ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Schools ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' School Teachers ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexuality ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' health care model ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Rural Community ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' safer sex ', ' community based participatory research ', ' group intervention ', ' shared decision making ', ' Control Groups ', ' Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Action Research ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Low income ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF MALAWI,R01,2010,50760,0.0666914937717333
"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting. These underserved patients and the clinicians who care for them represent the ideal beneficiaries of translating clinical research into clinical practice for the reduction of risk and transmission of HIV and other STDs, as well as the elimination of health disparities.

"Men?s Assessment of Social Support and Risk Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal concerns the study of Men's Assessment of Social Support and Risk Networks. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the particular social consequences of the aging of the HIV/AIDS population, either for the challenges faced by persons who live with HIV/AIDS (PWHIV) in later life or for the spread of HIV/AIDS. According to network-epidemiological studies, important clues may be found in the social networks of middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM). The main goal of our research is to develop techniques for eliciting valid social network information from MSM who participate in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). We propose to adapt egocentric social network elicitation techniques that are commonly used in social network studies to gather high-quality network information about both the supportive and risk- behavior networks of MSM. A pilot study will involve querying 60 seropositive and seronegative men participating in the Chicago site of the MACS about the structure of their support networks, drug-sharing networks, and sexual networks. Information will be collected during 20-30 minute face-to-face interviews. Respondents will provide information about the number of people in each of these networks, the nature of their contact with them, how they met, how much they know about those network members' contacts with each other, and what they know about those network members' HIV serostatus, risky behavior (e.g., intravenous drug sharing) behaviors and other risk factors. This information will also give us an idea of the extent of overlap between MSM's drug-sharing and sexual networks. When paired with other information collected in the MACS, this information will make it possible to examine the consequences of social networks both for the impact of HIV/AIDS on quality of life (QOL) as well as for the potential spread of HIV/AIDS in the ""post-HAART era."" Furthermore, these data will allow us to examine how knowledgeable MSM are about the risk-related aspects of their networks, such as to what extent the people with whom they share drugs also share drugs with each other. This reflects our belief that not being knowledgeable about one's supportive and/or risk networks is a risk factor in and of itself. These data will be validated against existing information in the MACS. This pilot study will be used to evaluate the feasibility of creating a Men's Network Structure Assessment (MNSA) module for inclusion in the MACS. This will make high-quality social- and risk-network data readily available to a large number of researchers who use the MACS, thus facilitating the use of social network analysis (SNA) in large, prospective study of MSM. Such data will help shed light on sociodemographic disparities in terms of quality of life (QOL) as well as group differences in risk-taking among PWHIV and provide a basis for targeted social network level interventions. 1 Men's Assessment of Social Support and Risk Network will provide new data regarding the consequences of the aging of the HIV/AIDS population by learning more about the social networks of middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM). The project will develop techniques for eliciting valid social network information from MSM, providing the number of people in each of these networks, the nature of their contact with them, how they met, how much they know about those network members' contacts with each other, and what they know about those network members' HIV status, risky behavior behaviors and other risk factors. The study will also give us an idea of the extent of overlap between MSM's drug-sharing and sexual networks and the consequences of social networks both for the impact of HIV/AIDS on quality of life as well as for the potential spread of HIV/AIDS.           Men's Assessment of Social Support and Risk Network will provide new data regarding the consequences of the aging of the HIV/AIDS population by learning more about the social networks of middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM).

"Social Determinants of HIV Risk and Vulnerability among Black MSM in South Africa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Until recently, the existence of HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub- Saharan Africa has been overlooked. Much current public health research has highlighted an epidemiological blind spot regarding hidden HIV epidemics among MSM in sub-Saharan Africa, and specifically in South Africa. These studies indicate that HIV risk among MSM is structured by social and economic inequalities as well as a deeply stigmatizing and discriminatory social context regarding same-sex practices, particularly among black MSM. This study will examine the social structuring of HIV risk and vulnerability among black MSM populations in order to contribute to the development of effective HIV prevention interventions among these groups. It will conduct this research in two specific settings: 1) a public health-focused sexual health promotion program (based in Johannesburg, South Africa); and 2) an antiretroviral (ARV) chemoprophylaxis HIV prevention clinical trial (based in Cape Town, South Africa). Aims: The specific aims of the study are: 1) to describe the key social and cultural determinants that structure HIV risk and vulnerability among black MSM in urban South Africa; 2) to understand how the social and cultural differences among MSM populations in South Africa, particularly with regard to race and gendered sex roles (e.g., masculine/active and feminine/passive), affect perceptions of HIV risk and influence high-risk sexual practices; and 3) to understand and compare how public health-focused health promotion versus antiretroviral chemoprohylaxis approaches to HIV prevention address various structural barriers to HIV prevention among black MSM. Methods: To examine these issues, qualitative methods will be used to understand the social processes that structure HIV risk and vulnerability and mediate access to HIV prevention interventions. Data will be drawn from participant-observation, discourse analysis, 1- hour semi-structured key informant interviews will be conducted with 40 men from the two sites (20 men from each site; and 20 men from each of two groups: gay- and non-gay-identified MSM), and 1- to 3-hour life history interviews will be conducted with 12 men (6 from each site; and 6 from each of two groups: gay- and non-gay- identified MSM). Analysis: Data collected from interview transcripts, field notes taken during participant observations, and through discourse analysis of media reports, including posters, conversations, radio chat shows, pamphlets, television stories, and news clippings wil be subjected to a grounded theory approach to data analysis that is commonly used for qualitative and ethnographic data.

"Health,Hope and Healing:A National conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities and is on par with those found in several African countries. HIV directly or indirectly related to men having sex with men is the single largest contributor to HIV infection among Blacks, accounting for nearly half of all cases among Black men. Despite large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV prevalence and risk, just one tested intervention specifically for Black men who have sex with men (MSM) has been published. Furthermore, Black men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) have been particularly underserved and underrepresented in HIV research. Attention must be lent to address the behavioral, psychological, socio-cultural, and biomedical factors, as well as the racial/ethnic disparities that exist and contribute to HIV infection and transmission among Black MSM and MSMW. This 5-year R13 conference grant proposal entitled, Health, Hope and Healing (H3): A National Conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW, will assemble the best minds currently studying HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW. The H3 conference series, with an annual meeting over five years, aims to advance HIV biobehavioral research, mentor junior investigators, and foster community based participatory collaborations. The three measurable conference outcomes are to: 1) Produce an executive report detailing the long term research, training and policy agenda, highlighting recommendations designed to reduce HIV in Black MSM and MSMW; 2) Produce an executive report detailing successful mentorship of junior investigators; and 3) Develop successful community based participatory research collaboratives, as measured by the submission of at least one joint proposal that operationalizes the research. The H3 Conference series will be among the first to discuss the needs of Black MSM and MSMW within a holistic and socio-cultural paradigm and disseminate research findings and healthcare and policy recommendations for eliminating HIV/AIDS within this population.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities. Researchers, clinicians, community members and congressman have all advocated for more attention to this epidemic.

"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting. These underserved patients and the clinicians who care for them represent the ideal beneficiaries of translating clinical research into clinical practice for the reduction of risk and transmission of HIV and other STDs, as well as the elimination of health disparities.           ",Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study,7899867,R01MH074399,"['Risk

"Developing and Implementing a Cancer Prevention and Control Research Curriculum t    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop and execute a cancer prevention and control curriculum training program at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) that will help prepare professional students in public health and in the biomedical sciences for positions in cancer prevention and control research. The curriculum will be based on a framework for addressing cancer prevention and control from bench to bedside to community and will emphasize research targeted at reduction and elimination of cancer disparities. It will include courses that will provide the students with a suitable knowledge base in the areas of cancer epidemiology and cancer prevention and control and that will teach them how to do research in cancer prevention and control and to develop interventions to reduce disparities; practicum experiences designed to enhance the understanding and application of knowledge and research findings in cancer prevention and control to public health settings by providing an opportunity to gain practical experience, at an appropriate level and content, in the field of cancer prevention and control; and opportunities to conduct research in cancer prevention and control under the guidance of cancer researchers. The faculty of this training program will be drawn from the various graduate teaching programs at MSM, thereby integrating it into MSM training programs. The curriculum will be developed in year one, and it will be offered to students in MSM's Master of Public Health, Master of Science in Clinical Research, Doctor of Medicine and Minority Summer Public Health Fellowship programs. An evaluation plan will be implemented to constantly monitor the program and assess its success in achieving its goals and objectives, and the results will be used for ongoing improvement.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a tremendous need in the US to increase the number of minority scientists, particularly in academic medicine. Although African Americans suffer from major health disparities, less than 1% of investigator-initiated grant dollars go to Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCU) and less than 1% of R01-funded research is awarded to African American researchers. This R25 grant will help to ensure that investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), an HBCU, can play a major role in cancer research by creating a cadre of public health and health care professionals at MSM who have an increased capacity to describe health disparities related to cancer and associated mechanisms over time and across the cancer continuum, and by strengthening the skills and level of competence of MSM graduates in preparation for their inclusion in the public health workforce in the field of cancer prevention and control.           Project Narrative There is a tremendous need in the US to increase the number of minority scientists, particularly in academic medicine.

"Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS. These disparities have not been adequately explained by individual level factors. Much of the HIV behavioral research to date has focused on measuring specific risk events without consideration of the social, geographic (ie. spatial) and temporal context of these events. Temporal and spatial dimensions are pertinent to the study of same sex behavior, particularly among AA MSM, who experience high levels of stigmatization and discrimination. Social networks have been found to be powerful influences on individuals' behaviors, through processes of social comparison, social monitoring and norm formation. However, what is less understood are the ways in which social networks are also shaped by time and geography. There has been little study of these dimensions as they relate to HIV risk and prevention, especially among AA MSM. The K01 Career Development award will allow me to undertake an interdisciplinary program of study and research concerning the temporal and spatial dimensions of social networks and how these influence HIV risk behavior, specifically among AA MSM. This training will result in my acquisition of knowledge and skills in geography and qualitative methodology to complement my existing research, with the goal of better informing the development of culturally appropriate interventions. Specifically, I will gain: 1) knowledge about concepts and methodologies from the subdisciplines time- geography, cultural geography and health geography as they apply to the study of social networks and HIV, 2) training in time-geography methodology to collect data about HIV risk behavior as it occurs within the context of social networks, place and time, 3) training in observational ethnographic methods, 4) skills in qualitative data analysis and, 5) intensive mentoring and guidance to integrate the training and research with my current research such that I can seek funding as an independent scientist and advance the field of HIV prevention science. One of the primary outcomes of this training will include development of a conceptual model that social scientists can use to design future interventions and studies which incorporates the spatial and temporal dimensions of social networks and HIV risk behavior. This model will serve as a basis for developing a larger R01 level study of AA MSM and HIV risk and development and evaluation of an accompanying HIV prevention behavioral intervention. Furthermore, the research and training from the award will result in scientific publications that will advance the field of HIV prevention and behavioral science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is an interdisciplinary approach to understand the socio-spatial and temporal context of HIV risk behavior among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). Results from this study will identify new conceptual pathways about HIV risk that can inform the development of sustainable culturally- relevant behavioral interventions and policies which bolster preventive behavior within various social contexts and reduce racial disparities in HIV among MSM.           ","Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and

"Culturally Relevant HIV Prevention for High-Risk Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth with a female identity) are an understudied group with HIV prevalence rates in the range of 22 - 66%. Public health intervention research has produced no theory-driven, evidence-based interventions for transgender women. The unique cultural context of transgender women creates distinct risk factors that require systematic investigation and then integration into culturally relevant, community-based approaches to intervention. This K08 application describes a comprehensive, integrated training and research plan designed to serve as a pathway to scientific independence and the expertise to develop and test an innovative and urgently needed intervention to improve health outcomes among a highly marginalized population disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The following training objectives are proposed: (1) to acquire expertise in the evaluation and application of theories of behavior change to marginalized populations; (2) to enhance skills in the use of mixed methods data collection and analysis, with an emphasis on techniques relevant to measurement development and theory testing; (3) to gain knowledge and experience with clinical trails methodology, including issues of sampling, randomization, design, protocol development, and ethics; and (4) to obtain training and experience in methods for developing, implementing, and evaluating culturally grounded, theory-driven HIV prevention interventions for transgender women. The specific research aims of the mentored original research are: (1) to describe the role of transgender women's unique cultural context on their HIV-related risk and protective factors; (2) to create new and to adapt existing quantitative measures to more accurately assess psychological dimension sand behavior relevant to transgender women's HIV risk and protective factors; (3) to identify psychosocial factors associated with HIV-related sexual and injection risk behaviors and protective factors among transgender women; and (4) to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-driven, culturally grounded HIV prevention intervention for transgender women.          ",Culturally Relevant HIV Prevention for High-Risk Women,7751810,K08MH085566,"['Data Collection ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Literature ', ' Measurement ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Silicon Dioxide ', ' Tridymite ', ' Silica ', ' Sand ', ' Cristobalite ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' transgender ', ' transsexual ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' protocol development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2010,168011,0.03201045507752648
"THREE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ELIMINATING DISPARITIES I* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) proposes to develop a Center of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach on Health Disparities and Training using a Three Dimensional Approach. The 3-D approach integrates the dynamic components of measured outcomes, determinants and research strategies toward eliminating the disparities in health among different racial and ethnic groups. The MSM proposal builds on the institutional mission, its accomplishments and its unique community environment. MSM has always been committed to the recruitment and education/training of underrepresented minorities for public health professionals, biomedical science careers and primary care providers for underserved communities. Its track record has been outstanding and its work has been recognized by awards from local and national organizations including the American Association of Medical Colleges. Located in southwest Atlanta, with in the Atlanta University Center (AUC)-the largest center historically dedicated to the education of African American students-MSM is ideally situated to develop relevant community partnerships. Based on the opportunity to develop new partnerships, MSM proposes to build on shared concerns about disparities in health to launch additional community partnerships for research and training in eliminating disparities. In time, its partners will include the four undergraduate/graduate colleges of the AUC, a network of concerned Black churches, a southeast network (eight states) of clinicians at community health centers, a community college system, and Emory University Schools of Medicine and Public Health. Other external partnerships (e.g., business and industry) will also be developed. There are four goals for the overall proposal: 1) to educate, motivate and mobilize the community partnerships, 2) to develop the infrastructure within the partnerships to launch the 3-D approach, 3) to develop, expand and conduct multi-disciplinary research to eliminate disparities, and 4) to implement and evaluate strategies/programs to eliminate disparities in health. For each goal there are well-defined and measurable objectives. Developmental and pilot research projects in areas of disparities in cancer, cvd-stroke, maternal and child health, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and mental health are described-each building on existing work in these areas where possible, and each taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the new and expanded partnerships.

"Prevention of HIV Infection in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Risk for HIV infection in the United States falls along sharp lines of disparity related to sexual orientation and race/ethnicity. HIV infection has always taken a heavy toll on men who have sex with men (MSM) and also on African Americans. However, HIV incidence disparity is most striking of all for MSM who are also African American, a segment that probably accounts for less than one percent of the American population but fully 25% of all new HIV infections in the United States. Surprisingly, very few HIV prevention interventions designed for African American MSM have been undertaken, and most existing approaches have relied on individual or small-group risk reduction counseling. These existing models have limited cultural and practical suitability for reaching high-risk African American MSM who are hidden in the community and unlikely to seek out sexual risk reduction counseling. Interventions directed to individuals alone also do not attend sufficiently to the important influence played by social norms and social network factors on risk behavior. In contrast to individual counseling models, HIV prevention interventions that are directed to social networks of Black MSM in the community and that work through natural influence channels within these networks hold the potential for reaching deeply into hidden and vulnerable populations of African American MSM. Network-level HIV prevention interventions rely on oral communication traditions and cultural models appropriate in minority communities, and can strengthen social network normative support for risk reduction. Following a 1-year formative research phase that will provide data needed to contextualize the study's recruitment, assessment, and intervention content and delivery methods, we will undertake a social network-level intervention outcome trial in 3 cities: Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Miami. Project-wide, 24 sociocentric networks of African American MSM-each expected to be composed of approximately 40 people (total n=960 participants)-will be recruited. 12 of the networks (n=480 participants) will be randomized to a comparison condition and receive HIV/STD testing, treatment, and individual counseling. The other 12 networks (n=480) will receive the same counseling and testing and also a social network intervention that identifies, trains, and engages empirically-identified influence leaders of each network to deliver ongoing, theory-based, and culturally tailored HIV prevention advice, recommendations, and support to other network members. The study will determine the comparative effectiveness of the social network intervention to the counseling, testing, and treatment comparison condition on measures of sexual risk, substance use associated with sexual risk behavior, and STD/HIV incidence assessed with laboratory measures at 6- and 18-month followup points. The study aim is to develop and determine the efficacy of an intervention modality capable of reaching and preventing HIV among high-risk African American MSM in the community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 56,000 Americans continue to contract HIV each year, and African American MSM account for a far disproportionate number of incident infections. Public health efforts to reduce HIV incidence in the United States require the development of new prevention approaches delivered using modalities that can target and reach those population segments at greatest vulnerability. If successful, this research will identify an HIV prevention intervention approach, practical for public health service providers, that lends itself well to rapid uptake and use by CBOs, health departments, and minority organizations concerned about AIDS.           PREVENTION OF HIV INFECTION IN HIGH-RISK SOCIAL NETWORKS  OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MSM  Project Narrative  56,000 Americans continue to contract HIV each year, and African American MSM account for a far disproportionate number of incident infections.

"HEALTH PROMOTION & DISEASE PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Morehouse School of Medicine Prevention Research Center (MSM PRC) seeks continuation funding for the 2009-2014 project period. The MSM PRC conducts interdisciplinary community-based research on prevention in African American and other minority communities, trains minority community-based researchers and public health practitioners, and demonstrates the value of community coalitions in conducting research. The Center is governed by a ""Community Coalition Board"" (CCB) that represents a partnership among Neighborhood Planning Units (NPUs) V, X, Y, and Z, three academic institutions and six agencies (including state and local health departments). The bylaws of the CCB require majority of its membership reflect the community and that the Board Chair always be a community representative. The Center's overall goals are to conduct health promotion and disease prevention research that: 1. Focuses on the major causes of death and disability, especially those that lead to racial/ethnic health status disparities, by testing and demonstrating culturally appropriate health promotion interventions; 2. Improves public health practice within communities by promoting community control of programs and resources and building community capacity to promote health; 3. Cultivates more effective state and local public health programs by communicating and disseminating information on progressive and culturally appropriate approaches to health promotion and disease prevention; and 4. Prepares the next generation of minority translation research scientists, clinicians, prevention research scientists and public health practitioners by providing opportunities for medical students and graduate students in public health and in clinical research to participate in and learn from community-based participatory research projects and programs. Prevention Intervention: Meeting Them at the Gate (PIMTAG) is the Core Research Project for the Center. PIMTAG is a mixed method prevention intervention study that seeks to reduce the risk of primary HIV/STD infections of or by jailed African American males with a history of substance abuse re-entering Atlanta communities through the administration of an educationally based behavior modification intervention. RELEVANCE (See instructions): PIMTAG will impact public health by addressing the Healthy People (HP) 2010 HIV goal to prevent HIV infection and its related illness and death. The Project seeks to reduce the risk of primary HIV/STD infections of or by jailed African American males with a history of substance abuse. Targeted populations in both HP 2010 and PIMTAG Aims are persons disproportionately affected by HIV-African-American males.             ",HEALTH PROMOTION & DISEASE PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER,7922111,U48DP001907,[''],NCCDPHP,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U48,2010,1073178,0.006811733453064992
"Integrating Prenatal Care to Reduce HIV/STDs Among Teens: A Translational Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during and after pregnancy among adolescents and young women (aged 14-19) receiving prenatal care in 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving predominantly Black and Latina communities in the New York City Metropolitan area. We will evaluate an innovative model of group prenatal care that integrates HIV prevention (CenteringPregnancy Plus, CP+) and has already yielded favorable biological and behavioral outcomes in a large NIMH-sponsored randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specific aims are to: (1) Translate an efficacious HIV prevention intervention to 14 CHCs; (2) Test the effectiveness of this intervention by (a) examining behavioral and biological outcomes via prospective measurement throughout the prenatal period and up to one year postpartum (N=1400), and (b) identifying potential mechanisms of the effects of group prenatal care, using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework; and (3) Conduct a rigorous process evaluation to identify factors that influence the uptake, fidelity, and sustainability of this intervention. Using a clustered randomized controlled design, CHCs will be randomly assigned to group care or individual standard of care. We hypothesize that CP+ will be effectively translated to CHCs, and that it will result in significant reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors, significantly lower rates of STDs and repeat pregnancies, as well as improvements in perinatal outcomes. While extensive resources have been devoted to efficacy trials, fewer resources have been devoted to identify the effectiveness of programs implemented in ""real world"" settings, such as CHCs, where one in ten women - including many at highest risk for HIV/STDs -- receive prenatal care. The proposed research is responsive to the PA-01-123, seeking to support multi-site collaborative intervention trials. This represents an important advance in interdisciplinary HIV prevention research for adolescent women: integrating a theoretically-driven and empirically-validated program for HIV/STD prevention into prenatal care is a promising way to provide sustainable care and disease prevention in a culturally-tailored setting. These underserved patients and the clinicians who care for them represent the ideal beneficiaries of translating clinical research into clinical practice for the reduction of risk and transmission of HIV and other STDs, as well as the elimination of health disparities.

"Health,Hope and Healing:A National conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities and is on par with those found in several African countries. HIV directly or indirectly related to men having sex with men is the single largest contributor to HIV infection among Blacks, accounting for nearly half of all cases among Black men. Despite large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV prevalence and risk, just one tested intervention specifically for Black men who have sex with men (MSM) has been published. Furthermore, Black men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) have been particularly underserved and underrepresented in HIV research. Attention must be lent to address the behavioral, psychological, socio-cultural, and biomedical factors, as well as the racial/ethnic disparities that exist and contribute to HIV infection and transmission among Black MSM and MSMW. This 5-year R13 conference grant proposal entitled, Health, Hope and Healing (H3): A National Conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW, will assemble the best minds currently studying HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW. The H3 conference series, with an annual meeting over five years, aims to advance HIV biobehavioral research, mentor junior investigators, and foster community based participatory collaborations. The three measurable conference outcomes are to: 1) Produce an executive report detailing the long term research, training and policy agenda, highlighting recommendations designed to reduce HIV in Black MSM and MSMW; 2) Produce an executive report detailing successful mentorship of junior investigators; and 3) Develop successful community based participatory research collaboratives, as measured by the submission of at least one joint proposal that operationalizes the research. The H3 Conference series will be among the first to discuss the needs of Black MSM and MSMW within a holistic and socio-cultural paradigm and disseminate research findings and healthcare and policy recommendations for eliminating HIV/AIDS within this population.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities. Researchers, clinicians, community members and congressman have all advocated for more attention to this epidemic. The proposed Health, Hope and Healing conference will gather the best minds currently studying HIV among Black MSM and MSMW. This conference aims to advance research, mentor junior investigators, foster community based participatory collaborations and disseminate findings and recommendations for the purpose of eliminating HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW.            Project Narrative The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities.

"Prevention of HIV Infection in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Risk for HIV infection in the United States falls along sharp lines of disparity related to sexual orientation and race/ethnicity. HIV infection has always taken a heavy toll on men who have sex with men (MSM) and also on African Americans. However, HIV incidence disparity is most striking of all for MSM who are also African American, a segment that probably accounts for less than one percent of the American population but fully 25% of all new HIV infections in the United States. Surprisingly, very few HIV prevention interventions designed for African American MSM have been undertaken, and most existing approaches have relied on individual or small-group risk reduction counseling. These existing models have limited cultural and practical suitability for reaching high-risk African American MSM who are hidden in the community and unlikely to seek out sexual risk reduction counseling. Interventions directed to individuals alone also do not attend sufficiently to the important influence played by social norms and social network factors on risk behavior. In contrast to individual counseling models, HIV prevention interventions that are directed to social networks of Black MSM in the community and that work through natural influence channels within these networks hold the potential for reaching deeply into hidden and vulnerable populations of African American MSM. Network-level HIV prevention interventions rely on oral communication traditions and cultural models appropriate in minority communities, and can strengthen social network normative support for risk reduction. Following a 1-year formative research phase that will provide data needed to contextualize the study's recruitment, assessment, and intervention content and delivery methods, we will undertake a social network-level intervention outcome trial in 3 cities: Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Miami. Project-wide, 24 sociocentric networks of African American MSM-each expected to be composed of approximately 40 people (total n=960 participants)-will be recruited. 12 of the networks (n=480 participants) will be randomized to a comparison condition and receive HIV/STD testing, treatment, and individual counseling. The other 12 networks (n=480) will receive the same counseling and testing and also a social network intervention that identifies, trains, and engages empirically-identified influence leaders of each network to deliver ongoing, theory-based, and culturally tailored HIV prevention advice, recommendations, and support to other network members. The study will determine the comparative effectiveness of the social network intervention to the counseling, testing, and treatment comparison condition on measures of sexual risk, substance use associated with sexual risk behavior, and STD/HIV incidence assessed with laboratory measures at 6- and 18-month followup points. The study aim is to develop and determine the efficacy of an intervention modality capable of reaching and preventing HIV among high-risk African American MSM in the community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 56,000 Americans continue to contract HIV each year, and African American MSM account for a far disproportionate number of incident infections. Public health efforts to reduce HIV incidence in the United States require the development of new prevention approaches delivered using modalities that can target and reach those population segments at greatest vulnerability. If successful, this research will identify an HIV prevention intervention approach, practical for public health service providers, that lends itself well to rapid uptake and use by CBOs, health departments, and minority organizations concerned about AIDS.           PREVENTION OF HIV INFECTION IN HIGH-RISK SOCIAL NETWORKS  OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MSM  Project Narrative  56,000 Americans continue to contract HIV each year, and African American MSM account for a far disproportionate number of incident infections.

"HEALTH PROMOTION & DISEASE PREVENTION RESEARCH CENTER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Morehouse School of Medicine Prevention Research Center (MSM PRC) seeks continuation funding for the 2009-2014 project period. The MSM PRC conducts interdisciplinary community-based research on prevention in African American and other minority communities, trains minority community-based researchers and public health practitioners, and demonstrates the value of community coalitions in conducting research. The Center is governed by a ""Community Coalition Board"" (CCB) that represents a partnership among Neighborhood Planning Units (NPUs) V, X, Y, and Z, three academic institutions and six agencies (including state and local health departments). The bylaws of the CCB require majority of its membership reflect the community and that the Board Chair always be a community representative. The Center's overall goals are to conduct health promotion and disease prevention research that: 1. Focuses on the major causes of death and disability, especially those that lead to racial/ethnic health status disparities, by testing and demonstrating culturally appropriate health promotion interventions; 2. Improves public health practice within communities by promoting community control of programs and resources and building community capacity to promote health; 3. Cultivates more effective state and local public health programs by communicating and disseminating information on progressive and culturally appropriate approaches to health promotion and disease prevention; and 4. Prepares the next generation of minority translation research scientists, clinicians, prevention research scientists and public health practitioners by providing opportunities for medical students and graduate students in public health and in clinical research to participate in and learn from community-based participatory research projects and programs. Prevention Intervention: Meeting Them at the Gate (PIMTAG) is the Core Research Project for the Center. PIMTAG is a mixed method prevention intervention study that seeks to reduce the risk of primary HIV/STD infections of or by jailed African American males with a history of substance abuse re-entering Atlanta communities through the administration of an educationally based behavior modification intervention. RELEVANCE (See instructions): PIMTAG will impact public health by addressing the Healthy People (HP) 2010 HIV goal to prevent HIV infection and its related illness and death. The Project seeks to reduce the risk of primary HIV/STD infections of or by jailed African American males with a history of substance abuse.

"An investigation of a Situational Model of Risk for MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed NRSA predoctoral fellowship program is aimed at evaluating a situational model of risky sexual behavior in men who have sex with men (MSM). The research program will focus on determining both differential and common predictors/protective factors of sexual risk in a diverse sample of MSM in terms of age and ethnicity. The broad goal of the project is to come to a better understanding of the variables that influence risky sexual behavior in MSM and to shed light on the disparities in the incidence rates of new HIV infection between subgroups of this population (i.e., subgroups based on age and race/ethinicity). The specific aims of the project are the following. Aim 1:Identify situational factors that contribute to MSM engaging in risky sexual behavior. Aim II: Characterize developmental differences in processes that underlie risk for HIV. Aim 111: Explore racial/ethnic differences in situational risk factors. Data will be collected from participants specific to individual sexual encounters in order to facilitate a prospective within-persons situational analysis of risky sexual behavior. This prospective approach to data collection will help to minimize potential bias in recall of the events surrounding inividual sexual encounters. Furthermore, investigating situational (i.e., event-level) predictors of sexual risk has the potential to reveal predictors of risk that may be overlooked by taking more global measures of predictor variables across multiple sexual encounters. This research will also help to better understand the rising incidence rates of HIV infection in young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and greater prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Black and Latino MSM by helping to differntiate between situational variables that predict risky sexual behavior in these subgroups of MSM. By better understanding the variables the predict why YMSM and Black and Latino MSM seem to be at higher risk for acquiring HIV, researchers, community agencies, and clinicians will be better informed in preventing risky sexual behavior in these groups of MSM. In terms of long-term career development, the predoctoral fellowship will aid me in developing the skills necessary to achieve the broader goal of pursuing a career as a research scientist in an academic research institution. With this goal in mind, the training program will consist of working under the mentorship of Dr. Brian Mustanski in pursuing didactic training in research methodology, protocol development and biostatistics that will be critical in successfully completing the proposed investigation as well as pursuing my long-term career goals.           ",An investigation of a Situational Model of Risk for MSM,8151082,F31MH088942,"['high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Individual Differences ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Data Collection ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Fellowship ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Caucasians ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Latino ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' diaries ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' programs ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Evaluation ', ' Age ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Process ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Prevalence ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Sampling ', ' Incidence ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' career development ', ' base ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' Measures ', ' Data ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' meetings ', ' Affect ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Institution ', ' Population ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' social ', ' Accounting ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Work ', ' Modeling ', ' Event ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' prospective ', ' Scientist ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' sex ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Persons ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Mentorship ', ' career ', ' Risk ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Mind ', ' Individual ', ' Infection ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Investigation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' high risk ', ' Communities ', ' skills ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Testing ', ' Participant ', ' protocol development ', ' Coping Skills ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' sexual encounter ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' safer sex ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F31,2011,31000,0.044687644965598586
"Peer-driven Intervention to Seek, Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 21% of HIV infections in the U.S. are undiagnosed, but only about 40% of all adults have been tested. Thus, late diagnosis of HIV is common, and, furthermore, treatment delays and disruptions are widespread. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to test for HIV, are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late, and experience serious barriers to entering care compared to other groups. Our research team has studied HHR in New York City (NYC) as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) studies. We found an HIV prevalence rate of 7.4% among HHR in NYC, and only 6% of these infections had been previously diagnosed. Further, in central Brooklyn, 10% were newly diagnosed with HIV. The proposed study will use NHBS methodology to target HHR. Reduced rates of HIV testing and treatment among HHR are due to structural (e.g., poor access), social (e.g., peer norms), and individual-level (e.g., low perceived risk) barriers. Thus active recruitment approaches modeled after NHBS are needed to overcome structural barriers, and peer-delivered interventions effectively reduce individual and social barriers to testing and treatment. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-level enhanced peer-driven intervention (PDI) to seek, test, treat and retain HHR. The enhanced PDI is tailored specifically for HHR and includes computerized, navigation, and peer-delivered components to enhance future sustainability. The design of the intervention is guided by the Theories of Triadic Influence and Normative Regulation. Similar to NHBS, the enhanced PDI will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS). NHBS protocols use both venue-based sampling (VBS) and RDS for reaching populations at high risk. However, VBS and RDS have not yet been directly compared in terms of their yield of undiagnosed HIV infections. Thus the specific aims of this five-year proposed study are to: (1) compare the yield and efficiency of RDS and VBS to identify undiagnosed HIV infection among HHR; (2) measure the efficacy of an enhanced PDI compared to a control in terms of time to HIV care and HAART initiation, viral load suppression, and retention among those newly diagnosed; (3) examine whether the effects of the PDI on HIV health/treatment outcomes are mediated by changes in individual (e.g., perceived risk), social (e.g., peer norms), and structural influences (e.g., enhanced access), and/or whether other factors (e.g., substance use) moderate its effects; and (4) to project the costs and cost-effectiveness of RDS vs. VBS and PDI. We will conduct the enhanced PDI (N=3000) in central Brooklyn, a location hyperendemic for HIV and where HHR experience poor access to testing and treatment. Simultaneously, VBS (N=400) will be undertaken in central Brooklyn. The proposed study complements local and national HIV prevention initiatives and is designed to contribute an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. The vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino; therefore the proposed study may also impact racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to have been tested for HIV, do not test as frequently, and are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late compared to other risk groups. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to develop an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. Because the vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino, the project has great potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.           Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to have been tested for HIV, do not test as frequently, and are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late compared to other risk groups.

"A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Bruthas Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW) are at particular risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and represent a priority population for developing effective interventions. Despite the urgent need for effective prevention approaches for AAMSMW, to our knowledge no evidence-based HIV interventions have been developed and tested for this population. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of the Bruthas Project, an individual-level HIV prevention intervention, which builds on standardized HIV counseling and testing. Delivered in a series of four sessions by trained African American male counselors, the BP focuses on reviewing HIV transmission routes for male and female partners, strengthening sexual communication skills with both male and female partners, and improving condom use skills and other safer sex negotiation strategies. A randomized controlled trial of BP is necessary to determine the efficacy of the intervention and can lead to improved public health efforts at reducing HIV risk behavior among AAMSMW and in the African American community more generally. To evaluate the effect of the BP, we will recruit and enroll a cohort of 400 AAMSMW who will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition, in which they will be offered BP, or to the comparison condition, in which they will receive standardized HIV testing and counseling with referral to case management. We will follow the cohort over 9 months and will assess participants at three time points: baseline, 3 months follow-up, and 6 months follow- up.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to respond to the HIV epidemic in the African American community is a national public health priority. Men account for more than half of HIV infections among African Americans. We have worked diligently over the past four years to develop a HIV prevention intervention for African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW), the Bruthas Project. No controlled intervention studies to date have proven to be effective in significantly lowering HIV-related risk behavior for AAMSMW. Given the urgency of the epidemic among African Americans in general, and African American MSM in particular, a large scale randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to test the efficacy of this promising HIV prevention intervention for these men, and if it is found to be effective, to move it quickly into practice.           Narrative The need to respond to the HIV epidemic in the African American community is a national public health priority.

"Explaining Differences in HIV Prevalence and Incidence in Black and White MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stark differences in HIV prevalence and incidence between black and white MSM are well documented, but dozens of studies have shown that the differences in HIV prevalence are not attributable to higher levels of high risk sex, to higher numbers of sexual partners, or to more drug use among black MSM. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct studies to examine factors beyond individual-level risk behaviors (e.g., dyadic and network factors such as concurrency, and community-level factors such as neighborhood-level indicators of disease burden and poverty) and their relationship to HIV risk for black MSM. We propose a prospective cohort study of 340 HIV-negative black MSM and 340 white MSM, with baseline ascertainment and periodic re-ascertainment of individual-level, dyadic and network-level, and community-level factors to better describe the likely complex array of factors that give rise to disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence in black and white MSM. MSM will be recruited using a well- described method of venue-time-space sampling; we will administer an interview and HIV, STI, and drug testing at baseline, and then repeat both interview and testing at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Primary outcomes will be prevalence of HIV, STI and undiagnosed HIV infection, and incidence of HIV, a combined HIV/STI outcome, and unprotected anal intercourse. Information on network and recent partner characteristics will be collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Analyses will examine individual, dyadic and network, and community level factors associated with prevalent or incident outcomes. Our questionnaire will include theoretically-driven measures based on an ecological systems model, which will allow us to translate findings from our study into the development of future HIV prevention interventions for black and white MSM.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MSM continue to be the most heavily impacted group in the US HIV epidemic, and black MSM are disproportinately impacted by HIV as measured by HIV prevalence and incidence. Although MSM comprise nearly half of new annual HIV case reports in the US, only 10% of currently- available best-evidence HIV prevention interventions have been tested with MSM, and none has been tested with black MSM.           Relevance: MSM continue to be the most heavily impacted group in the US HIV epidemic, and black MSM are disproportinately impacted by HIV as measured by HIV prevalence and incidence.

"Strengths and Protective Factors Among Young Men who have Sex with Men (MSM)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic in the US is characterized by enormous demographic disparities, leaving certain sub- population to carry a disproportionate burden of disease. Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) have been particularly hard hit by this epidemic. The research and prevention efforts aimed at reducing transmission in this high risk population have been extensive. And while these efforts have resulted in marked behavior change on the level of the individual participants, we have failed to affect the type of population level change that is necessary to slow the epidemic. In fact, recent CDC surveillance reports suggest that not only are rates of HIV infection among YMSM increasing, they are increasing at a higher rate than among any other risk group. Currently, prevention inteventions rely on a model that suggests that risk behaviors (depression, alcohol use, substance use) mediate the relationship between adversity (violence/victimization) and HIV sexual risk (unprotected anal intercourse). Therefore, HIV prevention interventions rely on diminishing risk in order to promote health. Resilience theory, on the other hand, suggests that the relationship between adversity and risk behaviors, and the relationship between risk behaviors and UAI can be buffered by strengths and protective factors. This project will utilize resilience theory to guide the investigation of strengths and protective factors that exist among YMSM. The short-term goal of the proposed project is to identify factors that protect against HIV sexual risk behaviors. The long term goal ofthe proposed project is to inform the development of youth HIV prevention interventions. With knowledge of protective factors, prevention specialists will be able to develop interventions that rely not only on diminishing risks, but also on promoting strengths. This two-fold approach may give prevention programs the extra potency to reverse the current trends in infection. The specific aims ofthis study are: 1) Using in-depth qualitative interviews, identify strengths and protective factors that help young MSM avoid HIV risk behaviors. 2) Using the strengths and protective factors identified in Aim 1, develop a survey instrument that can be used to measure the Protective Factors construct of the resilience model. 3) Using mediation and moderation analysis test the resilience model in a sample of 200 young MSM aged 16 to 21. This project will contribute to the field of public health by addressing a current gap in our understanding of HIV prevention among youths. The information gained from this project will inform much-needed interventions to address significant health disparities in a highly vulnerable and understudied population.           ",Strengths and Protective Factors Among Young Men who have Sex with Men (MSM),8005534,F31MH087238,"['Buffers ', ' Victimization ', ' Participant ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' behavior change ', ' aged ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' psychosocial ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' peer ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' trend ', ' Prevention Research ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk ', ' Individual ', ' Investigation ', ' Sampling ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Prevention program ', ' Social isolation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Infection ', ' Affect ', ' high risk ', ' Health ', ' Mediating ', ' Knowledge ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Goals ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Address ', ' Prevention ', ' Interview ', ' Family ', ' Testing ', ' theories ', ' Left ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' resilience ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2011,8930,0.03031076151263291
"Culturally Relevant HIV Prevention for High-Risk Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth with a female identity) are an understudied group with HIV prevalence rates in the range of 22 - 66%. Public health intervention research has produced no theory-driven, evidence-based interventions for transgender women. The unique cultural context of transgender women creates distinct risk factors that require systematic investigation and then integration into culturally relevant, community-based approaches to intervention. This K08 application describes a comprehensive, integrated training and research plan designed to serve as a pathway to scientific independence and the expertise to develop and test an innovative and urgently needed intervention to improve health outcomes among a highly marginalized population disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The following training objectives are proposed: (1) to acquire expertise in the evaluation and application of theories of behavior change to marginalized populations; (2) to enhance skills in the use of mixed methods data collection and analysis, with an emphasis on techniques relevant to measurement development and theory testing; (3) to gain knowledge and experience with clinical trails methodology, including issues of sampling, randomization, design, protocol development, and ethics; and (4) to obtain training and experience in methods for developing, implementing, and evaluating culturally grounded, theory-driven HIV prevention interventions for transgender women. The specific research aims of the mentored original research are: (1) to describe the role of transgender women's unique cultural context on their HIV-related risk and protective factors; (2) to create new and to adapt existing quantitative measures to more accurately assess psychological dimension sand behavior relevant to transgender women's HIV risk and protective factors; (3) to identify psychosocial factors associated with HIV-related sexual and injection risk behaviors and protective factors among transgender women; and (4) to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-driven, culturally grounded HIV prevention intervention for transgender women.          ",Culturally Relevant HIV Prevention for High-Risk Women,8010634,K08MH085566,"['efficacy testing ', ' Stigmata ', ' behavior change ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' transgender ', ' transsexual ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' psychosocial ', ' Color ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Silicon Dioxide ', ' Tridymite ', ' Silica ', ' Sand ', ' Cristobalite ', ' protocol development ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Woman ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Prevalence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Respondent ', ' skills ', ' Investigation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Sampling ', ' Behavior ', ' Female ', ' Evaluation ', ' Literature ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Techniques ', ' Mentors ', ' Epidemic ', ' male ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Measurement ', ' Knowledge ', ' Health ', ' Research ', ' Affect ', ' Measures ', ' Testing ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Goals ', ' Training ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Foundations ', ' Dimensions ', ' Address ', ' Interview ', ' Outcome ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Clinical ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' Risk ', ' Methods ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Population ', ' theories ', ' high risk ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data ', ' base ', ' tool ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Research Training ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2011,168644,0.03201045507752648
"Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS. These disparities have not been adequately explained by individual level factors. Much of the HIV behavioral research to date has focused on measuring specific risk events without consideration of the social, geographic (ie. spatial) and temporal context of these events. Temporal and spatial dimensions are pertinent to the study of same sex behavior, particularly among AA MSM, who experience high levels of stigmatization and discrimination. Social networks have been found to be powerful influences on individuals' behaviors, through processes of social comparison, social monitoring and norm formation. However, what is less understood are the ways in which social networks are also shaped by time and geography. There has been little study of these dimensions as they relate to HIV risk and prevention, especially among AA MSM. The K01 Career Development award will allow me to undertake an interdisciplinary program of study and research concerning the temporal and spatial dimensions of social networks and how these influence HIV risk behavior, specifically among AA MSM. This training will result in my acquisition of knowledge and skills in geography and qualitative methodology to complement my existing research, with the goal of better informing the development of culturally appropriate interventions. Specifically, I will gain: 1) knowledge about concepts and methodologies from the subdisciplines time- geography, cultural geography and health geography as they apply to the study of social networks and HIV, 2) training in time-geography methodology to collect data about HIV risk behavior as it occurs within the context of social networks, place and time, 3) training in observational ethnographic methods, 4) skills in qualitative data analysis and, 5) intensive mentoring and guidance to integrate the training and research with my current research such that I can seek funding as an independent scientist and advance the field of HIV prevention science. One of the primary outcomes of this training will include development of a conceptual model that social scientists can use to design future interventions and studies which incorporates the spatial and temporal dimensions of social networks and HIV risk behavior. This model will serve as a basis for developing a larger R01 level study of AA MSM and HIV risk and development and evaluation of an accompanying HIV prevention behavioral intervention. Furthermore, the research and training from the award will result in scientific publications that will advance the field of HIV prevention and behavioral science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is an interdisciplinary approach to understand the socio-spatial and temporal context of HIV risk behavior among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). Results from this study will identify new conceptual pathways about HIV risk that can inform the development of sustainable culturally- relevant behavioral interventions and policies which bolster preventive behavior within various social contexts and reduce racial disparities in HIV among MSM.           This research is an interdisciplinary approach to understand the socio-spatial and temporal context of HIV risk behavior among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM).

"Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this sequential mixed methods research is to adapt and test a culturally appropriate and effective peer group intervention for HIV prevention specifically for couples in Malawi. Married couples are at risk for HIV infection due to unprotected sex either before or after marriage, and a growing number of couples face the issue of discordant HIV status. However, no current HIV prevention interventions specifically address the unique HIV prevention needs of couples. Gender inequality has long been recognized as a barrier to HIV prevention for married couples, especially the wives. However, the Pi's recent dissertation research has found that the actual decision-making of couples in rural Malawi is more complex than a simple script where the husband always dominates. Couples used husband-dominant cultural scripts, but they also used three other cultural scripts to support shared decision-making: communicating openly, maintaining harmony, and children's welfare. Most couples used a mix of husband-dominated, wife dominated, and shared decision-making. In Phase I. these well-accepted cultural scripts and the shared decision-making style already widely used by couples will be integrated into an existing peer group intervention already used successfully in Malawi. This Couples Peer Group Intervention will be tailored for the needs of married couples. Measures of couple- specific outcomes will also be developed. In Phase II. the intervention will be piloted. A process evaluation will document fidelity, acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. An outcomes evaluation of short-term impacts of the intervention for married couples receiving the intervention compared to a delayed control group, using a pretest and a posttest at three months. The study will be conducted in four low income rural communities in two districts, one with a matrilineal and one with a patrilineal marriage system. Hypotheses will be tested using binomial tests of proportions for binary outcomes and analysis of variance with contrasts for continuous variables. Any baseline differences will be controlled for. We will recruit a total of 120 couples per group at baseline, and with an 80% retention rate the final sample will be at least 96 couples per group. With alpha=.05 this sample will give adequate power (.80) to identify an effect size of .35 for continuous variables (a medium effect). The proposed research is an innovative scientific advance that will integrate culturally appropriate couple decision-making cultural scripts and shared decision-making styles with peer group intervention based on behavioral change theory. The community-based participatory research and examination of both individual-level and couple-level outcomes is also innovative. An acceptable and effective HIV prevention for married couples will have high significance for global HIV prevention.           ",Testing Culturally Tailored Peer Groups for HIV Prevention for Couples in Malawi,8116630,R01TW007965,"['Wife ', ' Rural ', ' post intervention ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Abstinence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Trust ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Couples ', ' Prevention program ', ' School Teachers ', ' health care model ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' African ', ' Attitude ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Friends ', ' group intervention ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Decision Making ', ' Resolution ', ' behavior change ', ' cost ', ' Country ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Communication ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Phase ', ' Woman ', ' theories ', ' Leadership ', ' Outcome ', ' member ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Series ', ' condoms ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Measures ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Collaborations ', ' base ', ' Control Groups ', ' Health ', ' Research ', ' Individual ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Reporting ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Address ', ' Sampling ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Goals ', ' Low income ', ' Modeling ', ' Testing ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' Interview ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Nature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Behavior ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Communities ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Risk ', ' Evaluation ', ' Gender ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Complex ', ' Process ', ' Prevention ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Sexuality ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Inequality ', ' Marriage ', ' Husband ', ' Primary Schools ', ' shared decision making ', ' Malawi ', ' Nyasaland ', ' sexually active ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Rural Community ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Peer Group ', ' Community Workers ', ' safer sex ', ' Action Research ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF MALAWI,R01,2011,50252,0.0666914937717333
"Post exposure prophylaxis among IDU syringe customers-Pharmacy pilot intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this research is to evaluate a structural pilot intervention which aims to expand pharmacy services to include provision of non-occupational HIV post exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and risk reduction information to injection drug users (IDUs) who buy syringes at two pharmacies registered with the New York State Expanded Syringe Access Program (ESAP), a program allowing pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription to help reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs. PEP is the standard of care for health care workers who experience an accidental needle stick. The probability of HIV transmission in IDUs through sharing syringes is either similar to or higher than the risk of an occupational needle stick, which supports the use of nPEP in these cases. There is a preponderance of data supporting PEP (i.e., antiretroviral therapy) as an effective strategy to prevent HIV infection. Thus, PEP is recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in non-occupational cases (exposure via high risk sex or injection behavior) when the exposure source is HIV positive or when the source is unknown but from a HIV prevalent community (e15%). ESAP's success creates a new window of opportunity to offer nPEP as a medically-based HIV prevention approach to low-risk IDUs such as ESAP participants who mostly access sterile syringes but may have an unplanned exposure. By targeting pharmacies in low-income, black and Hispanic communities where HIV burden is highest, a pharmacy-based nPEP program has the potential to create a more comprehensive HIV prevention plan that addresses the long-standing problem of racial disparities in HIV/AIDS. Thus, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate a pharmacy-based nPEP program by comparing IDU syringe customers who would agree to pharmacy-based nPEP vs. those who would decline (in the event of an accidental exposure) with respect to demographics, risk behaviors, perceptions of health care access/needs among IDU syringe customers. Using a pre/post design targeted to syringe customers and their peers we will determine if IDUs/peers who receive nPEP information and risk reduction counseling are more likely to 1) have increased and accurate knowledge of nPEP as an HIV prevention strategy (over time), and 2) more frequently share accurate information about nPEP, risk reduction, and HIV prevention with peers (over time) with respect to baseline demographics, risk behavior, and healthcare needs and access (Aim 2). Among those request nPEP and eligible (i.e., low injection/sex risk IDUs) we will assess side effects and nPEP adherence, risk behavior, social networks, and attitudes and opinions about nPEP via clinical follow up. We will conduct key- informant interviews among key stakeholders (n=15) and enroll IDU syringe customers (and referred peers) from pharmacies providing nPEP information/risk reduction counseling via print materials and video followed by a baseline A-CASI survey (n=638). A peer-driven intervention component will facilitate recruitment and dissemination of nPEP information. Participants will return in 3-months to assess behavior, knowledge, and spread of nPEP information. Analysis will include standard qualitative and quantitative regression techniques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is highly significant and innovative in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV prevention for injection drug users (IDUs), namely pharmacies participating in a nonprescription syringe sales program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access among IDUs in New York City (NYC). This new HIV prevention strategy adds a medical model to the current HIV prevention strategy. This new strategy includes delivery of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in non-occupational situations such as following injection or sexual exposure to HIV which has been recommended by CDC and evaluated among men who have sex with men but never before among IDUs. Our goal is to specifically tackle HIV racial disparities by targeting our pilot intervention to the black and Hispanic communities most heavily burdened with HIV/AIDS. Building on years of IDU and pharmacy-based research, we have selected two public health-minded pharmacies with a sizable and consistent IDU syringe purchasing customer base as the initial PEP delivery venue (as opposed to a visit to a medical setting to obtain a prescription) since IDUs typically experience challenges in accessing care. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only throughout other high-risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other cities and states where similar pharmacy syringe access programs exist. Broader public health impact could also follow, for example, pharmacists can partner with clinicians and other health care providers, including community based organizations to offer these expanded services to groups with limited access to health care services.           NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly significant and innovative in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV prevention for injection drug users (IDUs), namely pharmacies participating in a nonprescription syringe sales program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access among IDUs in New York City (NYC).

"NATIONAL HIV BEHAVIORAL SURVEILLANCE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirty years into the HIV/AIDS epidemic evidence based prevention strategies remain critical to implement an effective public health response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Effective prevention modalities implemented to scale have shown progress in slowing the spread of the disease within communities, but the work is not complete. Nowhere is this more evident than in the District of Columbia, where 3.2% of the population is diagnosed and living with HIV. At the end of 2008, there were 16,513 District residents living with   HIV/AIDS, of whom 72.0% were male and 75.6% were Black. Dubbed a ""Modem Epidemic,"" Washington, DC (DC) has concentrated epidemics among injecting drug users (IDU) and men who have sex with men (MSM), alongside a generalized epidemic among all District residents (3.2%). There is also evidence of striking disparities: 7.6% of people ages 40 to 49, 7.1% of black males, and 2.8% of black women in DC are living with HIV/AIDS. Among heterosexual communities at high risk, the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system collected data on a community-based sample and found 5.2% of all participants, and as many as 6.3% of women, were HIV-positive. This proposal represents a continuation of the Public Health-Academic Partnership (established: 2006) between the District of Columbia, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, and TB Bureau (HAHSTA) and the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics (GW). Through this Partnership, and in collaboration with the community at large, NHBS has been successfully completed for each cycle it has undertaken FMSM (N=543). IDU (N=553). HET (N=825)1. This has allowed the District to use NHBS data to drive changes in HIV prevention policies and programs, including directing resources to scale up a comprehensive, evidence based, HIV prevention portfolio, shifting service paradigms locally, and working collaboratively with individual insurers, the public health system, community partners, and academia to slow the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Nation's capital. The purpose of the NHBS system is to examine the prevalence of risk behaviors antecedent to acquisition of HIV in a population-based representative sample of individuals at high risk in areas with elevated HIV/AIDS rates. NHBS provides an improved understanding of behavioral risk factors, utilization of local prevention services and methods to reach the population in need of testing and care. NHBS also offers an estimate of what is happening among people not accessing HIV prevention or care settings: it allows insight into the depth of the epidemic among largely hidden populations that often wish to remain hidden. In this way, NHBS is essential in DC, as the local public health infrastructure grapples with a profound epidemic among people that are not always easily reached. In the proposed NHBS study in DC, five serial cross-sectional studies will be conducted, each year focusing on a specific population at high risk: men who have sex with men (MSM-3/4), injecting drug users (IDU-3/4), and heterosexuals at risk for HIV infection (HET-3). We also propose conducting additional modules to collect Hepatitis B, C, and syphilis data during each cycle, a respondent driven sample (RDS) of transgender male-to-females (MTF) during MSM-3, and evaluation of new HIV testing technologies in MSM-3. Through the partnership, HAHSTA has had demonstrated success in implementing NHBS with complete and on-time accrual each year, using RDS among IDU and heterosexuals, and venue based sampling (VBS) among MSM in partnership with a strong local academic institution. In this proposal, we outline plans to undertake the next five cycles, and three additional new objectives, with the highest regard for human subjects and surveillance data protection, community involvement, and scientific rigor in implementation and data dissemination. In addition to meeting past survey accrual goals, the Partnership has had other accomplishments of public health importance that will continue: these include collaboration with and dissemination to the local community planning groups (CPG), a well-defined GW Research Community Advisory Board with over 70 listed members, collaboration with multiple HAHSTA and GW Acuity and staff, and a unique opportunity for the training and development of the next generation of public health professionals.          ",NATIONAL HIV BEHAVIORAL SURVEILLANCE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,8129298,U1BPS003261,[''],NCHHSTP,DC DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH,U1B,2011,618621,0.035125952548955196
"Developing and Implementing a Cancer Prevention and Control Research Curriculum t    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop and execute a cancer prevention and control curriculum training program at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) that will help prepare professional students in public health and in the biomedical sciences for positions in cancer prevention and control research. The curriculum will be based on a framework for addressing cancer prevention and control from bench to bedside to community and will emphasize research targeted at reduction and elimination of cancer disparities. It will include courses that will provide the students with a suitable knowledge base in the areas of cancer epidemiology and cancer prevention and control and that will teach them how to do research in cancer prevention and control and to develop interventions to reduce disparities; practicum experiences designed to enhance the understanding and application of knowledge and research findings in cancer prevention and control to public health settings by providing an opportunity to gain practical experience, at an appropriate level and content, in the field of cancer prevention and control; and opportunities to conduct research in cancer prevention and control under the guidance of cancer researchers. The faculty of this training program will be drawn from the various graduate teaching programs at MSM, thereby integrating it into MSM training programs. The curriculum will be developed in year one, and it will be offered to students in MSM's Master of Public Health, Master of Science in Clinical Research, Doctor of Medicine and Minority Summer Public Health Fellowship programs. An evaluation plan will be implemented to constantly monitor the program and assess its success in achieving its goals and objectives, and the results will be used for ongoing improvement.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a tremendous need in the US to increase the number of minority scientists, particularly in academic medicine. Although African Americans suffer from major health disparities, less than 1% of investigator-initiated grant dollars go to Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCU) and less than 1% of R01-funded research is awarded to African American researchers. This R25 grant will help to ensure that investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), an HBCU, can play a major role in cancer research by creating a cadre of public health and health care professionals at MSM who have an increased capacity to describe health disparities related to cancer and associated mechanisms over time and across the cancer continuum, and by strengthening the skills and level of competence of MSM graduates in preparation for their inclusion in the public health workforce in the field of cancer prevention and control.          Project Narrative  There is a tremendous need in the US to increase the number of minority scientists,  particularly in academic medicine.

"STAR-Seek, Test and Retain. Linkages for Black HIV+, Substance Using MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic in the United States most severely affects men who have sex with men (MSM): 57% of all new infections occur in this population. Black MSM bear a disproportionate burden, with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV testing less frequently than other MSM; are less likely to be aware that they are HIV infected; are more likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care; and are less likely to be prescribed ART when eligible. These disparities are pronounced in substance using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis and delayed engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM behavior and high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this population, even as the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches 50%. Reducing HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS Strategy priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the US. Setting: The study will seek and recruit substance-using Black MSM in New York City for HIV testing and will link and retain those who are HIV-infected in HIV primary care. Study Aims: In response to the urgent public health need to seek substance-using Black MSM, identify those with HIV infection, and link the latter to HIV services, the study aims are as follows: Seek and Test: Respondent driven sampling (RDS) will be used to recruit substance-using Black MSM for HIV testing. RDS has been used in HIV surveillance among hard-to-reach populations and, to a limited extent, as a strategy for engaging hard-to-reach populations in services. We will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS to seek, recruit, and offer HIV testing to this high-risk population. Link and Retain: Participants with reactive rapid HIV test results and who are not currently in care will be randomized to two linkage and retention strategies: patient navigation (PN) and financial incentives (FI). One hundred participants will be randomized into each arm of the study. The primary objectives are: 1) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS for seeking and recruiting substance-using Black MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition for rapid HIV counseling and testing; 2) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using two interventions, PN and FI, for linkage and retention in HIV care; and 3) to assess the cost-effectiveness of PN and FI for linkage and retention in HIV care. This study has the potential to identify effective methods to seek and test substance-using Black MSM, to link the HIV infected to services, and to retain them in care and treatment. The success of such an effort responds to priorities with the national HIV strategy. Results will inform innovative approaches to engaging highest-risk, difficult-to-reach individuals in HIV counseling and testing and retaining them in care and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will test the feasibility of an innovative method to recruit substance-using African-American men who have sex with men into counseling and testing for HIV, and for those who are found to be HIV-infected, into one of two interventions to facilitate retention in HIV care. These two interventions are: peer navigation and financial incentives. This project has the potential to increase timely diagnosis of HIV and retention in HIV primary care among populations disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US, and most burdened by multiple barriers to appropriate care.           The proposed project will test the feasibility of an innovative method to recruit substance-using African-American men who have sex with men into counseling and testing for HIV, and for those who are found to be HIV-infected, into one of two interventions to facilitate retention in HIV care.

"Couples-Based HIV/STI Prevention for Drug-Involved, African American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to rigorously test the efficacy of a couples-based HIV and sexually transmitted infection (HIV/STI) preventive intervention for African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in same sex intimate relationships in which at least one partner is using stimulants (herein referred to as ""stimulant-using, African American MSM couples""). The proposed study is a logical progression from the investigative team's prior formative research to take an existing couples based intervention originally for heterosexual couples (""Connect"") and revise/tailor it for methamphetamine-using, African American MSM couples. The adapted intervention was pilot tested using a pre-/post-test design. Findings revealed statistically and clinically significant reductions in sexual and drug risk behaviors. In addition, this formative research informs the proposed study in several additional ways: (1) the importance of addressing stimulants beyond methamphetamine with African American MSM; (2) qualitative data on how a couples-based intervention can interrupt relationship dynamics more unique to drug-involved, African American MSM couples that lead to risk behavior; and (3) couples-based HIV prevention research is feasible, promising, and safe for stimulant using, African American MSM. This earlier research has culminated with a 7-session, manualized intervention entitled ""Connect 'n Unite"" (or CNU-pronounced ""seein' you""-for short) as a candidate couples-based HIV preventive intervention for stimulant-using, African American MSM couples. The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with 270 stimulant-using, African American MSM couples to test the impact of CNU versus a wellness promotion (WP) attention control condition on behavioral and biologically assayed outcomes over a 12-month follow-up period. The study has the following primary aims: (1) to test whether participants assigned to CNU engage in lower HIV/STI behavioral risk-fewer number of unprotected acts of anal intercourse, greater proportion of protected acts of anal intercourse, and fewer number of sexual partners-compared to participants assigned to WP; (2) to test whether participants assigned to CNU have lower cumulative incidence of STIs-chlamydia and gonorrhea-confirmed via biological assay compared to participants assigned to WP; and (3) to test whether participants assigned to CNU engage in less drug use and drug-related HIV risk (i.e., sex under the influence of drugs/alcohol) compared to participants assigned to WP. If successful, this study will advance the field by providing an evidence-based, innovative intervention that can be delivered in drug treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using, African American MSM.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses the overrepresentation of the African American/Black community among those living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. as well as men who have sex with men (MSM), the transmission category that accounts for the majority of HIV infections. In the absence of a vaccine or cure for HIV infection, behavioral risk reduction represents the best public health tool for prevention of HIV transmission. The proposed randomized clinical trial will rigorously test an innovative, couples-based intervention targeting the intersection of stimulant use and sexual risk behavior among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, with the ultimate goal providing an evidence-based intervention that can be delivered in drug treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using, African American/Black MSM.                    This study addresses the overrepresentation of the African American/Black community among those living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. as well as men who have sex with men (MSM), the transmission category that accounts for the majority of HIV infections.

"Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This mentored research project will investigate an under-researched aspect of HIV in Africa: the HIV prevention needs of female migrants. Migration and HIV research has almost exclusively focused on HIV risks to male migrants, often failing to measure the risks to women via their involvement in migration. Yet across the region, women's levels of participation in migration have met or exceeded those of men. Moreover, the few studies which have examined HIV risks to female migrants found higher risk behavior and HIV prevalence in migrant compared to non-migrant women. My dissertation study found that migration was associated with a higher risk of HIV infection in women than in men in South Africa. The finding warrants confirmation in East Africa, where HIV/AIDS is devastating communities and the sex disparity in infection risk is striking. HIV prevalence levels in Nyanza Province, Kenya are among the highest in Africa. Previous studies have found high levels of participation in migration by both men and women in Kenya and higher sexual risk behaviors among migrants than non-migrants. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which participation in migration leads to higher risk behavior in women. My proposed plan will address this gap. It is comprised of two phases: a secondary data analysis, and an in-depth qualitative study in Kenya. These two 'modules' will address the following aims: (1) Assess the degree to which HIV infection in women in Kenya is influenced by their participation in migration, and identify explanatory mechanisms by which women's migration may increase their HIV risks. I will use secondary data from Kenya Demographic and Health and AIDS Indicator Surveys and demographic surveillance field sites to carry out analyses to achieve this aim. Using 'HIV Triangulation', I will evaluate these findings along with information from other sources in participatory workshops with local stakeholders in Kenya. This exercise will inform the design of the qualitative study to be carried out in Aim 2: (2) Characterize social and psychological aspects of women's migration experience in Nyanza Province, Kenya which facilitate their risks of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. I will use participant observation and in-depth interviews to characterize the spatial and social features of the common destinations of female migrants, and identify the structural and psychological aspects of women's migration that influence their HIV infection risks. These antecedents to HIV infection in female migrants serve as potential points of HIV prevention intervention, thus laying the groundwork for Aim 3: (3) Develop a preliminary plan for a multi-level HIV prevention intervention with female migrants in Nyanza. In participatory workshops with local stakeholders, I will critically evaluate the cumulative findings of this research, identify potential points of intervention with female migrants, assess acceptability of various options, and develop a preliminary intervention plan. At the start of year 4 I will submit an R34 application to the NIMH for a formative study to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research proposed in this application examines the overlooked role that women's participation in migration may play in sustaining an enormous HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. This research will be significant because it will provide the first comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms through which migration increases HIV risk among women in the region. A better understanding of women's patterns of migration and mechanisms through which migration increases HIV risk is necessary both to improve our capacity to control HIV and to respond to future emerging infectious disease threats.                 The research proposed in this application examines the overlooked role that women's participation in migration may play in sustaining an enormous HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.

"A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research addresses a critical question for the future success of vaccine, microbicide, pre-exposure prophylaxis and other emerging HIV prevention technologies in the United States: How can we ensure that the community support and program capacity to evaluate and deliver new HIV prevention technologies are available where they are most needed? The research setting (Durham, NC) provides an ideal context to conduct research to address this question. The 5-year study will evaluate a systematic partnership-building approach for HIV prevention trial planning and implementation. The research aims are three-fold. AIM 1 is to implement and conduct a process evaluation of a systematic community-based participatory research model to build support for new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. This is accomplished through use of a conceptual framework that (1) integrates research with policy, community, behavior, and programs; (2) builds on community-based participatory research principles; (3) uses ethnography to generate empirical evidence to inform research design and provide a bridge between local residents, the research team, and other stakeholder groups; and (4) draws on group theory to refine the structure of stakeholder involvement and foster inclusiveness, creativity and active problem-solving. AIM 2 is to describe the communities and group affiliations that exist among young (ages 18-30) at-risk African Americans, and measure the relationship among experiences of discrimination, levels of trust, and support for new HIV prevention technologies in this population. AIM 3 is to identify priorities for evaluating and implementing new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. Research methods include participant observation, ethnographic mapping, focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and quantitative surveys. An HIV prevention technologies research literacy curriculum will be developed, implemented and evaluated; the evaluation will include an assessment of community attitudes toward research on specific HIV prevention technologies. Support for and feasibility of collaboration in conducting local research on new HIV prevention technologies will assessed with multiple stakeholder groups including researchers. Across all years a two-way process evaluation of the evolving community partnership will be undertaken. Sampling strategies include respondent-driven sampling for a community survey of young at-risk African Americans in Years 2 and 3; purposive sampling will be used for all other data collection activities. The results of all data collection activities will be presented to community partners and guidance solicited for next steps in evaluating and delivering new HIV prevention technologies.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience significant health disparities and this is especially evident with regard to HIV/AIDS in the U.S. South. Improving the capacity for HIV prevention trials in partnership with African American communities will lay the groundwork for moving effective interventions into successful prevention programs.          ",A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials,8084115,R01NR011232,"['Prevention program ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Community Surveys ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Address ', ' Ensure ', ' Future ', ' Sampling ', ' success ', ' United States ', ' Structure ', ' Collaborations ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Behavior ', ' Technology ', ' Trust ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Participant ', ' Risk ', ' Process ', ' Communities ', ' programs ', ' Vaccines ', ' improved ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research ', ' microbicide ', ' microbicidal ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Attitude ', ' public health relevance ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Data Collection ', ' Fostering ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Respondent ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' Policies ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measures ', ' Maps ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Population ', ' effective intervention ', ' theories ', ' Age ', ' experience ', ' Modeling ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' Group Affiliation ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Creativeness ', ' creativity ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' literacy ', ' ']",NINR,FAMILY HEALTH INTERNATIONAL,R01,2011,492582,0.08736021817137091
"'REALITY CHECK' IN TRANSIT: Evaluation of a Serial Drama for Black Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to evaluate an already-created serial drama intervention, ""Reality Check,"" on public buses in Los Angeles, CA. Young African Americans are very disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Social factors affecting their risk include poverty, poor access to preventive medical services, and homophobia, which causes some men who have sex with men (MSM) to be secretive about these activities and to be reluctant to be tested for HIV. Unfortunately, many of those infected with HIV are unaware of their infection and may be transmitting it, especially during the highly infectious acute infection stage. On the other hand, those who test positive reduce their risk-related behavior dramatically. Thus, the CDC has recommended universal HIV testing, but especially testing among those at highest risk. Accordingly, the broad, long-term objective of this application is to increase HIV testing among young African Americans. It proposes a pilot test of the effects of an innovative, theory-based HIV risk-reduction serial drama intervention, ""Reality Check,"" among African Americans aged 14 to 24 years who ride public buses in impoverished African American neighborhoods in Los Angeles. ""Reality Check"" is a structural intervention in that it will be implemented in the natural environment of bus riders. It consists of 27 3-minute episodes. Each episode will be shown for 1 week on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, once each hour, on all public buses in Los Angeles, which are equipped with video screens. Previously shown episodes will be available on a YouTube link from Transit TV's website. The study will use a quasi-experimental control group design with pre- and multiple post-intervention assessments. Riders of public buses in impoverished African American neighborhoods in Richmond, CA, will serve as the control. Cross-sectional anonymous bus stop surveys of African American youth aged 14-24 who ride the bus through-and reside in--designated impoverished areas of both cities at least 3 times each week will be conducted before ""Reality Check"" is shown in Los Angeles, immediately after it is shown, and 3 and 6 months after it is shown. The study sample will include 200 youth who exit buses in each of the 2 cities at each of the 4 assessment points, for a total of 1,600 participants. Using a systematic sampling strategy based on the target population's times of highest ridership, data will be collected in private spaces near the bus stops from youth who exit the buses and recorded on hand-held mobile phones. The Specific Aims include conducting a pilot test of the effects of ""Reality Check"" in increasing HIV testing (the primary outcome), theoretical mediators of testing, condom use, and abstinence, and reducing homophobia and HIV/AIDS stigma, as compared with control. Effects on HIV testing rates in treatment versus control city also will be examined. This research would provide preliminary evidence of the effects of an intervention that could be disseminated very cost-effectively, with substantial reach via public buses in 4 additional cities where TEZO Systems Unlimited, Inc., the company that owns Transit TV, plans to broadcast.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young African Americans are highly disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study evaluates the effectiveness of a serial drama, delivered on local buses, at changing attitudes and/or behaviors among young African Americans. This research responds to the urgent public health need for structural interventions to reduce the risk of STIs, including HIV, in young African Americans.           Young African Americans are highly disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

"Sexual Networks, Drugs, and HIV Risk among Men Who Have Sex With Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K01 award will provide Dr. Hong Van Tieu with the necessary training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in HIV epidemiology and prevention. Her short-term goals are to expand her experience in HIV epidemiology and prevention research among men who have sex with men (MSM), gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics, social network analysis, and qualitative research, and further the understanding of the influence of sexual networks on HIV and sexual risk behaviors among Black and White MSM. She will receive specialized training in the epidemiology of substance use and its relationship to HIV risk among MSM. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team has expertise in HIV and substance use epidemiology, prevention, and clinical research and strong track records of supporting junior faculty to become independently funded investigators. The New York Blood Center has a long history of conducting HIV epidemiology and behavioral and biomedical prevention research among MSM and is profoundly committed to the success of this K01 award. The dramatically disproportionate HIV infection rates among Black MSM in the U.S remain unexplained by differences in individual behavioral risk. One hypothesis is that the characteristics of sexual networks of Black MSM place them at increased risk of HIV compared to non-Black MSM. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM and to examine the relationship of their network characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors using an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The proposed research will enroll a large sample of Black and White MSM (n=878) in New York City as a substudy of an NIH R01-funded study to evaluate the hypothesis that certain structural (e.g., network size, density, partner concurrency) and compositional (e.g., assortative and disassortative mixing, durability of relationships) characteristics of Black MSM sexual networks increase the men's risk of HIV infection. The specific aims of this study are the following: (1) to describe and compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, (2) to compare the association of structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks with HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, and determine whether differences in sexual network characteristics explain the disparity in HIV prevalence between Black and White MSM, and (3) to explore in depth the contexts and meanings of sexual partnerships and networks by evaluating how Black and White MSM subjectively experience their sexual networks and perceive them to influence their sexual risk behaviors using qualitative research methods. A focus of the research is on drug and alcohol use within sexual networks and their relationship to HIV risk among MSM. This research will provide critically important information on the sexual networks of Black MSM to explain the alarming rates of HIV infection among this population and to inform development and testing of sexual network-based intervention strategies to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission risk. It will also serve as an excellent platform for the candidate to gain essential training in HIV epidemiology and prevention research and generate innovative ideas for her first R01 grant application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the structure and make-up of sexual networks (connections between sexual partners) among Black and White men who have sex with men in New York City and assess the relationship of these characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors.

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed investigation seeks to explore the relationship between interpersonal communication about HIV prevention and HIV testing intentions among adult Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) of their social networks (ages 18-64) in the New York City area. We will conduct a cross-sectional formative research study, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, guided by the following primary aims: 1) to determine the content and contexts of messages being disseminated about HIV prevention strategies and HIV testing among adult NYC-based BMSM and their social networks; and 2) to assess the relationship between interpersonal HIV prevention communication and intent to receive an HIV test among BMSM and their social networks. Secondary aims of the study include: a) to determine how BMSM and other MSM in their social networks diffuse messages about HIV prevention and HIV testing within their social networks; b) to determine what methods and venues for HIV testing are preferred by BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; c) to determine what barriers and facilitators to HIV testing exist among BMSM and other MSM of their social networks; d) to assess how specific psychosocial and behavioral variables (i.e., sexual identity, drug use, unsafe sex, gay-related stigma, HIV-related stigma, gay community attachment, and ethnic community attachment) relate to message diffusion methods as well as HIV testing preferences; and, e) to determine intent to receive HIV testing. Theoretical framework for this study is based primarily on the theory of reasoned action and secondarily on the diffusion of innovation theory. To achieve these aims, we will recruit a total of 300 BMSM and other MSM in their social networks. One hundred (100) BMSM are being recruited via active and passive recruitment methods at specific venues and special community events. These 100 BMSM will then recruit 200 other MSM from within their social networks to participate in the study (i.e., respondent- driven sampling). Data analyses will utilize multivariate analysis techniques (i.e., regression analyses, logistic regression) to determine the power and strength of relationships between interpersonal communication and HIV testing intention variables. Quantitative assessments will be administered via Audio-CASI; qualitative assessments will be administered via structured personal interviews. Mixed-methods strategies simultaneously examining the qualitative and quantitative data will be utilized to explore components of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) framework of the study as well as the content and contexts of HIV prevention through interpersonal communication. Results from this study will facilitate a better understanding about the specific messages being conveyed about HIV prevention and HIV testing between Black men who have sex with men and their friends, peers and sexual partners. Findings will also provide information on how this type of interpersonal communication may relate to behavioral intentions to test for HIV. Information from this study will help inform HIV prevention and testing efforts as well as social marketing and clinical interventions created in response to reducing health disparities as outlined by the Healthy People 2010 objectives and the recent CDC document entitled, A Heightened National Response to the HIV/AIDS Crisis Among African Americans.

"Social Determinants of HIV Risk and Vulnerability among Black MSM in South Africa Background: Until recently, the existence of HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub- Saharan Africa has been overlooked. Much current public health research has highlighted an epidemiological blind spot regarding hidden HIV epidemics among MSM in sub-Saharan Africa, and specifically in South Africa. These studies indicate that HIV risk among MSM is structured by social and economic inequalities as well as a deeply stigmatizing and discriminatory social context regarding same-sex practices, particularly among black MSM. This study will examine the social structuring of HIV risk and vulnerability among black MSM populations in order to contribute to the development of effective HIV prevention interventions among these groups. It will conduct this research in two specific settings: 1) a public health-focused sexual health promotion program (based in Johannesburg, South Africa); and 2) an antiretroviral (ARV) chemoprophylaxis HIV prevention clinical trial (based in Cape Town, South Africa). Aims: The specific aims of the study are: 1) to describe the key social and cultural determinants that structure HIV risk and vulnerability among black MSM in urban South Africa; 2) to understand how the social and cultural differences among MSM populations in South Africa, particularly with regard to race and gendered sex roles (e.g., masculine/active and feminine/passive), affect perceptions of HIV risk and influence high-risk sexual practices; and 3) to understand and compare how public health-focused health promotion versus antiretroviral chemoprohylaxis approaches to HIV prevention address various structural barriers to HIV prevention among black MSM. Methods: To examine these issues, qualitative methods will be used to understand the social processes that structure HIV risk and vulnerability and mediate access to HIV prevention interventions. Data will be drawn from participant-observation, discourse analysis, 1- hour semi-structured key informant interviews will be conducted with 40 men from the two sites (20 men from each site; and 20 men from each of two groups: gay- and non-gay-identified MSM), and 1- to 3-hour life history interviews will be conducted with 12 men (6 from each site; and 6 from each of two groups: gay- and non-gay- identified MSM). Analysis: Data collected from interview transcripts, field notes taken during participant observations, and through discourse analysis of media reports, including posters, conversations, radio chat shows, pamphlets, television stories, and news clippings wil be subjected to a grounded theory approach to data analysis that is commonly used for qualitative and ethnographic data. The training program developed in this application will contribute to the applicant's need to develop expertise in ethnographic and qualitative research methodology and analysis in order to successfully complete his dissertation research and to obtain the necessary academic professionalization to become a highly successful academic researcher in the fields of public health and medical anthropology, and on the topics of HIV/AIDS and global health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An understanding of social factors is essential in order to design effective HIV prevention interventions and evaluate their efficacy. The findings of this research will have direct relevance for public health planning and policy initiatives that are currently taking shape in South Africa aimed at addressing the HIV epidemic among black MSM, as well as global public health concerns regarding the social and cultural aspects of implementing ARV chemoprophylaxis as a viable HIV prevention strategy among populations at high-risk for HIV infection.

"Post exposure prophylaxis among IDU syringe customers-Pharmacy pilot intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this research is to evaluate a structural pilot intervention which aims to expand pharmacy services to include provision of non-occupational HIV post exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and risk reduction information to injection drug users (IDUs) who buy syringes at two pharmacies registered with the New York State Expanded Syringe Access Program (ESAP), a program allowing pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription to help reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs. PEP is the standard of care for health care workers who experience an accidental needle stick. The probability of HIV transmission in IDUs through sharing syringes is either similar to or higher than the risk of an occupational needle stick, which supports the use of nPEP in these cases. There is a preponderance of data supporting PEP (i.e., antiretroviral therapy) as an effective strategy to prevent HIV infection. Thus, PEP is recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in non-occupational cases (exposure via high risk sex or injection behavior) when the exposure source is HIV positive or when the source is unknown but from a HIV prevalent community (e15%). ESAP's success creates a new window of opportunity to offer nPEP as a medically-based HIV prevention approach to low-risk IDUs such as ESAP participants who mostly access sterile syringes but may have an unplanned exposure. By targeting pharmacies in low-income, black and Hispanic communities where HIV burden is highest, a pharmacy-based nPEP program has the potential to create a more comprehensive HIV prevention plan that addresses the long-standing problem of racial disparities in HIV/AIDS. Thus, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate a pharmacy-based nPEP program by comparing IDU syringe customers who would agree to pharmacy-based nPEP vs. those who would decline (in the event of an accidental exposure) with respect to demographics, risk behaviors, perceptions of health care access/needs among IDU syringe customers. Using a pre/post design targeted to syringe customers and their peers we will determine if IDUs/peers who receive nPEP information and risk reduction counseling are more likely to 1) have increased and accurate knowledge of nPEP as an HIV prevention strategy (over time), and 2) more frequently share accurate information about nPEP, risk reduction, and HIV prevention with peers (over time) with respect to baseline demographics, risk behavior, and healthcare needs and access (Aim 2). Among those request nPEP and eligible (i.e., low injection/sex risk IDUs) we will assess side effects and nPEP adherence, risk behavior, social networks, and attitudes and opinions about nPEP via clinical follow up. We will conduct key- informant interviews among key stakeholders (n=15) and enroll IDU syringe customers (and referred peers) from pharmacies providing nPEP information/risk reduction counseling via print materials and video followed by a baseline A-CASI survey (n=638). A peer-driven intervention component will facilitate recruitment and dissemination of nPEP information. Participants will return in 3-months to assess behavior, knowledge, and spread of nPEP information. Analysis will include standard qualitative and quantitative regression techniques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is highly significant and innovative in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV prevention for injection drug users (IDUs), namely pharmacies participating in a nonprescription syringe sales program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access among IDUs in New York City (NYC). This new HIV prevention strategy adds a medical model to the current HIV prevention strategy. This new strategy includes delivery of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in non-occupational situations such as following injection or sexual exposure to HIV which has been recommended by CDC and evaluated among men who have sex with men but never before among IDUs. Our goal is to specifically tackle HIV racial disparities by targeting our pilot intervention to the black and Hispanic communities most heavily burdened with HIV/AIDS. Building on years of IDU and pharmacy-based research, we have selected two public health-minded pharmacies with a sizable and consistent IDU syringe purchasing customer base as the initial PEP delivery venue (as opposed to a visit to a medical setting to obtain a prescription) since IDUs typically experience challenges in accessing care. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only throughout other high-risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other cities and states where similar pharmacy syringe access programs exist. Broader public health impact could also follow, for example, pharmacists can partner with clinicians and other health care providers, including community based organizations to offer these expanded services to groups with limited access to health care services.

"A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Bruthas Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW) are at particular risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and represent a priority population for developing effective interventions. Despite the urgent need for effective prevention approaches for AAMSMW, to our knowledge no evidence-based HIV interventions have been developed and tested for this population. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of the Bruthas Project, an individual-level HIV prevention intervention, which builds on standardized HIV counseling and testing. Delivered in a series of four sessions by trained African American male counselors, the BP focuses on reviewing HIV transmission routes for male and female partners, strengthening sexual communication skills with both male and female partners, and improving condom use skills and other safer sex negotiation strategies. A randomized controlled trial of BP is necessary to determine the efficacy of the intervention and can lead to improved public health efforts at reducing HIV risk behavior among AAMSMW and in the African American community more generally. To evaluate the effect of the BP, we will recruit and enroll a cohort of 400 AAMSMW who will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition, in which they will be offered BP, or to the comparison condition, in which they will receive standardized HIV testing and counseling with referral to case management. We will follow the cohort over 9 months and will assess participants at three time points: baseline, 3 months follow-up, and 6 months follow- up.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to respond to the HIV epidemic in the African American community is a national public health priority. Men account for more than half of HIV infections among African Americans. We have worked diligently over the past four years to develop a HIV prevention intervention for African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW), the Bruthas Project. No controlled intervention studies to date have proven to be effective in significantly lowering HIV-related risk behavior for AAMSMW. Given the urgency of the epidemic among African Americans in general, and African American MSM in particular, a large scale randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to test the efficacy of this promising HIV prevention intervention for these men, and if it is found to be effective, to move it quickly into practice.

"'REALITY CHECK' IN TRANSIT: Evaluation of a Serial Drama for Black Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to evaluate an already-created serial drama intervention, ""Reality Check,"" on public buses in Los Angeles, CA. Young African Americans are very disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Social factors affecting their risk include poverty, poor access to preventive medical services, and homophobia, which causes some men who have sex with men (MSM) to be secretive about these activities and to be reluctant to be tested for HIV. Unfortunately, many of those infected with HIV are unaware of their infection and may be transmitting it, especially during the highly infectious acute infection stage. On the other hand, those who test positive reduce their risk-related behavior dramatically. Thus, the CDC has recommended universal HIV testing, but especially testing among those at highest risk. Accordingly, the broad, long-term objective of this application is to increase HIV testing among young African Americans. It proposes a pilot test of the effects of an innovative, theory-based HIV risk-reduction serial drama intervention, ""Reality Check,"" among African Americans aged 14 to 24 years who ride public buses in impoverished African American neighborhoods in Los Angeles. ""Reality Check"" is a structural intervention in that it will be implemented in the natural environment of bus riders. It consists of 27 3-minute episodes. Each episode will be shown for 1 week on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, once each hour, on all public buses in Los Angeles, which are equipped with video screens. Previously shown episodes will be available on a YouTube link from Transit TV's website. The study will use a quasi-experimental control group design with pre- and multiple post-intervention assessments. Riders of public buses in impoverished African American neighborhoods in Richmond, CA, will serve as the control. Cross-sectional anonymous bus stop surveys of African American youth aged 14-24 who ride the bus through-and reside in--designated impoverished areas of both cities at least 3 times each week will be conducted before ""Reality Check"" is shown in Los Angeles, immediately after it is shown, and 3 and 6 months after it is shown. The study sample will include 200 youth who exit buses in each of the 2 cities at each of the 4 assessment points, for a total of 1,600 participants. Using a systematic sampling strategy based on the target population's times of highest ridership, data will be collected in private spaces near the bus stops from youth who exit the buses and recorded on hand-held mobile phones. The Specific Aims include conducting a pilot test of the effects of ""Reality Check"" in increasing HIV testing (the primary outcome), theoretical mediators of testing, condom use, and abstinence, and reducing homophobia and HIV/AIDS stigma, as compared with control. Effects on HIV testing rates in treatment versus control city also will be examined. This research would provide preliminary evidence of the effects of an intervention that could be disseminated very cost-effectively, with substantial reach via public buses in 4 additional cities where TEZO Systems Unlimited, Inc., the company that owns Transit TV, plans to broadcast.        Young African Americans are highly disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study evaluates the effectiveness of a serial drama, delivered on local buses, at changing attitudes and/or behaviors among young African Americans. This research responds to the urgent public health need for structural interventions to reduce the risk of STIs, including HIV, in young African Americans.

"A Partnership Initiative for HIV Prevention Trials DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research addresses a critical question for the future success of vaccine, microbicide, pre-exposure prophylaxis and other emerging HIV prevention technologies in the United States: How can we ensure that the community support and program capacity to evaluate and deliver new HIV prevention technologies are available where they are most needed? The research setting (Durham, NC) provides an ideal context to conduct research to address this question. The 5-year study will evaluate a systematic partnership-building approach for HIV prevention trial planning and implementation. The research aims are three-fold. AIM 1 is to implement and conduct a process evaluation of a systematic community-based participatory research model to build support for new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. This is accomplished through use of a conceptual framework that (1) integrates research with policy, community, behavior, and programs; (2) builds on community-based participatory research principles; (3) uses ethnography to generate empirical evidence to inform research design and provide a bridge between local residents, the research team, and other stakeholder groups; and (4) draws on group theory to refine the structure of stakeholder involvement and foster inclusiveness, creativity and active problem-solving. AIM 2 is to describe the communities and group affiliations that exist among young (ages 18-30) at-risk African Americans, and measure the relationship among experiences of discrimination, levels of trust, and support for new HIV prevention technologies in this population. AIM 3 is to identify priorities for evaluating and implementing new HIV prevention technologies in the African American community. Research methods include participant observation, ethnographic mapping, focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and quantitative surveys. An HIV prevention technologies research literacy curriculum will be developed, implemented and evaluated; the evaluation will include an assessment of community attitudes toward research on specific HIV prevention technologies. Support for and feasibility of collaboration in conducting local research on new HIV prevention technologies will assessed with multiple stakeholder groups including researchers. Across all years a two-way process evaluation of the evolving community partnership will be undertaken. Sampling strategies include respondent-driven sampling for a community survey of young at-risk African Americans in Years 2 and 3; purposive sampling will be used for all other data collection activities. The results of all data collection activities will be presented to community partners and guidance solicited for next steps in evaluating and delivering new HIV prevention technologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience significant health disparities and this is especially evident with regard to HIV/AIDS in the U.S. South.

"Sexual Networks, Drugs, and HIV Risk among Men Who Have Sex With Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K01 award will provide Dr. Hong Van Tieu with the necessary training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in HIV epidemiology and prevention. Her short-term goals are to expand her experience in HIV epidemiology and prevention research among men who have sex with men (MSM), gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics, social network analysis, and qualitative research, and further the understanding of the influence of sexual networks on HIV and sexual risk behaviors among Black and White MSM. She will receive specialized training in the epidemiology of substance use and its relationship to HIV risk among MSM. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team has expertise in HIV and substance use epidemiology, prevention, and clinical research and strong track records of supporting junior faculty to become independently funded investigators. The New York Blood Center has a long history of conducting HIV epidemiology and behavioral and biomedical prevention research among MSM and is profoundly committed to the success of this K01 award. The dramatically disproportionate HIV infection rates among Black MSM in the U.S remain unexplained by differences in individual behavioral risk. One hypothesis is that the characteristics of sexual networks of Black MSM place them at increased risk of HIV compared to non-Black MSM. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM and to examine the relationship of their network characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors using an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The proposed research will enroll a large sample of Black and White MSM (n=878) in New York City as a substudy of an NIH R01-funded study to evaluate the hypothesis that certain structural (e.g., network size, density, partner concurrency) and compositional (e.g., assortative and disassortative mixing, durability of relationships) characteristics of Black MSM sexual networks increase the men's risk of HIV infection. The specific aims of this study are the following: (1) to describe and compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, (2) to compare the association of structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks with HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, and determine whether differences in sexual network characteristics explain the disparity in HIV prevalence between Black and White MSM, and (3) to explore in depth the contexts and meanings of sexual partnerships and networks by evaluating how Black and White MSM subjectively experience their sexual networks and perceive them to influence their sexual risk behaviors using qualitative research methods. A focus of the research is on drug and alcohol use within sexual networks and their relationship to HIV risk among MSM. This research will provide critically important information on the sexual networks of Black MSM to explain the alarming rates of HIV infection among this population and to inform development and testing of sexual network-based intervention strategies to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission risk. It will also serve as an excellent platform for the candidate to gain essential training in HIV epidemiology and prevention research and generate innovative ideas for her first R01 grant application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the structure and make-up of sexual networks (connections between sexual partners) among Black and White men who have sex with men in New York City and assess the relationship of these characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors. This study will have direct impact on the design of programs to reduce HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men.

"Pilot Intervention for Discrimination and Mistrust Among HIV Positive Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (MSM) bear the greatest burden of HIV across all races/ethnicities and risk groups, accounting for ~40% of diagnoses among MSM of all races/ethnicities, and one-third among all men. Compared to other races/ethnicities, Blacks living with HIV are less likely to be diagnosed, to be engaged in care, and to receive and adhere to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Black MSM in particular show very low ART adherence. In this 3-year intervention development study, we propose to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant intervention to reduce medical mistrust and address discrimination among Black MSM living with HIV. Our work with Black MSM suggests that culturally relevant factors such as perceived discrimination and HIV- related medical mistrust (e.g., HIV ""conspiracy beliefs,"" like ""HIV is a manmade virus"") contribute to disparities in HIV treatment behaviors, in some cases even more than factors known to be highly influential like depression and substance use. Black MSM living with HIV are at the nexus of 3 stigmatized social categories (HIV-serostatus, race, sexual orientation) from which they face discrimination, which in turn can lead to disparities by increasing detrimental stress responses related to poor self-control (maladaptive coping, poor health behaviors). Discrimination also fosters mistrust of public health entities, and suspicion of medical treatments. However, no interventions have been developed to overcome these culturally relevant barriers. In the proposed innovative community-based participatory research project, we will partner with a Black-MSM- serving AIDS service organization (ASO) with high success in engaging Black MSM in research. In Phase 1, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 Black MSM and 20 social service and mental health providers, and engage stakeholders in a community advisory process to obtain input on sustainable intervention components that can improve the effectiveness of service delivery. In Phase 2, we will conduct a process evaluation of one pilot intervention group of 10 participants, delivered via a community HIV support group. In Phase 3, we will conduct a small randomized pilot trial with 3 intervention groups and 3 control groups (10 participants each). The specific aims are to: 1. Conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with Black MSM, and engage AIDS service organization (ASO) staff and mental health counselors, in order to develop intervention modules that address mistrust and discrimination among Black MSM. 2. Examine whether the pilot intervention can reduce mistrust and improve coping responses to discrimination among Black MSM. 3. Explore pilot intervention effects on mental health, antiretroviral treatment adherence, and engagement in care among Black MSM. Our goal is for the proposed culturally relevant intervention to be exportable to interventions already developed for improving adherence and engagement in care among people living with HIV. If shown to be effective in future R01-funded research, our intervention will be flexible for use in community settings, such as in existing HIV support groups already being sustained throughout the US.          HIV-positive Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and Black MSM living with HIV have very low levels of treatment adherence and poor survival times compared to other groups. We propose to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant intervention for HIV-positive Black MSM to address mistrust and improve coping responses to discrimination - two factors that are related to poor health and health behavior in this population. Developing culturally relevant interventions is key to limiting the impact of discrimination and ultimately, narrowing disparities.

"Overcoming Health Disparities to HIV Testing for Deaf MSM through the Internet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-11-119 ""HIV/AIDS Testing and Follow-up among the Underserved in the United States"" (R21), which invites grant applications on populations experiencing ""unique barriers or facilitators to testing and linkage to care"". Deaf Men who have Sex with Men (D-MSM) are one such group, chronically excluded from HIV research, testing, surveillance, education and services. Data from Maryland, the only state to ask information about hearing status when screening for HIV, indicate that the prevalence of HIV in the general deaf and hard-of-hearing population is two to five times higher than for the hearing population. We expect the sub-set of D-MSM to be the highest risk group within the larger Deaf population. In 30 years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, no national studies of HIV testing rates, risk behavior, prevention and treatment needs of D-MSM have been conducted in the US, a chronic problem we begin to address in this application. Internet- based technology can enable us to reach D-MSM for HIV research, services and education. The long term objective of this research is to improve HIV screening, testing, prevention, treatment and access for Deaf people, by developing innovative, culturally- and linguistically-accessible, Internet-based methods and interventions. As a first step, in this R21, we will develop and test online, visually-based qualitative and quantitative research tools (integrating American Sign Language [ASL] and English), while also conducting the first HIV testing and prevention needs assessment of D-MSM in ASL. Integrating the theory of intersectionality and a social cognitive approach, the four aims of this R21 allow us to develop and test the online tools needed to create effective health screening interventions with Deaf populations. Through Aim 1 we will utilize qualitative online interviews in ASL to assess the experiences of a geographically dispersed group of D-MSM in HIV risk behavior, knowledge, barriers and facilitators to testing, and prevention needs. For Aim 2, we will develop the quantitative measures needed to assess the Deaf experience of seeking services, including new Deaf-specific measures. In Aim 3, we will develop and test the resulting online, visually-based survey tools in ASL-English, including an HIV risk screening instrument. Through Aim 4, we will conduct the first online ASL- based HIV needs assessment of D-MSM using a national sample. The public health impact of this study resides in the contribution to advancing research in overcoming health disparities, by developing a suite of online tools and services available nationally to facilitate access to health services for Deaf people, and their providers, thereby addressing the needs of a chronically underserved population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deaf MSM (D-MSM) are a high-risk, underserved population experiencing chronic barriers to HIV testing and linkage to care. The principal challenge is that HIV research, testing, counseling and services is typically provided in English, while D-MSM communicate primarily through American Sign Language (ASL) and have, on average, very low (3rd-4th grade) English reading levels. Because the population is geographically dispersed through the USA, most places lack resources to provide confidential HIV testing services in ASL. This R21 is a feasibility and acceptability test of how to use technology to overcome the chronic barriers experienced by D- MSM. We will design, develop and test online methods to engage a diverse national sample of D-MSM in a study of HIV screening and prevention needs, using a combined ASL-English dual format. We plan to develop a suite of online ASL-English tools for providers, researchers, and surveillance to use, thus enabling D-MSM to finally engage in HIV prevention and care.              Deaf MSM (D-MSM) are a high-risk, underserved population experiencing chronic barriers to HIV testing and linkage to care.

HIV infection has always taken a heavy toll on men who have sex with men (MSM) and also on African Americans. However, HIV incidence disparity is most striking of all for MSM who are also African American, a segment that probably accounts for less than one percent of the American population but fully 25% of all new HIV infections in the United States. Surprisingly, very few HIV prevention interventions designed for African American MSM have been undertaken, and most existing approaches have relied on individual or small-group risk reduction counseling. These existing models have limited cultural and practical suitability for reaching high-risk African American MSM who are hidden in the community and unlikely to seek out sexual risk reduction counseling. Interventions directed to individuals alone also do not attend sufficiently to the important influence played by social norms and social network factors on risk behavior. In contrast to individual counseling models, HIV prevention interventions that are directed to social networks of Black MSM in the community and that work through natural influence channels within these networks hold the potential for reaching deeply into hidden and vulnerable populations of African American MSM. Network-level HIV prevention interventions rely on oral communication traditions and cultural models appropriate in minority communities, and can strengthen social network normative support for risk reduction. Following a 1-year formative research phase that will provide data needed to contextualize the study's recruitment, assessment, and intervention content and delivery methods, we will undertake a social network-level intervention outcome trial in 3 cities: Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Miami. Project-wide, 24 sociocentric networks of African American MSM-each expected to be composed of approximately 40 people (total n=960 participants)-will be recruited. 12 of the networks (n=480 participants) will be randomized to a comparison condition and receive HIV/STD testing, treatment, and individual counseling. The other 12 networks (n=480) will receive the same counseling and testing and also a social network intervention that identifies, trains, and engages empirically-identified influence leaders of each network to deliver ongoing, theory-based, and culturally tailored HIV prevention advice, recommendations, and support to other network members. The study will determine the comparative effectiveness of the social network intervention to the counseling, testing, and treatment comparison condition on measures of sexual risk, substance use associated with sexual risk behavior, and STD/HIV incidence assessed with laboratory measures at 6- and 18-month followup points. The study aim is to develop and determine the efficacy of an intervention modality capable of reaching and preventing HIV among high-risk African American MSM in the community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 56,000 Americans continue to contract HIV each year, and African American MSM account for a far disproportionate number of incident infections. Public health efforts to reduce HIV incidence in the United States require the development of new prevention approaches delivered using modalities that can target and reach those population segments at greatest vulnerability. If successful, this research will identify an HIV prevention intervention approach, practical for public health service providers, that lends itself well to rapid uptake and use by CBOs, health departments, and minority organizations concerned about AIDS.

"Health,Hope and Healing:A National conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW Abstract  The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities and is on par with those found in several African countries. HIV directly or indirectly related to men having sex with men is the single largest contributor to HIV infection among Blacks, accounting for nearly half of all cases among Black men. Despite large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV prevalence and risk, just one tested intervention specifically for Black men who have sex with men (MSM) has been published. Furthermore, Black men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) have been particularly underserved and underrepresented in HIV research. Attention must be lent to address the behavioral, psychological, socio-cultural, and biomedical factors, as well as the racial/ethnic disparities that exist and contribute to HIV infection and transmission among Black MSM and MSMW. This 5-year R13 conference grant proposal entitled, Health, Hope and Healing (H3): A National Conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW, will assemble the best minds currently studying HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW. The H3 conference series, with an annual meeting over five years, aims to advance HIV biobehavioral research, mentor junior investigators, and foster community based participatory collaborations. The three measurable conference outcomes are to: 1) Produce an executive report detailing the long term research, training and policy agenda, highlighting recommendations designed to reduce HIV in Black MSM and MSMW; 2) Produce an executive report detailing successful mentorship of junior investigators; and 3) Develop successful community based participatory research collaboratives, as measured by the submission of at least one joint proposal that operationalizes the research. The H3 Conference series will be among the first to discuss the needs of Black MSM and MSMW within a holistic and socio-cultural paradigm and disseminate research findings and healthcare and policy recommendations for eliminating HIV/AIDS within this population. Project Narrative  The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities. Researchers, clinicians, community members and congressman have all advocated for more attention to this epidemic. The proposed Health, Hope and Healing conference will gather the best minds currently studying HIV among Black MSM and MSMW. This conference aims to advance research, mentor junior investigators, foster community based participatory collaborations and disseminate findings and recommendations for the purpose of eliminating HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW.","Health,Hope and Healing:A National conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW",8231486,R13MH089835,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Archives ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Videotape ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Healed ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Monograph ', ' programs ', ' fighting ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Manuscripts ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Measurable ', ' Research Training ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' healing ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' MSMW ', ' men who have sex with men and women ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R13,2012,49593,0.04421181200055216
"Structural barriers to HIV prevention service utilization among Black MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the District of Columbia (DC), where 3.2% of the population and 7.1% of black males are living with HIV, men having sex with men (MSM) remains the leading mode of transmission, accounting for 62% of all AIDS cases. Throughout the US, black MSM (BMSM) are most severely affected by the epidemic, representing an urgent public health crisis. Research done by Dr. Magnus and colleagues in DC corroborates findings of other studies that individual-level sexual behavior of BMSM is not alone responsible for the alarming rates of HIV/AIDS in this population. Structural barriers to HIV and sexual transmitted infection prevention and treatment, and general healthcare have been posited as correlates of the alarming HIV rates among BMSM and are poorly characterized. Previous data suggest that BMSM often receive culturally insensitive and alienating HIV prevention or care services, experience healthcare disparities, and have other unique structural barriers to care that have not been fully explored. While behavioral risk screening is generally performed for those engaging in high risk sex behavior should they access services, no validated, brief tool exists to rapidly and effectively screen for structural barriers to care. Despite recent advances in HIV prevention, including efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), treatment of the infected partner in a discordant pair (as found in HPTN 052), and current exploration of ""test and treat"" paradigms (HPTN 065), the new tools to prevent HIV are found primarily in clinics; as a result, they will be given to persons regularly and comfortably accessing care. For BMSM who experience structural or societal barriers to care, these men will not reap the benefits of prevention advances. Detailed information regarding these structural barriers to care is required in order to inform new interventions to meet the unique needs of the population of BMSM: it is clear that current biomedical and behavioral interventions will not be able to slow the HIV/AIDS epidemic among BMSM if we cannot overcome these barriers by altering the healthcare system paradigms that prevent people from seeking care. This study will use a mixed-method approach to systematically examine the role of structural barriers to prevention and care services among BMSM. The investigators will base novel instrumentation on the Dynamic Social Systems Model, looking beyond individual-level barriers to care and characterizing societal and structural ones. Upon completion of instrument development with N=45 men, qualitative and quantitative methods will be used on a sample of N=100 peer-referred BMSM to enable evaluation of the instrument's ability to screen for structural barriers to care, and the resultant new rapid assessment structural barrier questionnaire piloted for feasibility on N=30 additional men. Data from this study will be used to inform development of a structural intervention in future studies. Given that the overwhelming majority of new infections are among BMSM, identifying barriers to biomedical and behavioral prevention services is critical to meeting the National HIV/AIDS Strategy benchmarks for reduction in HIV in the US.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Structural barriers to biomedical and behavioral HIV prevention services exist among black men who have sex with men, but are poorly characterized, presenting challenges in slowing the epidemic among those at highest risk. Through development and use of a novel and effective screening instrument among 175 BMSM, this study will inform structural intervention development for BMSM.              Structural barriers to biomedical and behavioral HIV prevention services exist among black men who have sex with men, but are poorly characterized, presenting challenges in slowing the epidemic among those at highest risk.

"Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and HIV In the United States, African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS. These disparities have not been adequately explained by individual level factors. Much of the HIV behavioral research to date has focused on measuring specific risk events without consideration of the social, geographic (ie. spatial) and temporal context of these events. Temporal and spatial dimensions are pertinent to the study of same sex behavior, particularly among AA MSM, who experience high levels of stigmatization and discrimination. Social networks have been found to be powerful influences on individuals' behaviors, through processes of social comparison, social monitoring and norm formation. However, what is less understood are the ways in which social networks are also shaped by time and geography. There has been little study of these dimensions as they relate to HIV risk and prevention, especially among AA MSM. The K01 Career Development award will allow me to undertake an interdisciplinary program of study and research concerning the temporal and spatial dimensions of social networks and how these influence HIV risk behavior, specifically among AA MSM. This training will result in my acquisition of knowledge and skills in geography and qualitative methodology to complement my existing research, with the goal of better informing the development of culturally appropriate interventions. Specifically, I will gain: 1) knowledge about concepts and methodologies from the subdisciplines time-geography, cultural geography and health geography as they apply to the study of social networks and HIV, 2) training in time-geography methodology to collect data about HIV risk behavior as it occurs within the  context of social networks, place and time, 3) training in observational ethnographic methods, 4) skills in qualitative data analysis and, 5) intensive mentoring and guidance to integrate the training and research with my current research such that I can seek funding as an independent scientist and advance the field of HIV prevention science. One of the primary outcomes of this training will include development of a conceptual model that social scientists can use to design future interventions and studies which incorporates the spatial and temporal dimensions of social networks and HIV risk behavior. This model will serve as a basis for  developing a larger R01 level study of AA MSM and HIV risk and development and evaluation of an accompanying HIV prevention behavioral intervention. Furthermore, the research and training from the award will result in scientific publications that will advance the field of HIV prevention and behavioral science. This research is an interdisciplinary approach to understand the socio-spatial and temporal context of HIV risk behavior among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). Results from this study will identify new conceptual pathways about HIV risk that can inform the development of sustainable culturally-relevant behavioral interventions and policies which bolster preventive behavior within various social contexts and reduce racial disparities in HIV among MSM.","Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and

"STAR-Seek, Test and Retain. Linkages for Black HIV+, Substance Using MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic in the United States most severely affects men who have sex with men (MSM): 57% of all new infections occur in this population. Black MSM bear a disproportionate burden, with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV testing less frequently than other MSM; are less likely to be aware that they are HIV infected; are more likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care; and are less likely to be prescribed ART when eligible. These disparities are pronounced in substance using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis and delayed engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM behavior and high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this population, even as the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches 50%. Reducing HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS Strategy priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the US. Setting: The study will seek and recruit substance-using Black MSM in New York City for HIV testing and will link and retain those who are HIV-infected in HIV primary care. Study Aims: In response to the urgent public health need to seek substance-using Black MSM, identify those with HIV infection, and link the latter to HIV services, the study aims are as follows: Seek and Test: Respondent driven sampling (RDS) will be used to recruit substance-using Black MSM for HIV testing. RDS has been used in HIV surveillance among hard-to-reach populations and, to a limited extent, as a strategy for engaging hard-to-reach populations in services. We will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS to seek, recruit, and offer HIV testing to this high-risk population. Link and Retain: Participants with reactive rapid HIV test results and who are not currently in care will be randomized to two linkage and retention strategies: patient navigation (PN) and financial incentives (FI). One hundred participants will be randomized into each arm of the study. The primary objectives are: 1) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS for seeking and recruiting substance-using Black MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition for rapid HIV counseling and testing; 2) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using two interventions, PN and FI, for linkage and retention in HIV care; and 3) to assess the cost-effectiveness of PN and FI for linkage and retention in HIV care. This study has the potential to identify effective methods to seek and test substance-using Black MSM, to link the HIV infected to services, and to retain them in care and treatment. The success of such an effort responds to priorities with the national HIV strategy. Results will inform innovative approaches to engaging highest-risk, difficult-to-reach individuals in HIV counseling and testing and retaining them in care and treatment.        The proposed project will test the feasibility of an innovative method to recruit substance-using African-American men who have sex with men into counseling and testing for HIV, and for those who are found to be HIV-infected, into one of two interventions to facilitate retention in HIV care. These two interventions are: peer navigation and financial incentives.

"Pilot Intervention for Discrimination and Mistrust Among HIV Positive Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (MSM) bear the greatest burden of HIV across all races/ethnicities and risk groups, accounting for ~40% of diagnoses among MSM of all races/ethnicities, and one-third among all men. Compared to other races/ethnicities, Blacks living with HIV are less likely to be diagnosed, to be engaged in care, and to receive and adhere to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Black MSM in particular show very low ART adherence. In this 3-year intervention development study, we propose to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant intervention to reduce medical mistrust and address discrimination among Black MSM living with HIV. Our work with Black MSM suggests that culturally relevant factors such as perceived discrimination and HIV- related medical mistrust (e.g., HIV ""conspiracy beliefs,"" like ""HIV is a manmade virus"") contribute to disparities in HIV treatment behaviors, in some cases even more than factors known to be highly influential like depression and substance use. Black MSM living with HIV are at the nexus of 3 stigmatized social categories (HIV-serostatus, race, sexual orientation) from which they face discrimination, which in turn can lead to disparities by increasing detrimental stress responses related to poor self-control (maladaptive coping, poor health behaviors). Discrimination also fosters mistrust of public health entities, and suspicion of medical treatments. However, no interventions have been developed to overcome these culturally relevant barriers. In the proposed innovative community-based participatory research project, we will partner with a Black-MSM- serving AIDS service organization (ASO) with high success in engaging Black MSM in research. In Phase 1, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 Black MSM and 20 social service and mental health providers, and engage stakeholders in a community advisory process to obtain input on sustainable intervention components that can improve the effectiveness of service delivery. In Phase 2, we will conduct a process evaluation of one pilot intervention group of 10 participants, delivered via a community HIV support group. In Phase 3, we will conduct a small randomized pilot trial with 3 intervention groups and 3 control groups (10 participants each). The specific aims are to: 1. Conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with Black MSM, and engage AIDS service organization (ASO) staff and mental health counselors, in order to develop intervention modules that address mistrust and discrimination among Black MSM. 2. Examine whether the pilot intervention can reduce mistrust and improve coping responses to discrimination among Black MSM. 3. Explore pilot intervention effects on mental health, antiretroviral treatment adherence, and engagement in care among Black MSM. Our goal is for the proposed culturally relevant intervention to be exportable to interventions already developed for improving adherence and engagement in care among people living with HIV. If shown to be effective in future R01-funded research, our intervention will be flexible for use in community settings, such as in existing HIV support groups already being sustained throughout the US.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-positive Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and Black MSM living with HIV have very low levels of treatment adherence and poor survival times compared to other groups. We propose to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant intervention for HIV-positive Black MSM to address mistrust and improve coping responses to discrimination - two factors that are related to poor health and health behavior in this population. Developing culturally relevant interventions is key to limiting the impact of discrimination and ultimately, narrowing disparities.                  HIV-positive Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and Black MSM living with HIV have very low levels of treatment adherence and poor survival times compared to other groups.

"Couples-Based HIV/STI Prevention for Drug-Involved, African American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to rigorously test the efficacy of a couples-based HIV and sexually transmitted infection (HIV/STI) preventive intervention for African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in same sex intimate relationships in which at least one partner is using stimulants (herein referred to as ""stimulant-using, African American MSM couples""). The proposed study is a logical progression from the investigative team's prior formative research to take an existing couples based intervention originally for heterosexual couples (""Connect"") and revise/tailor it for methamphetamine-using, African American MSM couples. The adapted intervention was pilot tested using a pre-/post-test design. Findings revealed statistically and clinically significant reductions in sexual and drug risk behaviors. In addition, this formative research informs the proposed study in several additional ways: (1) the importance of addressing stimulants beyond methamphetamine with African American MSM; (2) qualitative data on how a couples-based intervention can interrupt relationship dynamics more unique to drug-involved, African American MSM couples that lead to risk behavior; and (3) couples-based HIV prevention research is feasible, promising, and safe for stimulant using, African American MSM. This earlier research has culminated with a 7-session, manualized intervention entitled ""Connect 'n Unite"" (or CNU-pronounced ""seein' you""-for short) as a candidate couples-based HIV preventive intervention for stimulant-using, African American MSM couples. The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with 270 stimulant-using, African American MSM couples to test the impact of CNU versus a wellness promotion (WP) attention control condition on behavioral and biologically assayed outcomes over a 12-month follow-up period. The study has the following primary aims: (1) to test whether participants assigned to CNU engage in lower HIV/STI behavioral risk-fewer number of unprotected acts of anal intercourse, greater proportion of protected acts of anal intercourse, and fewer number of sexual partners-compared to participants assigned to WP; (2) to test whether participants assigned to CNU have lower cumulative incidence of STIs-chlamydia and gonorrhea-confirmed via biological assay compared to participants assigned to WP; and (3) to test whether participants assigned to CNU engage in less drug use and drug-related HIV risk (i.e., sex under the influence of drugs/alcohol) compared to participants assigned to WP. If successful, this study will advance the field by providing an evidence-based, innovative intervention that can be delivered in drug treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using, African American MSM.         This study addresses the overrepresentation of the African American/Black community among those living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. as well as men who have sex with men (MSM), the transmission category that accounts for the majority of HIV infections. In the absence of a vaccine or cure for HIV infection, behavioral risk reduction represents the best public health tool for prevention of HIV transmission. The proposed randomized clinical trial will rigorously test an innovative, couples-based intervention targeting the intersection of stimulant use and sexual risk behavior among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, with the ultimate goal providing an evidence-based intervention that can be delivered in drug treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using, African American/Black MSM.

"Social Determinants of HIV Risk and Vulnerability among Black MSM in South Africa Background: Until recently, the existence of HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub- Saharan Africa has been overlooked. Much current public health research has highlighted an epidemiological blind spot regarding hidden HIV epidemics among MSM in sub-Saharan Africa, and specifically in South Africa. These studies indicate that HIV risk among MSM is structured by social and economic inequalities as well as a deeply stigmatizing and discriminatory social context regarding same-sex practices, particularly among black MSM. This study will examine the social structuring of HIV risk and vulnerability among black MSM populations in order to contribute to the development of effective HIV prevention interventions among these groups. It will conduct this research in two specific settings: 1) a public health-focused sexual health promotion program (based in Johannesburg, South Africa); and 2) an antiretroviral (ARV) chemoprophylaxis HIV prevention clinical trial (based in Cape Town, South Africa).    Aims: The specific aims of the study are: 1) to describe the key social and cultural determinants that structure HIV risk and vulnerability among black MSM in urban South Africa; 2) to understand how the social and cultural differences among MSM populations in South Africa, particularly with regard to race and gendered sex roles (e.g., masculine/active and feminine/passive), affect perceptions of HIV risk and influence high-risk sexual practices; and 3) to understand and compare how public health-focused health promotion versus antiretroviral chemoprohylaxis approaches to HIV prevention address various structural barriers to HIV prevention among black MSM.    Methods: To examine these issues, qualitative methods will be used to understand the social processes that structure HIV risk and vulnerability and mediate access to HIV prevention interventions. Data will be drawn from participant-observation, discourse analysis, 1- hour semi-structured key informant interviews will be conducted with 40 men from the two sites (20 men from each site; and 20 men from each of two groups: gay- and non-gay-identified MSM), and 1- to 3-hour life history interviews will be conducted with 12 men (6 from each site; and 6 from each of two groups: gay- and non-gay- identified MSM).    Analysis: Data collected from interview transcripts, field notes taken during participant observations, and through discourse analysis of media reports, including posters, conversations, radio chat shows, pamphlets, television stories, and news clippings wil be subjected to a grounded theory approach to data analysis that is commonly used for qualitative and ethnographic data. The training program developed in this application will contribute to the applicant's need to develop expertise in ethnographic and qualitative research methodology and analysis in order to successfully complete his dissertation research and to obtain the necessary academic professionalization to become a highly successful academic researcher in the fields of public health and medical anthropology, and on the topics of HIV/AIDS and global health. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of this study is to examine the social and cultural determinants that mediate HIV vulnerability and risk as well as influence access to HIV prevention interventions among black MSM in urban South Africa. An understanding of these social factors is essential in order to design effective HIV prevention interventions and evaluate their efficacy. The findings of this research will have direct relevance for public health planning and policy initiatives that are currently taking shape in South Africa aimed at addressing the HIV epidemic among black MSM, as well as global public health concerns regarding the social and cultural aspects of implementing ARV chemoprophylaxis as a viable HIV prevention strategy among populations at high-risk for HIV infection.",Social Determinants of HIV Risk and Vulnerability among Black MSM in South Africa,8320308,F31MH088943,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Anthropology ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Group Practice ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' South Africa ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Television ', ' Training Programs ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Feminine ', ' Masculine ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Gays ', ' Glare ', ' news ', ' Shapes ', ' Blind Spots ', ' Retinal blind spot ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' life history ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' multiple drug use ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' risk perception ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Transcript ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' neglect ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' Chemoprophylaxis ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' high risk ', ' public health research ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2012,31104,0.14489808961979897
"Explaining Differences in HIV Prevalence and Incidence in Black and White MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stark differences in HIV prevalence and incidence between black and white MSM are well documented, but dozens of studies have shown that the differences in HIV prevalence are not attributable to higher levels of high risk sex, to higher numbers of sexual partners, or to more drug use among black MSM. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct studies to examine factors beyond individual-level risk behaviors (e.g., dyadic and network factors such as concurrency, and community-level factors such as neighborhood-level indicators of disease burden and poverty) and their relationship to HIV risk for black MSM. We propose a prospective cohort study of 340 HIV-negative black MSM and 340 white MSM, with baseline ascertainment and periodic re-ascertainment of individual-level, dyadic and network-level, and community-level factors to better describe the likely complex array of factors that give rise to disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence in black and white MSM. MSM will be recruited using a well- described method of venue-time-space sampling; we will administer an interview and HIV, STI, and drug testing at baseline, and then repeat both interview and testing at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Primary outcomes will be prevalence of HIV, STI and undiagnosed HIV infection, and incidence of HIV, a combined HIV/STI outcome, and unprotected anal intercourse. Information on network and recent partner characteristics will be collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Analyses will examine individual, dyadic and network, and community level factors associated with prevalent or incident outcomes. Our questionnaire will include theoretically-driven measures based on an ecological systems model, which will allow us to translate findings from our study into the development of future HIV prevention interventions for black and white MSM.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MSM continue to be the most heavily impacted group in the US HIV epidemic, and black MSM are disproportinately impacted by HIV as measured by HIV prevalence and incidence. Although MSM comprise nearly half of new annual HIV case reports in the US, only 10% of currently- available best-evidence HIV prevention interventions have been tested with MSM, and none has been tested with black MSM.

"Developing and Pilot Testing a Mobile Phone-Based HIV/STI Prevention Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is submitted in response to the alarming rates of HIV among young African American men who have sex with men (MSM). The CDC recently reported that between 2006 and 2009, HIV incidence was stable among all populations in the US except young MSM. The overall increase in incidence among young MSM was driven by a 48% increase in HIV infections among young African American MSM. The broad, long-term objective of this research is to identify strategies to reduce the rates of HIV in young African American MSM. This research will take advantage of the men's avid use of mobile phone technology to deliver an innovative intervention to change their sexual risk behavior. The Specific Aims are to: 1) develop an interactive mobile phone-based HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention that is acceptable and feasible to be implemented with African American MSM ages 18 to 24 years; 2) develop an acceptable and feasible text-messaging adjunctive strategy designed to increase its efficacy; 3) pilot test the efficacy of the HIV/STI risk-reductio intervention compared with an attention-control intervention in increasing the proportion of men who report consistent condom use during anal and vaginal intercourse; and 4) pilot test whether the efficacy of the HIV/STI risk-reduction compared with the control intervention is enhanced among men randomized to the tailored text-messaging adjunctive intervention as compared with other men. African American men ages 18 to 24 years who report having anal intercourse with a man in the 2 months prior to screening will be eligible to participate. The intervention and adjunctive strategy will be developed using an iterative process involving focus groups, input from a community advisory board, usability testing, and small-scale pilot testing. Evidence of potential efficacy will be based on a pilot randomized controlled trial involving 180 men with 6-month follow-up. Men will be randomly assigned to the HIV/STI risk-reduction or an attention-control intervention. In addition, they will be randomly assigned to receive or not receive intervention-specific, individually tailored text messages. The approach draws on social cognitive theory and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with the target population. Self-reported consistent condom use, other sexual behaviors, HIV testing, and variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy will be collected via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing. The use of a mobile phone technology for intervention would allay participants' concerns about revealing their sexual involvement with men by virtue of participating in a group or workshop intervention. If current trends in smartphone use continue, this research has the potential to produce a cost-effective intervention that local, state, or national organizations might offer to their young African American MSM clients. The proposed research has great public health significance because although young African American MSM have some of the highest rates of HIV in the US, there is a paucity of efficacious HIV/STI interventions tailored to them.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to account for the largest number of new HIV  cases in the US, and the rates of newly diagnosed HIV in young African American MSM are  especially high, rivaling those in many sub-Saharan African nations.  Yet, no published  randomized controlled trial has tested HIV/STI risk-reduction interventions for young African  American MSM.

"Culturally Relevant HIV Prevention for High-Risk Women ransgender women (assigned 'male' at birth with a female identity) are an understudied group with HIV prevalence rates in the range of 22 to 68%. Public health intervention research has produced no theory- driven, evidence-based interventions for transgender women. The unique cultural context of transgender women creates distinct risk factors that require systematic investigation and then integration into culturally  elevant, community-based approaches to intervention. This K08 application describes a comprehensive,  ntegrated training and research plan designed to serve as a pathway to scientific independence and the expertise to develop and test an innovative and urgently needed intervention to improve health outcomes among a highly marginalized population disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The following  raining objectives are proposed: (1) to acquire expertise in the evaluation and application of theories of behavior change to marginalized populations; (2) to enhance skills in the use of mixed methods data collection and analysis, with an emphasis on techniques relevant to measurement development and theory testing; (3) to gain knowledge and experience with clinical trials methodology, including issues of sampling, randomization, design, protocol development, and ethics; and (4) to obtain training and experience in methods for developing, implementing, and evaluating culturally grounded, theory-driven HIV prevention interventions for transgender women. The specific research aims of the mentored original research are: (1) to describe the role of transgender women's unique cultural context on their HIV-related risk and protective  factors; (2) to create new and to adapt existing quantitative measures to more accuratelyassess  psychosocial dimensions and behavior relevant to transgender women's HIV risk and protective factors; (3)  to identify psychosocial factors associatedwith HIV-related sexual and injection risk behaviors and protective  factors among transgender women; and (4) to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-  driven, culturally grounded HIV prevention intervention for transgender women. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth but identify as female) are an understudied and highly vulnerable group, with HIV prevalence rates in the range of 22 to 68%. Due to stigma and discrimination, they may seek affirmation in ways that increase risk. This project seeks to investigate unique risk factors to develop a culturally relevant HIV prevention intervention for these high-risk women.

"Intervention Development for Social Stress, Mental Health, and HIV Risk Among MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are the population most severely affected by HIV in the U.S. and one of the only risk groups in the U.S. for which new infections continue to rise. MSM also experience a vastly disproportionate risk of mental health disorders, especially depression and anxiety. Numerous studies have shown that this mental health disparity arises from the early and ongoing stressors, known as minority stress, that MSM experience related to their sexual orientation. Despite the fact that minority stress is strongly related to anxiety and depression, and that minority stress and related mental health problems synergistically propel HIV risk behaviors, no existing HIV prevention intervention targets minority stress in order to reduce MSM's HIV risk behavior. This project aims to develop a theoretically-driven intervention that reduces the health-depleting effects of minority stress through targeting the basic psychosocial mechanisms linking minority stress to HIV risk behavior. These mechanisms include maladaptive emotion regulation, negative thinking styles, low self-efficacy, avoidance, and impulsivity, which are the very targets of an existing cognitive-behavioral, manualized intervention--the Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UPTTED). The UPTTED changes these mechanisms using motivational interviewing, interoceptive and situational exposure, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness, and self-monitoring exercises, all grounded in cognitive-behavioral principles and developmental and affective neuroscience models of stress. The proposed study will adapt the UPTTED to support high-risk MSM's adaptive coping with minority stress, alleviate associated depression and anxiety, and reduce HIV risk behavior. The adapted UPTTED is expected to increase awareness of the unhealthy impact of minority stress; facilitate objective self-schemas in the face of minority stress; and strengthen one's skills and self-efficacy for managing minority stress and associated anxiety and depression to reduce risk for acquiring HIV. MSM who have experienced minority stress, mental health problems, and HIV risk behavior in the previous 3 months (n = 30) and community health experts (n = 30) will provide suggestions for adaptations to the existing intervention manual, including culturally relevant vignettes, examples, and exercises for adaptively responding to minority stress and managing HIV risk. The feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention will then be tested in a randomized waitlist controlled trial with MSM (n = 60) who report recent experiences with minority stress, depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behavior. The primary outcome will be HIV risk behavior. Secondary outcomes will be reductions in mediators including depression, anxiety, and the mechanisms of the conceptual model. This project innovatively seeks to test the preliminary efficacy of the first theoretically-driven intervention targeting the mental and sexual health consequences of minority stress and does so by targeting the underlying mechanisms that powerfully drive these simultaneous health threats.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. and one of the only risk groups in the U.S. for which new HIV infection rates are increasing.

"Post exposure prophylaxis among IDU syringe customers-Pharmacy pilot intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this research is to evaluate a structural pilot intervention which aims to expand pharmacy services to include provision of non-occupational HIV post exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and risk reduction information to injection drug users (IDUs) who buy syringes at two pharmacies registered with the New York State Expanded Syringe Access Program (ESAP), a program allowing pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription to help reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs. PEP is the standard of care for health care workers who experience an accidental needle stick. The probability of HIV transmission in IDUs through sharing syringes is either similar to or higher than the risk of an occupational needle stick, which supports the use of nPEP in these cases. There is a preponderance of data supporting PEP (i.e., antiretroviral therapy) as an effective strategy to prevent HIV infection. Thus, PEP is recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in non-occupational cases (exposure via high risk sex or injection behavior) when the exposure source is HIV positive or when the source is unknown but from a HIV prevalent community (e15%). ESAP's success creates a new window of opportunity to offer nPEP as a medically-based HIV prevention approach to low-risk IDUs such as ESAP participants who mostly access sterile syringes but may have an unplanned exposure. By targeting pharmacies in low-income, black and Hispanic communities where HIV burden is highest, a pharmacy-based nPEP program has the potential to create a more comprehensive HIV prevention plan that addresses the long-standing problem of racial disparities in HIV/AIDS. Thus, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate a pharmacy-based nPEP program by comparing IDU syringe customers who would agree to pharmacy-based nPEP vs. those who would decline (in the event of an accidental exposure) with respect to demographics, risk behaviors, perceptions of health care access/needs among IDU syringe customers. Using a pre/post design targeted to syringe customers and their peers we will determine if IDUs/peers who receive nPEP information and risk reduction counseling are more likely to 1) have increased and accurate knowledge of nPEP as an HIV prevention strategy (over time), and 2) more frequently share accurate information about nPEP, risk reduction, and HIV prevention with peers (over time) with respect to baseline demographics, risk behavior, and healthcare needs and access (Aim 2). Among those request nPEP and eligible (i.e., low injection/sex risk IDUs) we will assess side effects and nPEP adherence, risk behavior, social networks, and attitudes and opinions about nPEP via clinical follow up. We will conduct key- informant interviews among key stakeholders (n=15) and enroll IDU syringe customers (and referred peers) from pharmacies providing nPEP information/risk reduction counseling via print materials and video followed by a baseline A-CASI survey (n=638). A peer-driven intervention component will facilitate recruitment and dissemination of nPEP information. Participants will return in 3-months to assess behavior, knowledge, and spread of nPEP information. Analysis will include standard qualitative and quantitative regression techniques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is highly significant and innovative in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV prevention for injection drug users (IDUs), namely pharmacies participating in a nonprescription syringe sales program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access among IDUs in New York City (NYC). This new HIV prevention strategy adds a medical model to the current HIV prevention strategy. This new strategy includes delivery of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in non-occupational situations such as following injection or sexual exposure to HIV which has been recommended by CDC and evaluated among men who have sex with men but never before among IDUs. Our goal is to specifically tackle HIV racial disparities by targeting our pilot intervention to the black and Hispanic communities most heavily burdened with HIV/AIDS. Building on years of IDU and pharmacy-based research, we have selected two public health-minded pharmacies with a sizable and consistent IDU syringe purchasing customer base as the initial PEP delivery venue (as opposed to a visit to a medical setting to obtain a prescription) since IDUs typically experience challenges in accessing care. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only throughout other high-risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other cities and states where similar pharmacy syringe access programs exist. Broader public health impact could also follow, for example, pharmacists can partner with clinicians and other health care providers, including community based organizations to offer these expanded services to groups with limited access to health care services.

"Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This mentored research project will investigate an under-researched aspect of HIV in Africa: the HIV prevention needs of female migrants. Migration and HIV research has almost exclusively focused on HIV risks to male migrants, often failing to measure the risks to women via their involvement in migration. Yet across the region, women's levels of participation in migration have met or exceeded those of men. Moreover, the few studies which have examined HIV risks to female migrants found higher risk behavior and HIV prevalence in migrant compared to non-migrant women. My dissertation study found that migration was associated with a higher risk of HIV infection in women than in men in South Africa. The finding warrants confirmation in East Africa, where HIV/AIDS is devastating communities and the sex disparity in infection risk is striking. HIV prevalence levels in Nyanza Province, Kenya are among the highest in Africa. Previous studies have found high levels of participation in migration by both men and women in Kenya and higher sexual risk behaviors among migrants than non-migrants. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which participation in migration leads to higher risk behavior in women. My proposed plan will address this gap. It is comprised of two phases: a secondary data analysis, and an in-depth qualitative study in Kenya. These two 'modules' will address the following aims: (1) Assess the degree to which HIV infection in women in Kenya is influenced by their participation in migration, and identify explanatory mechanisms by which women's migration may increase their HIV risks. I will use secondary data from Kenya Demographic and Health and AIDS Indicator Surveys and demographic surveillance field sites to carry out analyses to achieve this aim. Using 'HIV Triangulation', I will evaluate these findings along with information from other sources in participatory workshops with local stakeholders in Kenya. This exercise will inform the design of the qualitative study to be carried out in Aim 2: (2) Characterize social and psychological aspects of women's migration experience in Nyanza Province, Kenya which facilitate their risks of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. I will use participant observation and in-depth interviews to characterize the spatial and social features of the common destinations of female migrants, and identify the structural and psychological aspects of women's migration that influence their HIV infection risks. These antecedents to HIV infection in female migrants serve as potential points of HIV prevention intervention, thus laying the groundwork for Aim 3: (3) Develop a preliminary plan for a multi-level HIV prevention intervention with female migrants in Nyanza. In participatory workshops with local stakeholders, I will critically evaluate the cumulative findings of this research, identify potential points of intervention with female migrants, assess acceptability of various options, and develop a preliminary intervention plan. At the start of year 4 I will submit an R34 application to the NIMH for a formative study to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Project Narrative  The research proposed in this application examines the overlooked role that women's  participation in migration may play in sustaining an enormous HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan  Africa. This research will be significant because it will provide the first comprehensive  investigation of the mechanisms through which migration increases HIV risk among women in  the region. A better understanding of women's patterns of migration and mechanisms through  which migration increases HIV risk is necessary both to improve our capacity to control HIV and  to respond to future emerging infectious disease threats.",Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya,8230490,K01MH093205,"['Academic Training ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Survey ', ' Epidemic ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Kenya ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Internal Migrations ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Africa ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' Female Roles ', "" Women's Role "", ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' high risk behavior ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Province ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' population movement ', ' migratory population ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2012,171026,0.006168126547521307

"Developing and Implementing a Cancer Prevention and Control Research Curriculum t DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop and execute a cancer prevention and control curriculum training program at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) that will help prepare professional students in public health and in the biomedical sciences for positions in cancer prevention and control research. The curriculum will be based on a framework for addressing cancer prevention and control from bench to bedside to community and will emphasize research targeted at reduction and elimination of cancer disparities. It will include courses that will provide the students with a suitable knowledge base in the areas of cancer epidemiology and cancer prevention and control and that will teach them how to do research in cancer prevention and control and to develop interventions to reduce disparities; practicum experiences designed to enhance the understanding and application of knowledge and research findings in cancer prevention and control to public health settings by providing an opportunity to gain practical experience, at an appropriate level and content, in the field of cancer prevention and control; and opportunities to conduct research in cancer prevention and control under the guidance of cancer researchers. The faculty of this training program will be drawn from the various graduate teaching programs at MSM, thereby integrating it into MSM training programs. The curriculum will be developed in year one, and it will be offered to students in MSM's Master of Public Health, Master of Science in Clinical Research, Doctor of Medicine and Minority Summer Public Health Fellowship programs. An evaluation plan will be implemented to constantly monitor the program and assess its success in achieving its goals and objectives, and the results will be used for ongoing improvement.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a tremendous need in the US to increase the number of minority scientists, particularly in academic medicine. Although African Americans suffer from major health disparities, less than 1% of investigator-initiated grant dollars go to Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCU) and less than 1% of R01-funded research is awarded to African American researchers. This R25 grant will help to ensure that investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), an HBCU, can play a major role in cancer research by creating a cadre of public health and health care professionals at MSM who have an increased capacity to describe health disparities related to cancer and associated mechanisms over time and across the cancer continuum, and by strengthening the skills and level of competence of MSM graduates in preparation for their inclusion in the public health workforce in the field of cancer prevention and control.

"Peer-driven Intervention to Seek, Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 21% of HIV infections in the U.S. are undiagnosed, but only about 40% of all adults have been tested. Thus, late diagnosis of HIV is common, and, furthermore, treatment delays and disruptions are widespread. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to test for HIV, are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late, and experience serious barriers to entering care compared to other groups. Our research team has studied HHR in New York City (NYC) as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) studies. We found an HIV prevalence rate of 7.4% among HHR in NYC, and only 6% of these infections had been previously diagnosed. Further, in central Brooklyn, 10% were newly diagnosed with HIV. The proposed study will use NHBS methodology to target HHR. Reduced rates of HIV testing and treatment among HHR are due to structural (e.g., poor access), social (e.g., peer norms), and individual-level (e.g., low perceived risk) barriers. Thus active recruitment approaches modeled after NHBS are needed to overcome structural barriers, and peer-delivered interventions effectively reduce individual and social barriers to testing and treatment. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-level enhanced peer-driven intervention (PDI) to seek, test, treat and retain HHR. The enhanced PDI is tailored specifically for HHR and includes computerized, navigation, and peer-delivered components to enhance future sustainability. The design of the intervention is guided by the Theories of Triadic Influence and Normative Regulation. Similar to NHBS, the enhanced PDI will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS). NHBS protocols use both venue-based sampling (VBS) and RDS for reaching populations at high risk. However, VBS and RDS have not yet been directly compared in terms of their yield of undiagnosed HIV infections. Thus the specific aims of this five-year proposed study are to: (1) compare the yield and efficiency of RDS and VBS to identify undiagnosed HIV infection among HHR; (2) measure the efficacy of an enhanced PDI compared to a control in terms of time to HIV care and HAART initiation, viral load suppression, and retention among those newly diagnosed; (3) examine whether the effects of the PDI on HIV health/treatment outcomes are mediated by changes in individual (e.g., perceived risk), social (e.g., peer norms), and structural influences (e.g., enhanced access), and/or whether other factors (e.g., substance use) moderate its effects; and (4) to project the costs and cost-effectiveness of RDS vs. VBS and PDI. We will conduct the enhanced PDI (N=3000) in central Brooklyn, a location hyperendemic for HIV and where HHR experience poor access to testing and treatment. Simultaneously, VBS (N=400) will be undertaken in central Brooklyn. The proposed study complements local and national HIV prevention initiatives and is designed to contribute an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. The vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino; therefore the proposed study may also impact racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.        Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to have been tested for HIV, do not test as frequently, and are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late compared to other risk groups. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to develop an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. Because the vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino, the project has great potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.

"Gender-Specific Combination HIV Prevention for Youth in High-Burden Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is highest of any global region and many infections occur among youth ages 15-24 years. Comprehensive HIV prevention in high-burden sub-Saharan African settings must address both HIV and pregnancy among young females, and HIV prevention strategies among males, using evidence-based approaches in combination. Settings such as Nyanza Province, western Kenya where there is high HIV prevalence, high fertility rates, early onset of sex, frequent intergenerational sex and low circumcision prevalence are a high priority for developing and evaluating multi-component HIV prevention with a focus on young men and women in order to have a large population impact. Our team of biobehavioral and clinical scientists, mathematical modelers, and trial design specialists will: Identify gender (sex)-specific drivers of HIV acquisition risk, including pregnancy among females, for youth in sub-Saharan Africa, and interventions to best address those risks (Aim 1). Conduct mathematical modeling to select optimal combination intervention package components and to assess potential population-level impact (Aim 2). In partnership with a highly-productive nongovernmental organization (NGO) that is delivering PEPFAR-funded HIV prevention services, develop and pilot a combination HIV prevention package specific for female and for male youth - 'MP3-Youth' - in Migori district, Nyanza Province (Aim 3). We will deliver the MP3-Youth package using community-based mobile health teams with the NGO. All youth attending the mobile health events will complete an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey. A randomly-selected subset of n=200 youth will be followed longitudinally at 6- and 12- months using cell phone text message surveys to prospectively assess prevention method uptake, adherence, and risk compensation behaviors. Design a phase IV study protocol for testing the effectiveness of a gender-specific youth HIV prevention package in sub-Saharan Africa (Aim 4). We will disseminate these research protocol recommendations, and study instruments including the mathematical modeling tool, as a combination prevention intervention research toolkit. The MP3-Youth study will provide critical information for design and evaluation of combination HIV prevention intervention packages that are sensitive to gender-specific risks among this most-at-risk population in high-HIV burden African settings.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The study addresses a most-at-risk population (youth in sub-Saharan Africa) and the need for gender-specificity in combination HIV prevention intervention selection, transmission impact modeling, and phase IV effectiveness study designs. This study will leverage a PEPFAR-funded HIV prevention program delivery infrastructure in western Kenya to pilot a combination HIV prevention package for youth leading to an optimal population-impact study protocol.

"Intervention Development for Social Stress, Mental Health, and HIV Risk Among MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are the population most severely affected by HIV in the U.S. and one of the only risk groups in the U.S. for which new infections continue to rise. MSM also experience a vastly disproportionate risk of mental health disorders, especially depression and anxiety. Numerous studies have shown that this mental health disparity arises from the early and ongoing stressors, known as minority stress, that MSM experience related to their sexual orientation. Despite the fact that minority stress is strongly related to anxiety and depression, and that minority stress and related mental health problems synergistically propel HIV risk behaviors, no existing HIV prevention intervention targets minority stress in order to reduce MSM's HIV risk behavior. This project aims to develop a theoretically-driven intervention that reduces the health-depleting effects of minority stress through targeting the basic psychosocial mechanisms linking minority stress to HIV risk behavior. These mechanisms include maladaptive emotion regulation, negative thinking styles, low self-efficacy, avoidance, and impulsivity, which are the very targets of an existing cognitive-behavioral, manualized intervention--the Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UPTTED). The UPTTED changes these mechanisms using motivational interviewing, interoceptive and situational exposure, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness, and self-monitoring exercises, all grounded in cognitive-behavioral principles and developmental and affective neuroscience models of stress. The proposed study will adapt the UPTTED to support high-risk MSM's adaptive coping with minority stress, alleviate associated depression and anxiety, and reduce HIV risk behavior. The adapted UPTTED is expected to increase awareness of the unhealthy impact of minority stress; facilitate objective self-schemas in the face of minority stress; and strengthen one's skills and self-efficacy for managing minority stress and associated anxiety and depression to reduce risk for acquiring HIV. MSM who have experienced minority stress, mental health problems, and HIV risk behavior in the previous 3 months (n = 30) and community health experts (n = 30) will provide suggestions for adaptations to the existing intervention manual, including culturally relevant vignettes, examples, and exercises for adaptively responding to minority stress and managing HIV risk. The feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention will then be tested in a randomized waitlist controlled trial with MSM (n = 60) who report recent experiences with minority stress, depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behavior. The primary outcome will be HIV risk behavior. Secondary outcomes will be reductions in mediators including depression, anxiety, and the mechanisms of the conceptual model. This project innovatively seeks to test the preliminary efficacy of the first theoretically-driven intervention targeting the mental and sexual health consequences of minority stress and does so by targeting the underlying mechanisms that powerfully drive these simultaneous health threats.          Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. and one of the only risk groups in the U.S. for which new HIV infection rates are increasing. By addressing fundamental sources of HIV risk among MSM, including minority stress and associated mental health difficulties, the intervention developed in this project can reduce HIV risk behavior among MSM and therefore the spread of HIV.

"Developing and Implementing a Cancer Prevention and Control Research Curriculum t DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop and execute a cancer prevention and control curriculum training program at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) that will help prepare professional students in public health and in the biomedical sciences for positions in cancer prevention and control research. The curriculum will be based on a framework for addressing cancer prevention and control from bench to bedside to community and will emphasize research targeted at reduction and elimination of cancer disparities. It will include courses that will provide the students with a suitable knowledge base in the areas of cancer epidemiology and cancer prevention and control and that will teach them how to do research in cancer prevention and control and to develop interventions to reduce disparities; practicum experiences designed to enhance the understanding and application of knowledge and research findings in cancer prevention and control to public health settings by providing an opportunity to gain practical experience, at an appropriate level and content, in the field of cancer prevention and control; and opportunities to conduct research in cancer prevention and control under the guidance of cancer researchers. The faculty of this training program will be drawn from the various graduate teaching programs at MSM, thereby integrating it into MSM training programs. The curriculum will be developed in year one, and it will be offered to students in MSM's Master of Public Health, Master of Science in Clinical Research, Doctor of Medicine and Minority Summer Public Health Fellowship programs. An evaluation plan will be implemented to constantly monitor the program and assess its success in achieving its goals and objectives, and the results will be used for ongoing improvement.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a tremendous need in the US to increase the number of minority scientists, particularly in academic medicine. Although African Americans suffer from major health disparities, less than 1% of investigator-initiated grant dollars go to Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCU) and less than 1% of R01-funded research is awarded to African American researchers. This R25 grant will help to ensure that investigators at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), an HBCU, can play a major role in cancer research by creating a cadre of public health and health care professionals at MSM who have an increased capacity to describe health disparities related to cancer and associated mechanisms over time and across the cancer continuum, and by strengthening the skills and level of competence of MSM graduates in preparation for their inclusion in the public health workforce in the field of cancer prevention and control.

"Beliefs and decision-making about HPV vaccination among young men who have sex wi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk of anal cancer as a result of prevalent anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in this population. Prophylactic vaccination is a potentially effective public health strategy for preventing anal cancer. A quadrivalent vaccine is currently approved for the prevention of anal cancer and anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in both males and females. As a result, routine vaccination is recommended for all MSM up through at 26. Maximizing vaccine uptake among populations of MSM will require public health interventions to address factors influencing vaccine acceptability, intentions, and subsequent behavior. Currently, public health educators have limited information available to effectively tailor health education messages and interventions aimed at increasing HPV vaccine uptake among vaccine-eligible adult MSM. The Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) is a viable theoretical framework from which to understand HPV vaccine decision-making and to guide social and culturally tailored interventions. According to this model, health education interventions must address the salient HPV-related beliefs and perceptions expressed by young MSM in order to effectively promote vaccination. The long-term goal of this research is to decrease the incidence of anal cancer among MSM by preventing infection of HPV types -16 and -18 through vaccination. The purpose of the proposed research is to understand the factors important to young MSM when making decisions about HPV vaccination by addressing the following specific aims: (1a) Describe salient outcome, normative, and control beliefs related to HPV vaccination among young MSM; (1b) determine factors that underlie these beliefs through semi-structured qualitative interviews and a structured open-ended qualitative survey; (2) explore the influence of socio-demographic characteristics, such as age and racial/ethnic background, in HPV vaccine decision-making among young MSM; and (3) identify information needs and trusted sources of information regarding HPV vaccination among young MSM. These objectives will be addressed in a multi-method sequential qualitative study including semi-structured interviews (Phase 1) and an open-ended qualitative survey (Phase 2) of MSM 18 to 26 years old. The proposed research will reinforce the applicants training plan in cancer epidemiology, the public health needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations, and the use of qualitative methods in health education research. Through a combination of coursework, directed study, and mentorship from his sponsorship team, the proposed training plan will ensure that the applicant will obtain the level of knowledge and skills necessary to build a program of research that will address the critical public health needs of LGBT populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to a variety of cancers affecting women and men.

"Overcoming Health Disparities to HIV Testing for Deaf MSM through the Internet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-11-119 ""HIV/AIDS Testing and Follow-up among the Underserved in the United States"" (R21), which invites grant applications on populations experiencing ""unique barriers or facilitators to testing and linkage to care"". Deaf Men who have Sex with Men (D-MSM) are one such group, chronically excluded from HIV research, testing, surveillance, education and services. Data from Maryland, the only state to ask information about hearing status when screening for HIV, indicate that the prevalence of HIV in the general deaf and hard-of-hearing population is two to five times higher than for the hearing population. We expect the sub-set of D-MSM to be the highest risk group within the larger Deaf population. In 30 years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, no national studies of HIV testing rates, risk behavior, prevention and treatment needs of D-MSM have been conducted in the US, a chronic problem we begin to address in this application. Internet- based technology can enable us to reach D-MSM for HIV research, services and education. The long term objective of this research is to improve HIV screening, testing, prevention, treatment and access for Deaf people, by developing innovative, culturally- and linguistically-accessible, Internet-based methods and interventions. As a first step, in this R21, we will develop and test online, visually-based qualitative and quantitative research tools (integrating American Sign Language [ASL] and English), while also conducting the first HIV testing and prevention needs assessment of D-MSM in ASL. Integrating the theory of intersectionality and a social cognitive approach, the four aims of this R21 allow us to develop and test the online tools needed to create effective health screening interventions with Deaf populations. Through Aim 1 we will utilize qualitative online interviews in ASL to assess the experiences of a geographically dispersed group of D-MSM in HIV risk behavior, knowledge, barriers and facilitators to testing, and prevention needs. For Aim 2, we will develop the quantitative measures needed to assess the Deaf experience of seeking services, including new Deaf-specific measures. In Aim 3, we will develop and test the resulting online, visually-based survey tools in ASL-English, including an HIV risk screening instrument. Through Aim 4, we will conduct the first online ASL- based HIV needs assessment of D-MSM using a national sample. The public health impact of this study resides in the contribution to advancing research in overcoming health disparities, by developing a suite of online tools and services available nationally to facilitate access to health services for Deaf people, and their providers, thereby addressing the needs of a chronically underserved population.          Deaf MSM (D-MSM) are a high-risk, underserved population experiencing chronic barriers to HIV testing and linkage to care. The principal challenge is that HIV research, testing, counseling and services is typically provided in English, while D-MSM communicate primarily through American Sign Language (ASL) and have, on average, very low (3rd-4th grade) English reading levels. Because the population is geographically dispersed through the USA, most places lack resources to provide confidential HIV testing services in ASL. This R21 is a feasibility and acceptability test of how to use technology to overcome the chronic barriers experienced by D- MSM. We will design, develop and test online methods to engage a diverse national sample of D-MSM in a study of HIV screening and prevention needs, using a combined ASL-English dual format. We plan to develop a suite of online ASL-English tools for providers, researchers, and surveillance to use, thus enabling D-MSM to finally engage in HIV prevention and care.

"Gender-Specific Combination HIV Prevention for Youth in High-Burden Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is highest of any global region and many infections occur among youth ages 15-24 years. Comprehensive HIV prevention in high-burden sub-Saharan African settings must address both HIV and pregnancy among young females, and HIV prevention strategies among males, using evidence-based approaches in combination. Settings such as Nyanza Province, western Kenya where there is high HIV prevalence, high fertility rates, early onset of sex, frequent intergenerational sex and low circumcision prevalence are a high priority for developing and evaluating multi-component HIV prevention with a focus on young men and women in order to have a large population impact. Our team of biobehavioral and clinical scientists, mathematical modelers, and trial design specialists will: Identify gender (sex)-specific drivers of HIV acquisition risk, including pregnancy among females, for youth in sub-Saharan Africa, and interventions to best address those risks (Aim 1). Conduct mathematical modeling to select optimal combination intervention package components and to assess potential population-level impact (Aim 2). In partnership with a highly-productive nongovernmental organization (NGO) that is delivering PEPFAR-funded HIV prevention services, develop and pilot a combination HIV prevention package specific for female and for male youth - 'MP3-Youth' - in Migori district, Nyanza Province (Aim 3). We will deliver the MP3-Youth package using community-based mobile health teams with the NGO. All youth attending the mobile health events will complete an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey. A randomly-selected subset of n=200 youth will be followed longitudinally at 6- and 12- months using cell phone text message surveys to prospectively assess prevention method uptake, adherence, and risk compensation behaviors. Design a phase IV study protocol for testing the effectiveness of a gender-specific youth HIV prevention package in sub-Saharan Africa (Aim 4). We will disseminate these research protocol recommendations, and study instruments including the mathematical modeling tool, as a combination prevention intervention research toolkit. The MP3-Youth study will provide critical information for design and evaluation of combination HIV prevention intervention packages that are sensitive to gender-specific risks among this most-at-risk population in high-HIV burden African settings.

"Syndemics and resilience for HIV transmission in a national sample of vulnerable     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay and bisexual men (GBM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 63% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2010 -they are among the only population in which infections are actually rising. The syndemics model has been applied to MSM finding considerable empirical support for a model in which several specific co-occurring psychosocial health problems (e.g., depression, substance use, trauma from childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence) compound risk for HIV. Yet this model does not account for resilience in the face of syndemic factors-there are GBM who experience syndemics and yet do not engage in hazardous (i.e., HIV risk) behavior. Yet, resilience too is not well understood among GBM. The proposed study builds from the syndemics framework by investigating patterns of resilience in a national US sample of GBM. We have partnered with Harris Interactive, Inc., a research firm that maintains the largest and most comprehensive database of GBM, to identify a national sample of 1,000 GBM to participate in a 3- year longitudinal study (Baseline, 12-, 24-, 36-months) investigating patterns and correlates of syndemic, protective, and resilient factors. We propose to collect behavioral and biological outcomes (at-home HIV and STI testing). We will: (1) Determine patterns and prevalence of syndemic factors and risk behavior in a national sample of GBM; (2) Conduct qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants to identify new/unmeasured mechanisms of resilience and to contextualize our quantitative data (Baseline and 36- months); and (3) Longitudinally track trajectories in resilience, syndemics, and HIV and STI incidence to identify psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with these changing trajectories. Our methodological design-including the use of a national sample, longitudinal assessments, biological testing for HIV and STIs-enhances this study's external validity and thus the impact of our findings. And by tracking patterns in syndemics and resilience, this study will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs. Our application addresses an important problem and barrier to progress in the field (a strengths-based approach to HIV prevention among GBM that goes above and beyond general protective factors to examine resilient factors among men with high risk for hazardous behavior). It has potential to improve scientific knowledge regarding HIV prevention efforts with GBM. And understanding resilience in the face of syndemics can change the conceptual approach, treatments, services, and interventions for a population that remains in critical need.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay and bisexual men are disproportionally impacted by HIV and STIs. Our investigation of factors that are associated with resilience, HIV risk behavior, and HIV/STI incidence over time will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs. By design, our findings will be generalizable such to inform HIV prevention for gay and bisexual men on a national scale.                ",Syndemics and resilience for HIV transmission in a national sample of vulnerable,8605791,R01DA036466,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Molestation, Sexual, Child ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Marriage ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vacuum ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Gays ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' coping ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' Abstinence ', ' service intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' ']",NIDA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2013,633969,0.03274153692465971
"Culturally Relevant HIV Prevention for High-Risk Women ransgender women (assigned 'male' at birth with a female identity) are an understudied group with HIV prevalence rates in the range of 22 to 68%. Public health intervention research has produced no theory- driven, evidence-based interventions for transgender women. The unique cultural context of transgender women creates distinct risk factors that require systematic investigation and then integration into culturally  elevant, community-based approaches to intervention. This K08 application describes a comprehensive,  ntegrated training and research plan designed to serve as a pathway to scientific independence and the expertise to develop and test an innovative and urgently needed intervention to improve health outcomes among a highly marginalized population disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The following  raining objectives are proposed: (1) to acquire expertise in the evaluation and application of theories of behavior change to marginalized populations; (2) to enhance skills in the use of mixed methods data collection and analysis, with an emphasis on techniques relevant to measurement development and theory testing; (3) to gain knowledge and experience with clinical trials methodology, including issues of sampling, randomization, design, protocol development, and ethics; and (4) to obtain training and experience in methods for developing, implementing, and evaluating culturally grounded, theory-driven HIV prevention interventions for transgender women. The specific research aims of the mentored original research are: (1) to describe the role of transgender women's unique cultural context on their HIV-related risk and protective  factors; (2) to create new and to adapt existing quantitative measures to more accuratelyassess  psychosocial dimensions and behavior relevant to transgender women's HIV risk and protective factors; (3)  to identify psychosocial factors associatedwith HIV-related sexual and injection risk behaviors and protective  factors among transgender women; and (4) to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-  driven, culturally grounded HIV prevention intervention for transgender women. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Transgender women (assigned 'male' at birth but identify as female) are an understudied and highly vulnerable group, with HIV prevalence rates in the range of 22 to 68%. Due to stigma and discrimination, they may seek affirmation in ways that increase risk. This project seeks to investigate unique risk factors to develop a culturally relevant HIV prevention intervention for these high-risk women.

"Structural barriers to HIV prevention service utilization among Black MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the District of Columbia (DC), where 3.2% of the population and 7.1% of black males are living with HIV, men having sex with men (MSM) remains the leading mode of transmission, accounting for 62% of all AIDS cases. Throughout the US, black MSM (BMSM) are most severely affected by the epidemic, representing an urgent public health crisis. Research done by Dr. Magnus and colleagues in DC corroborates findings of other studies that individual-level sexual behavior of BMSM is not alone responsible for the alarming rates of HIV/AIDS in this population. Structural barriers to HIV and sexual transmitted infection prevention and treatment, and general healthcare have been posited as correlates of the alarming HIV rates among BMSM and are poorly characterized. Previous data suggest that BMSM often receive culturally insensitive and alienating HIV prevention or care services, experience healthcare disparities, and have other unique structural barriers to care that have not been fully explored. While behavioral risk screening is generally performed for those engaging in high risk sex behavior should they access services, no validated, brief tool exists to rapidly and effectively screen for structural barriers to care. Despite recent advances in HIV prevention, including efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), treatment of the infected partner in a discordant pair (as found in HPTN 052), and current exploration of ""test and treat"" paradigms (HPTN 065), the new tools to prevent HIV are found primarily in clinics; as a result, they will be given to persons regularly and comfortably accessing care. For BMSM who experience structural or societal barriers to care, these men will not reap the benefits of prevention advances. Detailed information regarding these structural barriers to care is required in order to inform new interventions to meet the unique needs of the population of BMSM: it is clear that current biomedical and behavioral interventions will not be able to slow the HIV/AIDS epidemic among BMSM if we cannot overcome these barriers by altering the healthcare system paradigms that prevent people from seeking care. This study will use a mixed-method approach to systematically examine the role of structural barriers to prevention and care services among BMSM. The investigators will base novel instrumentation on the Dynamic Social Systems Model, looking beyond individual-level barriers to care and characterizing societal and structural ones. Upon completion of instrument development with N=45 men, qualitative and quantitative methods will be used on a sample of N=100 peer-referred BMSM to enable evaluation of the instrument's ability to screen for structural barriers to care, and the resultant new rapid assessment structural barrier questionnaire piloted for feasibility on N=30 additional men. Data from this study will be used to inform development of a structural intervention in future studies. Given that the overwhelming majority of new infections are among BMSM, identifying barriers to biomedical and behavioral prevention services is critical to meeting the National HIV/AIDS Strategy benchmarks for reduction in HIV in the US.          Structural barriers to biomedical and behavioral HIV prevention services exist among black men who have sex with men, but are poorly characterized, presenting challenges in slowing the epidemic among those at highest risk. Through development and use of a novel and effective screening instrument among 175 BMSM, this study will inform structural intervention development for BMSM.

"Provider and Peer Support Intervention to Improve ART Adherence among Kenyan Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although men who have sex with men (MSM) are at very high risk for HIV globally, this group has only recently become an important focus of national HIV/AIDS programs in sub-Saharan Africa. While it is clear that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and prevent sexual transmission from HIV-infected MSM, little is known about antiretroviral adherence and barriers to care among African MSM. We have worked with MSM involved in sex work on the Kenyan coast since 2005, and have found significant disparities in HIV treatment engagement, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes in this group, due at least in part to stigma and social isolation. Involving bot providers and peers in an intervention to support MSM as they initiate ART, combined with regular messaging to promote adherence, is an innovative strategy to address this treatment gap. In this R34 application, prepared in response to PAR-11-278 ""Discovery, Development, and Testing of Novel Interventions to Advance HIV Prevention and Care,"" we propose a 3-year developmental project to design and pilot test a culturally appropriate and generalizable antiretroviral adherence intervention for African MSM. The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration among experienced investigators at the University of Washington, Kenya Medical Research Institute, University of Oxford, and Brown University, based on a foundation of 7 years' experience conducting research with Kenyan MSM that underpins the significance and innovation of this proposal. Our specific aims are to: (1) conduct qualitative research including in-depth interviews and focus groups with HIV-1-seropositive MSM, treatment-experienced peers, and their providers to identify common barriers and likely facilitators of ART adherence; (2) design and field test a theoretically driven intervention for MSM combining provider and peer support to encourage engagement in care, build trust, and deliver regular adherence messaging; and (3) implement a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the resulting multi-component intervention versus standard care with 60 MSM participants. We will develop training modules and supporting materials for an intervention including patient-centered care, motivational interviewing, peer support, and adherence messaging adapted to the specific findings of our qualitative study. The proposed research is consistent with and responds to priorities set by the NIH Office of AIDS Research on reducing HIV-related disparities and improving disease outcomes for HIV-infected individuals, and is also consistent with the recommendation set forth in the 2011 Institute of Medicine report on The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People to implement a research agenda designed to advance knowledge and understanding of LGBT health. Findings from this formative R34 study will provide data on the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, safety, and preliminary effect sizes or an R01 proposal to test this intervention and its components in a fully powered RCT including a larger, more diverse sample of MSM from multiple sites in sub-Saharan Africa.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up has greatly reduced morbidity and mortality due to HIV/AIDS, and has the potential to prevent HIV transmission by reducing plasma viral load. Men who have sex with men are at high risk for HIV in Africa, and face significant stigma and discrimination leading to health care disparities. This project aims to identify barriers and facilitators to ART adherence among Kenyan MSM, and design a targeted intervention using support from providers and peers to promote MSM's engagement in care and adherence. By involving MSM, Kenyan LGBT organizations, HIV care providers, and Ministry of Health representatives, we will ensure that the resulting intervention is feasible, acceptable, tolerable, safe, and ready to be tested for efficacy.                ",Provider and Peer Support Intervention to Improve ART Adherence among Kenyan Men,8467531,R34MH099946,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Cues ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' gay (sexual orientation) ', ' Homosexuals ', ' Infection ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Kenya ', ' Laws ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"STAR-Seek, Test and Retain. Linkages for Black HIV+, Substance Using MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic in the United States most severely affects men who have sex with men (MSM): 57% of all new infections occur in this population. Black MSM bear a disproportionate burden, with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV testing less frequently than other MSM; are less likely to be aware that they are HIV infected; are more likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care; and are less likely to be prescribed ART when eligible. These disparities are pronounced in substance using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis and delayed engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM behavior and high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this population, even as the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches 50%. Reducing HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS Strategy priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the US. Setting: The study will seek and recruit substance-using Black MSM in New York City for HIV testing and will link and retain those who are HIV-infected in HIV primary care. Study Aims: In response to the urgent public health need to seek substance-using Black MSM, identify those with HIV infection, and link the latter to HIV services, the study aims are as follows: Seek and Test: Respondent driven sampling (RDS) will be used to recruit substance-using Black MSM for HIV testing. RDS has been used in HIV surveillance among hard-to-reach populations and, to a limited extent, as a strategy for engaging hard-to-reach populations in services. We will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS to seek, recruit, and offer HIV testing to this high-risk population. Link and Retain: Participants with reactive rapid HIV test results and who are not currently in care will be randomized to two linkage and retention strategies: patient navigation (PN) and financial incentives (FI). One hundred participants will be randomized into each arm of the study. The primary objectives are: 1) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS for seeking and recruiting substance-using Black MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition for rapid HIV counseling and testing; 2) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using two interventions, PN and FI, for linkage and retention in HIV care; and 3) to assess the cost-effectiveness of PN and FI for linkage and retention in HIV care. This study has the potential to identify effective methods to seek and test substance-using Black MSM, to link the HIV infected to services, and to retain them in care and treatment. The success of such an effort responds to priorities with the national HIV strategy. Results will inform innovative approaches to engaging highest-risk, difficult-to-reach individuals in HIV counseling and testing and retaining them in care and treatment.        The proposed project will test the feasibility of an innovative method to recruit substance-using African-American men who have sex with men into counseling and testing for HIV, and for those who are found to be HIV-infected, into one of two interventions to facilitate retention in HIV care. These two interventions are: peer navigation and financial incentives. This project has the potential to increase timely diagnosis of HIV and retention in HIV primary care among populations disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US, and most burdened by multiple barriers to appropriate care.

"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, after the emergence of antiretroviral therapy but before the potential of treatment as prevention had been established. Since its inception, CIRA has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings,contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, focused on the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment and the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive and multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized implementation science and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs that will diversify and replenish the field of HIV research. Building on recent advances in HIV science, the Center will foster and support various research programs in strategic areas with emphasis on implementation/translation research and combination, multi-level approaches. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will create a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers focused on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence and New Haven, This unique initiative will complement ongoing efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the 12 largest metropolitan areas by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to smaller cities with high HIV prevalence. Our global research will also focus on advancing implementation science and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, particularly South Africa, Russia and China. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five Cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods, In keeping with our strategic foci, each Core will have a role in supporting implementation science and building capacity to conduct research in small urban centers with high HIV prevalence. Addressing law, policy and ethics issues related to the conduct of HIV research will also be integral to the work of CIRA and its Cores in the new project period. Core level and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation.        RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Advances in HIV science hold great promise yet there are formidable barriers to translating this knowledge into practice. HIV disparities, a,resurgence of HIV in young MSM, the rise of HIV co-morbid conditions, the  aging ofthe HIV population, and need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public  health.

"Understanding Delayed Access to HIV Prevention Services among Black MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV AIDS remains a major health crisis among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). In a recent large-scale HIV seroprevalence survey, prevalence rates were highest among AA MSM (28%), compared to 16% among MSM of all other ethnicities. This is a health disparity that has been replicated in many different studies since the start of the AIDS epidemic. Given the scale of the HIV epidemic among AA MSM, we cannot prevent the ongoing spread of HIV in the United States until we find ways to field effective HIV prevention programs for AA MSM. Combination prevention approaches to HIV/AIDS offer considerable promise to achieve this goal by addressing some of the high risk contexts that increase transmission risk among AA MSM. However, our ability to design effective combination prevention approaches to lower HIV transmission risk among AA MSM depends on achieving a clear epidemiological understanding of both barriers and facilitators to HIV testing, receiving reactive test results for men who are HIV positive and timel access to medical care if HIV positive. Unfortunately, our ability to explain HIV testing and health care access behaviors among AA MSM is currently limited due to the difficulties of recruiting sufficiently large samples of AA MSM who are delaying access to HIV prevention and care services. These shortcomings hamper our ability to draw effective conclusions about targeted prevention efforts for AA MSM, including most fundamentally an informed evidence base upon which combination prevention strategies must be built. Syndemics theory, which examines the effects and interactions among multiple psychosocial health conditions (i.e. substance abuse, depression, violence victimization) associated with increased risks within marginalized and vulnerable populations provides an important theoretical framework to examining these behaviors, especially since it encompasses both vulnerabilities and resiliencies in high risk populations. This application proposes to address this situation by collecting data from a large scale sample of AA MSM (N=6000) to: 1. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of uptake of HIV testing among AA MSM 2. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of unknown HIV seropositivity among AA MSM 3. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of timely access to care among HIV+ AA MSM By partnering with well-established community groups to recruit large samples of vulnerable men, we will be in a position to characterize the barriers and facilitators to the essential buildig blocks of combination prevention approaches and so provide crucial information for developing effective programs to lower HIV transmission among AA MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV AIDS is a major health crisis among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM).

"Adapting the SiSTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW Prevention Trilogy for Black Men      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adapting the SISTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW HIV Prevention Trilogy  for Black Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have been disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic. Yet, there are very few scientifically demonstrated effective HIV prevention interventions targeting Black MSM. This SBIR Phase II project will address this gap and fill an important product niche for community-based organizations, health departments and clinics serving Black MSM by creating (1) a modular program package and online program builder to support the delivery of the popular SISTA/SIHLE/WILLOW HIV prevention suite with Black MSM; (2) an interactive, computer-delivered version of the adapted program; and (3) an online forum to provide updated resources and enable practitioners to share program implementation concerns and experiences. We will also conduct a 3-arm, quasi-experimental outcome study in three states to assess the effectiveness of these programs in reducing HIV risk behaviors among Black MSM. The project offers many innovations, including  the creation of the first evidence-based computer-delivered HIV prevention program specifically designed for Black MSM;  the development of a modular program package and online program builder to tailor program content for different sub-populations of Black MSM; the presentation of risk reduction activities within an explicit sexual health/harm reduction framework, an approach called for by practitioners and public health officials in recent years (Goldhanner & Mayer, 2011; Grossman et al., 2011; Wolitski & Fenton, 2011);  a discussion of the pros and cons of pre- exposure prophylaxis (PREP) as an HIV prevention strategy;  the inclusion of ""seroadaptive"" risk reduction practices (Wei et al., 2011) in the outcome study to assess the wide range of harm reduction practices currently practiced by Black MSM; and an online practitioner forum. In sum, the project's combination of a modular adaptation package, online program builder, computer-delivered intervention and practitioner forum provides a model to support the cost-effective implementation of evidence-based programs on a wide range of public health issues in diver implementation contexts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States, and Black MSM aged 18-29 have the highest new HIV infection rate of any group of MSM or African-Americans. This project will help reduce new HIV infections among Black MSM by (1) developing a version of the popular SISTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW HIV prevention trilogy specifically tailored for implementation with Black MSM; (2) creating a 2.5 hour long, computer-delivered version of the adapted program; and (3) conducting a quasi-experimental 3-arm trial to test the effectiveness of these programs. The project's combination of a modular adaptation package, online program builder, and computer-delivered intervention provides a model to support the cost-effective implementation of evidence-based programs to address a wide range of public health issues. The outcome study data will also further our understanding of how harm reduction strategies and computer technologies can be utilized to reduce disease risk and promote healthy behaviors more generally.            ",Adapting the SiSTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW Prevention Trilogy for Black Men ,8466178,R44MD005812,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Grant ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Language ', ' Love ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Play ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Sum ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Evidence based program ', ' usability ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,SOCIOMETRICS CORPORATION,R44,2013,638122,0.15415268518426384
"CBPR for Sexual Health & Reduction of HIV Health Disparities Among MSM in PR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the overall rate of new HIV infections In the U.S. has remained relatively steady since 2006, rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) have significantly increased, particularly in ethnic/racial minority MSM. Similar patterns are seen among MSM in Puerto Rico where high levels of social stigma and bias contribute to poor use of HIV screening and late engagement in HIV care, resulting in high rates of premature mortality and high levels of circulating virus-thereby fueling secondary infections and thus sustaining the epidemic. In response to the longstanding absence of evidence-based HIV interventions for MSM in PR, and using a CBPR approach, we will adapt existing Sexual Health Promotion intervention technology for use among MSM who are HIV-/status unknown/or who are HIV+ but not enrolled in HIV care monitoring/treatment. In Year 1, we will conduct an ethnographically-oriented Community Assessment Process to develop a detailed understanding of sources of alienation and delay in care among MSM and to elicit direct feedback from MSM about their services needs and priorities. A parallel elicitation will be undertaken among service providers. This elicitation process will support identification of key stakeholders from both groups who will serve on the Community Advisory Board which will guide adaptation and implementation of the intervention. In Years 2 and 3, and building on an existing ""Core"" study within a local community STI/HIV services clinic (CLETS), we will recruit 240 MSM to participate in a preliminary assessment of the impact of the intervention. Using a ""Comparative Effectiveness"" approach, we will compare conventional, 2-session pre and post-test counseling with the adapted 2-session Sexual Health Promotion intervention on key outcomes, including sexual risk reduction, frequency of UAI, understanding the role of untreated STIs in facilitating HIV transmission, awareness of the role of early initiation of ARV care in effective management of HIV disease, health-seeking skills (including improved stigma management skills), routinization of non-symptom-driven HIV screening at 6 month intervals, and rapid uptake in HIV monitoring/ARV treatment services among newly-diagnosed HIV+ MSM. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed study will use a CBPR strategy to adapt and test sexual health promotion interventions to increase MSM participation in STI/HIV testing, with the goal of accelerating detection and early enrollment in treatment.",CBPR for Sexual Health & Reduction of HIV Health Disparities Among MSM in PR,8500777,R24MD008090,"['Accounting ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Latin America ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' Process Assessment ', ' Process Assessment (Health Care) ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Fostering ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Clinic ', ' secondary infection ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' treatment center ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,R24,2013,363432,0.1239804503236314

"Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This mentored research project will investigate an under-researched aspect of HIV in Africa: the HIV prevention needs of female migrants. Migration and HIV research has almost exclusively focused on HIV risks to male migrants, often failing to measure the risks to women via their involvement in migration. Yet across the region, women's levels of participation in migration have met or exceeded those of men. Moreover, the few studies which have examined HIV risks to female migrants found higher risk behavior and HIV prevalence in migrant compared to non-migrant women. My dissertation study found that migration was associated with a higher risk of HIV infection in women than in men in South Africa. The finding warrants confirmation in East Africa, where HIV/AIDS is devastating communities and the sex disparity in infection risk is striking. HIV prevalence levels in Nyanza Province, Kenya are among the highest in Africa. Previous studies have found high levels of participation in migration by both men and women in Kenya and higher sexual risk behaviors among migrants than non-migrants. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which participation in migration leads to higher risk behavior in women. My proposed plan will address this gap. It is comprised of two phases: a secondary data analysis, and an in-depth qualitative study in Kenya. These two 'modules' will address the following aims: (1) Assess the degree to which HIV infection in women in Kenya is influenced by their participation in migration, and identify explanatory mechanisms by which women's migration may increase their HIV risks. I will use secondary data from Kenya Demographic and Health and AIDS Indicator Surveys and demographic surveillance field sites to carry out analyses to achieve this aim. Using 'HIV Triangulation', I will evaluate these findings along with information from other sources in participatory workshops with local stakeholders in Kenya. This exercise will inform the design of the qualitative study to be carried out in Aim 2: (2) Characterize social and psychological aspects of women's migration experience in Nyanza Province, Kenya which facilitate their risks of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. I will use participant observation and in-depth interviews to characterize the spatial and social features of the common destinations of female migrants, and identify the structural and psychological aspects of women's migration that influence their HIV infection risks. These antecedents to HIV infection in female migrants serve as potential points of HIV prevention intervention, thus laying the groundwork for Aim 3: (3) Develop a preliminary plan for a multi-level HIV prevention intervention with female migrants in Nyanza. In participatory workshops with local stakeholders, I will critically evaluate the cumulative findings of this research, identify potential points of intervention with female migrants, assess acceptability of various options, and develop a preliminary intervention plan. At the start of year 4 I will submit an R34 application to the NIMH for a formative study to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Project Narrative  The research proposed in this application examines the overlooked role that women's  participation in migration may play in sustaining an enormous HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan  Africa. This research will be significant because it will provide the first comprehensive  investigation of the mechanisms through which migration increases HIV risk among women in  the region. A better understanding of women's patterns of migration and mechanisms through  which migration increases HIV risk is necessary both to improve our capacity to control HIV and  to respond to future emerging infectious disease threats.",Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya,8400900,K01MH093205,"['Academic Training ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Survey ', ' Epidemic ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Kenya ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Internal Migrations ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Africa ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' Female Roles ', "" Women's Role "", ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' high risk behavior ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Province ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' population movement ', ' migratory population ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2013,171419,0.006168126547521307
"Post exposure prophylaxis among IDU syringe customers-Pharmacy pilot intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this research is to evaluate a structural pilot intervention which aims to expand pharmacy services to include provision of non-occupational HIV post exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and risk reduction information to injection drug users (IDUs) who buy syringes at two pharmacies registered with the New York State Expanded Syringe Access Program (ESAP), a program allowing pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription to help reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs. PEP is the standard of care for health care workers who experience an accidental needle stick. The probability of HIV transmission in IDUs through sharing syringes is either similar to or higher than the risk of an occupational needle stick, which supports the use of nPEP in these cases. There is a preponderance of data supporting PEP (i.e., antiretroviral therapy) as an effective strategy to prevent HIV infection. Thus, PEP is recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in non-occupational cases (exposure via high risk sex or injection behavior) when the exposure source is HIV positive or when the source is unknown but from a HIV prevalent community (e15%). ESAP's success creates a new window of opportunity to offer nPEP as a medically-based HIV prevention approach to low-risk IDUs such as ESAP participants who mostly access sterile syringes but may have an unplanned exposure. By targeting pharmacies in low-income, black and Hispanic communities where HIV burden is highest, a pharmacy-based nPEP program has the potential to create a more comprehensive HIV prevention plan that addresses the long-standing problem of racial disparities in HIV/AIDS. Thus, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate a pharmacy-based nPEP program by comparing IDU syringe customers who would agree to pharmacy-based nPEP vs. those who would decline (in the event of an accidental exposure) with respect to demographics, risk behaviors, perceptions of health care access/needs among IDU syringe customers. Using a pre/post design targeted to syringe customers and their peers we will determine if IDUs/peers who receive nPEP information and risk reduction counseling are more likely to 1) have increased and accurate knowledge of nPEP as an HIV prevention strategy (over time), and 2) more frequently share accurate information about nPEP, risk reduction, and HIV prevention with peers (over time) with respect to baseline demographics, risk behavior, and healthcare needs and access (Aim 2). Among those request nPEP and eligible (i.e., low injection/sex risk IDUs) we will assess side effects and nPEP adherence, risk behavior, social networks, and attitudes and opinions about nPEP via clinical follow up. We will conduct key- informant interviews among key stakeholders (n=15) and enroll IDU syringe customers (and referred peers) from pharmacies providing nPEP information/risk reduction counseling via print materials and video followed by a baseline A-CASI survey (n=638). A peer-driven intervention component will facilitate recruitment and dissemination of nPEP information. Participants will return in 3-months to assess behavior, knowledge, and spread of nPEP information. Analysis will include standard qualitative and quantitative regression techniques.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is highly significant and innovative in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV prevention for injection drug users (IDUs), namely pharmacies participating in a nonprescription syringe sales program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access among IDUs in New York City (NYC). This new HIV prevention strategy adds a medical model to the current HIV prevention strategy. This new strategy includes delivery of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in non-occupational situations such as following injection or sexual exposure to HIV which has been recommended by CDC and evaluated among men who have sex with men but never before among IDUs. Our goal is to specifically tackle HIV racial disparities by targeting our pilot intervention to the black and Hispanic communities most heavily burdened with HIV/AIDS. Building on years of IDU and pharmacy-based research, we have selected two public health-minded pharmacies with a sizable and consistent IDU syringe purchasing customer base as the initial PEP delivery venue (as opposed to a visit to a medical setting to obtain a prescription) since IDUs typically experience challenges in accessing care. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only throughout other high-risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other cities and states where similar pharmacy syringe access programs exist. Broader public health impact could also follow, for example, pharmacists can partner with clinicians and other health care providers, including community based organizations to offer these expanded services to groups with limited access to health care services.

"Gammacell 1000 Elite Self-Contained Blood Irradiator     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are requesting funds to purchase a gamma irradiator system (Gammacell 1000 Elite, Best Theratronics) to support NIH-funded basic health disparities-related research at Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM)/Atlanta University Center (AUC). The Gammacell 1000 Elite is a self-contained gamma irradiator using a cesium source. The irradiator is used for a variety of research purposes including, but not limited to: studying radiation-induced injury, sterilizing materials, selecting specific cell types, and suppressing immune reactions. It is, therefore, an indispensable instrument for biomedical research, in particular in the areas of hematology, cancer, infectious/immune diseases, transplantation, and regenerative medicine. Clark Atlanta University (CAU) currently houses one Gammacell irradiator under supervision of the MSM/AUC Radiation Safety Office. This is the only gamma cell Irradiator in the AUC Consortium, which consists of four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (MSM, CAU, Morehouse College, and Spelman College). For the past 18 years, since the irradiator was purchased by CAU in 1994, multiple investigators, including those supported by NIH grants at MSM and CAU have been benefiting from using the irradiator for their research in cancer, sexually transmittable infectious diseases, and regenerative medicine for stroke and cardiovascular disease with the purpose of eliminating health disparities. As of December 31, 2010, the manufacturer issued an end-of-useful-life- cycle letter and can no longer guarantee replacement parts on this unit. Consequently, if a mechanical malfunction occurs and replacement parts are not in inventory, the irradiator will become permanently disabled and subject to mandatory decommissioning. Continued availability of the instrument is indispensable to four major users representing four departments at MSM, who are conducting NIH- funded health disparities research. Thus, we are requesting funds to purchase a new Gammacell irradiator on MSM campus. MSM/AUC administration has agreed to commit space and financial support for a facility to house the irradiator as well as preventative maintenance service contracts. The MSM/AUC Radiation Safety Program will train/assist users and will monitor usage of the facility. The availability of the instrument is essential for recruiting and training talented students and scientists who will become tomorrow's leaders in helping to solve the persistent health disparities that exist in underserved minority populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gammacell 1000 Elite is a self-contained gamma irradiator with a cesium source, which is indispensable for biomedical research such as hematology, cancer, infectious/immune diseases, transplantation, and regenerative medicine.

"Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and HIV In the United States, African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS. These disparities have not been adequately explained by individual level factors. Much of the HIV behavioral research to date has focused on measuring specific risk events without consideration of the social, geographic (ie. spatial) and temporal context of these events. Temporal and spatial dimensions are pertinent to the study of same sex behavior, particularly among AA MSM, who experience high levels of stigmatization and discrimination. Social networks have been found to be powerful influences on individuals' behaviors, through processes of social comparison, social monitoring and norm formation. However, what is less understood are the ways in which social networks are also shaped by time and geography. There has been little study of these dimensions as they relate to HIV risk and prevention, especially among AA MSM. The K01 Career Development award will allow me to undertake an interdisciplinary program of study and research concerning the temporal and spatial dimensions of social networks and how these influence HIV risk behavior, specifically among AA MSM. This training will result in my acquisition of knowledge and skills in geography and qualitative methodology to complement my existing research, with the goal of better informing the development of culturally appropriate interventions. Specifically, I will gain: 1) knowledge about concepts and methodologies from the subdisciplines time-geography, cultural geography and health geography as they apply to the study of social networks and HIV, 2) training in time-geography methodology to collect data about HIV risk behavior as it occurs within the  context of social networks, place and time, 3) training in observational ethnographic methods, 4) skills in qualitative data analysis and, 5) intensive mentoring and guidance to integrate the training and research with my current research such that I can seek funding as an independent scientist and advance the field of HIV prevention science. One of the primary outcomes of this training will include development of a conceptual model that social scientists can use to design future interventions and studies which incorporates the spatial and temporal dimensions of social networks and HIV risk behavior. This model will serve as a basis for  developing a larger R01 level study of AA MSM and HIV risk and development and evaluation of an accompanying HIV prevention behavioral intervention. Furthermore, the research and training from the award will result in scientific publications that will advance the field of HIV prevention and behavioral science. This research is an interdisciplinary approach to understand the socio-spatial and temporal context of HIV risk behavior among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). Results from this study will identify new conceptual pathways about HIV risk that can inform the development of sustainable culturally-relevant behavioral interventions and policies which bolster preventive behavior within various social contexts and reduce racial disparities in HIV among MSM.","Social Geographies of Black Men who have sex with men: place, networks and

"Prevention of HIV Infection in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Risk for HIV infection in the United States falls along sharp lines of disparity related to sexual orientation and race/ethnicity. HIV infection has always taken a heavy toll on men who have sex with men (MSM) and also on African Americans. However, HIV incidence disparity is most striking of all for MSM who are also African American, a segment that probably accounts for less than one percent of the American population but fully 25% of all new HIV infections in the United States. Surprisingly, very few HIV prevention interventions designed for African American MSM have been undertaken, and most existing approaches have relied on individual or small-group risk reduction counseling. These existing models have limited cultural and practical suitability for reaching high-risk African American MSM who are hidden in the community and unlikely to seek out sexual risk reduction counseling. Interventions directed to individuals alone also do not attend sufficiently to the important influence played by social norms and social network factors on risk behavior. In contrast to individual counseling models, HIV prevention interventions that are directed to social networks of Black MSM in the community and that work through natural influence channels within these networks hold the potential for reaching deeply into hidden and vulnerable populations of African American MSM. Network-level HIV prevention interventions rely on oral communication traditions and cultural models appropriate in minority communities, and can strengthen social network normative support for risk reduction. Following a 1-year formative research phase that will provide data needed to contextualize the study's recruitment, assessment, and intervention content and delivery methods, we will undertake a social network-level intervention outcome trial in 3 cities: Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Miami. Project-wide, 24 sociocentric networks of African American MSM-each expected to be composed of approximately 40 people (total n=960 participants)-will be recruited. 12 of the networks (n=480 participants) will be randomized to a comparison condition and receive HIV/STD testing, treatment, and individual counseling. The other 12 networks (n=480) will receive the same counseling and testing and also a social network intervention that identifies, trains, and engages empirically-identified influence leaders of each network to deliver ongoing, theory-based, and culturally tailored HIV prevention advice, recommendations, and support to other network members. The study will determine the comparative effectiveness of the social network intervention to the counseling, testing, and treatment comparison condition on measures of sexual risk, substance use associated with sexual risk behavior, and STD/HIV incidence assessed with laboratory measures at 6- and 18-month followup points. The study aim is to develop and determine the efficacy of an intervention modality capable of reaching and preventing HIV among high-risk African American MSM in the community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 56,000 Americans continue to contract HIV each year, and African American MSM account for a far disproportionate number of incident infections. Public health efforts to reduce HIV incidence in the United States require the development of new prevention approaches delivered using modalities that can target and reach those population segments at greatest vulnerability. If successful, this research will identify an HIV prevention intervention approach, practical for public health service providers, that lends itself well to rapid uptake and use by CBOs, health departments, and minority organizations concerned about AIDS.

"Peer-driven Intervention to Seek, Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 21% of HIV infections in the U.S. are undiagnosed, but only about 40% of all adults have been tested. Thus, late diagnosis of HIV is common, and, furthermore, treatment delays and disruptions are widespread. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to test for HIV, are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late, and experience serious barriers to entering care compared to other groups. Our research team has studied HHR in New York City (NYC) as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) studies. We found an HIV prevalence rate of 7.4% among HHR in NYC, and only 6% of these infections had been previously diagnosed. Further, in central Brooklyn, 10% were newly diagnosed with HIV. The proposed study will use NHBS methodology to target HHR. Reduced rates of HIV testing and treatment among HHR are due to structural (e.g., poor access), social (e.g., peer norms), and individual-level (e.g., low perceived risk) barriers. Thus active recruitment approaches modeled after NHBS are needed to overcome structural barriers, and peer-delivered interventions effectively reduce individual and social barriers to testing and treatment. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-level enhanced peer-driven intervention (PDI) to seek, test, treat and retain HHR. The enhanced PDI is tailored specifically for HHR and includes computerized, navigation, and peer-delivered components to enhance future sustainability. The design of the intervention is guided by the Theories of Triadic Influence and Normative Regulation. Similar to NHBS, the enhanced PDI will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS). NHBS protocols use both venue-based sampling (VBS) and RDS for reaching populations at high risk. However, VBS and RDS have not yet been directly compared in terms of their yield of undiagnosed HIV infections. Thus the specific aims of this five-year proposed study are to: (1) compare the yield and efficiency of RDS and VBS to identify undiagnosed HIV infection among HHR; (2) measure the efficacy of an enhanced PDI compared to a control in terms of time to HIV care and HAART initiation, viral load suppression, and retention among those newly diagnosed; (3) examine whether the effects of the PDI on HIV health/treatment outcomes are mediated by changes in individual (e.g., perceived risk), social (e.g., peer norms), and structural influences (e.g., enhanced access), and/or whether other factors (e.g., substance use) moderate its effects; and (4) to project the costs and cost-effectiveness of RDS vs. VBS and PDI. We will conduct the enhanced PDI (N=3000) in central Brooklyn, a location hyperendemic for HIV and where HHR experience poor access to testing and treatment. Simultaneously, VBS (N=400) will be undertaken in central Brooklyn. The proposed study complements local and national HIV prevention initiatives and is designed to contribute an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. The vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino; therefore the proposed study may also impact racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.        Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to have been tested for HIV, do not test as frequently, and are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late compared to other risk groups. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to develop an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. Because the vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino, the project has great potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.

"Pilot Intervention for Discrimination and Mistrust Among HIV Positive Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (MSM) bear the greatest burden of HIV across all races/ethnicities and risk groups, accounting for ~40% of diagnoses among MSM of all races/ethnicities, and one-third among all men. Compared to other races/ethnicities, Blacks living with HIV are less likely to be diagnosed, to be engaged in care, and to receive and adhere to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Black MSM in particular show very low ART adherence. In this 3-year intervention development study, we propose to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant intervention to reduce medical mistrust and address discrimination among Black MSM living with HIV. Our work with Black MSM suggests that culturally relevant factors such as perceived discrimination and HIV- related medical mistrust (e.g., HIV ""conspiracy beliefs,"" like ""HIV is a manmade virus"") contribute to disparities in HIV treatment behaviors, in some cases even more than factors known to be highly influential like depression and substance use. Black MSM living with HIV are at the nexus of 3 stigmatized social categories (HIV-serostatus, race, sexual orientation) from which they face discrimination, which in turn can lead to disparities by increasing detrimental stress responses related to poor self-control (maladaptive coping, poor health behaviors). Discrimination also fosters mistrust of public health entities, and suspicion of medical treatments. However, no interventions have been developed to overcome these culturally relevant barriers. In the proposed innovative community-based participatory research project, we will partner with a Black-MSM- serving AIDS service organization (ASO) with high success in engaging Black MSM in research. In Phase 1, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 Black MSM and 20 social service and mental health providers, and engage stakeholders in a community advisory process to obtain input on sustainable intervention components that can improve the effectiveness of service delivery. In Phase 2, we will conduct a process evaluation of one pilot intervention group of 10 participants, delivered via a community HIV support group. In Phase 3, we will conduct a small randomized pilot trial with 3 intervention groups and 3 control groups (10 participants each). The specific aims are to: 1. Conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with Black MSM, and engage AIDS service organization (ASO) staff and mental health counselors, in order to develop intervention modules that address mistrust and discrimination among Black MSM. 2. Examine whether the pilot intervention can reduce mistrust and improve coping responses to discrimination among Black MSM. 3. Explore pilot intervention effects on mental health, antiretroviral treatment adherence, and engagement in care among Black MSM. Our goal is for the proposed culturally relevant intervention to be exportable to interventions already developed for improving adherence and engagement in care among people living with HIV. If shown to be effective in future R01-funded research, our intervention will be flexible for use in community settings, such as in existing HIV support groups already being sustained throughout the US.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-positive Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and Black MSM living with HIV have very low levels of treatment adherence and poor survival times compared to other groups. We propose to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant intervention for HIV-positive Black MSM to address mistrust and improve coping responses to discrimination - two factors that are related to poor health and health behavior in this population. Developing culturally relevant interventions is key to limiting the impact of discrimination and ultimately, narrowing disparities.                ",Pilot Intervention for Discrimination and Mistrust Among HIV Positive Black Men,8514079,R34MH096544,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Emotions ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Motion ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Life ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' self control ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' social ', ' acute stress ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R34,2013,238271,0.12628256003390662
"RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV, interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present, only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. Our team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect, reductions in stimulant use, improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count, and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed randomized controlled trial addresses a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM). By utilizing contingency management as the platform for the delivery of an innovative positive affect intervention, this research could identify the first efficacious integrative intervention for promoting long-term reductions in HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM. Efficacious interventions for this population are desperately needed to alleviate human suffering associated with substance abuse as well as optimize health outcomes and decrease HIV transmission rates.            ",RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users,8467276,R01DA033854,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Couples ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' San Francisco ', ' sex abstinence ', ' not sexually active ', ' celibate ', ' abstaining from sex ', ' abstain from sexual intercouse ', ' abstain from sexual activity ', ' abstain from intercouse ', ' Celibacy ', ' Sexual Abstinence ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Measures ', ' free base cocaine ', ' Crack Cocaine ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' improved ', ' Phlebotomy ', ' Venous blood sampling ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' contingency management ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Regulation ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Population Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' resistance strain ', ' resistant strain ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2013,560081,0.08931327555861968
"Addressing Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Current and Future Epidemics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related deaths now exceed HIV-related deaths in the US. Throughout the world, HCV is hyperendemic in people who inject drugs (PWID). New outbreaks of acute HCV infection are unfolding in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) and in 15-24 year olds who have transitioned from abuse of prescription opioids to illicit opiate injection. In patients with chronic HCV infection, 20-25% wil develop liver disease which may manifest as cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognosis for HCC is extremely poor, and HCV is the chief etiologic agent for this type of cancer. Recent discoveries in HCV prevention and treatment provide a great opportunity to reverse the trend toward increasing rates of HCV, HCV/HIV co-infection, and HCC. This study will use the methods of Implementation Science - research synthesis, mathematical modeling and simulation, and comparative effectiveness analyses - to determine how best to constitute a portfolio of interventions for the prevention and control of HCV and its consequences while taking into limited resources and underlying epidemiologic and social network features account. A dissemination plan will make extensive use of technology, including social media, and guidance from key stakeholders. These are our specific aims: 1. Synthesize evidence characterizing a) transition from misuse of prescription opioids to drug injection, b) HCV epidemiology and prevention for PWID and HIV+ MSM, and c) progression and treatment of HCV disease in these two groups, to derive best estimates to populate our HCV natural history and transmission models. 2. Use agent-based modeling to estimate the effects of scale-up of individual and combined prevention- and treatment-related interventions on HCV transmission and natural history in PWID and HIV+MSM. 3. Determine the combination of interventions for particular budget and epidemiologic scenarios that a) minimizes acute and chronic HCV infections, including HIV/HCV co-infection, b) prevents the greatest number of cases of HCV-related HCC and other serious sequelae, c) maximizes life expectancy and quality- adjusted life expectancy and d) reduces health disparities. 4. In collaboration with our Dissemination Advisory Board, apply an integrated knowledge-exchange approach to providing our target audiences (policymakers, public health and harm reduction practice communities, PWID and HIV+MSM) with the knowledge and tools to implement evidence-based HCV control strategies or reduce personal risk of infection and its consequences. The broad objective of this study is to provide an evidence base to guide allocation of scarce public resources in the US and other countries where HCV is principally transmitted among PWID. This will be accomplished by synthesizing, modeling and translating very recent developments in HCV epidemiology, prevention and treatment into practical tools to optimize population health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Statement The goal of this study is to help decision makers improve population health by providing guidance on the most effective set of interventions to control hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in people who inject drugs and HIV- positive men who have sex with men. In the US, HCV is the main causal factor in hepatocellular carcinoma which has a very poor prognosis, and HCV-related deaths now exceed deaths related to HIV. This research will synthesize evidence as to the effectiveness of different intervention strategies in terms of both individual benefit (preventing HCV infections in these populations, reducing HCC and other consequences of HCV), and in terms of societal benefit (reducing health care costs and impact on life expectancy).            ",Addressing Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma:

"Health,Hope and Healing:A National conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW Abstract  The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities and is on par with those found in several African countries. HIV directly or indirectly related to men having sex with men is the single largest contributor to HIV infection among Blacks, accounting for nearly half of all cases among Black men. Despite large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV prevalence and risk, just one tested intervention specifically for Black men who have sex with men (MSM) has been published. Furthermore, Black men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) have been particularly underserved and underrepresented in HIV research. Attention must be lent to address the behavioral, psychological, socio-cultural, and biomedical factors, as well as the racial/ethnic disparities that exist and contribute to HIV infection and transmission among Black MSM and MSMW. This 5-year R13 conference grant proposal entitled, Health, Hope and Healing (H3): A National Conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW, will assemble the best minds currently studying HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW. The H3 conference series, with an annual meeting over five years, aims to advance HIV biobehavioral research, mentor junior investigators, and foster community based participatory collaborations. The three measurable conference outcomes are to: 1) Produce an executive report detailing the long term research, training and policy agenda, highlighting recommendations designed to reduce HIV in Black MSM and MSMW; 2) Produce an executive report detailing successful mentorship of junior investigators; and 3) Develop successful community based participatory research collaboratives, as measured by the submission of at least one joint proposal that operationalizes the research. The H3 Conference series will be among the first to discuss the needs of Black MSM and MSMW within a holistic and socio-cultural paradigm and disseminate research findings and healthcare and policy recommendations for eliminating HIV/AIDS within this population. Project Narrative  The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities. Researchers, clinicians, community members and congressman have all advocated for more attention to this epidemic. The proposed Health, Hope and Healing conference will gather the best minds currently studying HIV among Black MSM and MSMW. This conference aims to advance research, mentor junior investigators, foster community based participatory collaborations and disseminate findings and recommendations for the purpose of eliminating HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW.","Health,Hope and Healing:A National conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW",8436289,R13MH089835,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Archives ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Videotape ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Healed ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Monograph ', ' programs ', ' fighting ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Manuscripts ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Measurable ', ' Research Training ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' healing ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' MSMW ', ' men who have sex with men and women ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R13,2013,1,0.04421181200055216
"Sexual Networks, Drugs, and HIV Risk among Men Who Have Sex With Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K01 award will provide Dr. Hong Van Tieu with the necessary training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in HIV epidemiology and prevention. Her short-term goals are to expand her experience in HIV epidemiology and prevention research among men who have sex with men (MSM), gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics, social network analysis, and qualitative research, and further the understanding of the influence of sexual networks on HIV and sexual risk behaviors among Black and White MSM. She will receive specialized training in the epidemiology of substance use and its relationship to HIV risk among MSM. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team has expertise in HIV and substance use epidemiology, prevention, and clinical research and strong track records of supporting junior faculty to become independently funded investigators. The New York Blood Center has a long history of conducting HIV epidemiology and behavioral and biomedical prevention research among MSM and is profoundly committed to the success of this K01 award. The dramatically disproportionate HIV infection rates among Black MSM in the U.S remain unexplained by differences in individual behavioral risk. One hypothesis is that the characteristics of sexual networks of Black MSM place them at increased risk of HIV compared to non-Black MSM. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM and to examine the relationship of their network characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors using an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The proposed research will enroll a large sample of Black and White MSM (n=878) in New York City as a substudy of an NIH R01-funded study to evaluate the hypothesis that certain structural (e.g., network size, density, partner concurrency) and compositional (e.g., assortative and disassortative mixing, durability of relationships) characteristics of Black MSM sexual networks increase the men's risk of HIV infection. The specific aims of this study are the following: (1) to describe and compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, (2) to compare the association of structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks with HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, and determine whether differences in sexual network characteristics explain the disparity in HIV prevalence between Black and White MSM, and (3) to explore in depth the contexts and meanings of sexual partnerships and networks by evaluating how Black and White MSM subjectively experience their sexual networks and perceive them to influence their sexual risk behaviors using qualitative research methods. A focus of the research is on drug and alcohol use within sexual networks and their relationship to HIV risk among MSM. This research will provide critically important information on the sexual networks of Black MSM to explain the alarming rates of HIV infection among this population and to inform development and testing of sexual network-based intervention strategies to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission risk. It will also serve as an excellent platform for the candidate to gain essential training in HIV epidemiology and prevention research and generate innovative ideas for her first R01 grant application.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the structure and make-up of sexual networks (connections between sexual partners) among Black and White men who have sex with men in New York City and assess the relationship of these characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors. This study will have direct impact on the design of programs to reduce HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men.

"A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Bruthas Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW) are at particular risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and represent a priority population for developing effective interventions. Despite the urgent need for effective prevention approaches for AAMSMW, to our knowledge no evidence-based HIV interventions have been developed and tested for this population. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of the Bruthas Project, an individual-level HIV prevention intervention, which builds on standardized HIV counseling and testing. Delivered in a series of four sessions by trained African American male counselors, the BP focuses on reviewing HIV transmission routes for male and female partners, strengthening sexual communication skills with both male and female partners, and improving condom use skills and other safer sex negotiation strategies. A randomized controlled trial of BP is necessary to determine the efficacy of the intervention and can lead to improved public health efforts at reducing HIV risk behavior among AAMSMW and in the African American community more generally. To evaluate the effect of the BP, we will recruit and enroll a cohort of 400 AAMSMW who will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition, in which they will be offered BP, or to the comparison condition, in which they will receive standardized HIV testing and counseling with referral to case management. We will follow the cohort over 9 months and will assess participants at three time points: baseline, 3 months follow-up, and 6 months follow- up.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to respond to the HIV epidemic in the African American community is a national public health priority. Men account for more than half of HIV infections among African Americans. We have worked diligently over the past four years to develop a HIV prevention intervention for African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW), the Bruthas Project. No controlled intervention studies to date have proven to be effective in significantly lowering HIV-related risk behavior for AAMSMW. Given the urgency of the epidemic among African Americans in general, and African American MSM in particular, a large scale randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to test the efficacy of this promising HIV prevention intervention for these men, and if it is found to be effective, to move it quickly into practice.

Given the urgency of the epidemic among African Americans in general, and African American MSM in particular, a large scale randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to test the efficacy of this promising HIV prevention intervention for these men, and if it is found to be effective, to move it quickly into practice.",A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Bruthas Project,8518469,R01MH090899,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Motivation ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Case Management ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' evaluation/testing ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Community Networks ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Life ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Secrecy ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' safer sex ', ' staff intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' public health priorities ', ' MSMW ', ' men who have sex with men and women ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2013,465107,0.01147353869979007
"Explaining Differences in HIV Prevalence and Incidence in Black and White MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stark differences in HIV prevalence and incidence between black and white MSM are well documented, but dozens of studies have shown that the differences in HIV prevalence are not attributable to higher levels of high risk sex, to higher numbers of sexual partners, or to more drug use among black MSM. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct studies to examine factors beyond individual-level risk behaviors (e.g., dyadic and network factors such as concurrency, and community-level factors such as neighborhood-level indicators of disease burden and poverty) and their relationship to HIV risk for black MSM. We propose a prospective cohort study of 340 HIV-negative black MSM and 340 white MSM, with baseline ascertainment and periodic re-ascertainment of individual-level, dyadic and network-level, and community-level factors to better describe the likely complex array of factors that give rise to disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence in black and white MSM. MSM will be recruited using a well- described method of venue-time-space sampling; we will administer an interview and HIV, STI, and drug testing at baseline, and then repeat both interview and testing at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Primary outcomes will be prevalence of HIV, STI and undiagnosed HIV infection, and incidence of HIV, a combined HIV/STI outcome, and unprotected anal intercourse. Information on network and recent partner characteristics will be collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Analyses will examine individual, dyadic and network, and community level factors associated with prevalent or incident outcomes. Our questionnaire will include theoretically-driven measures based on an ecological systems model, which will allow us to translate findings from our study into the development of future HIV prevention interventions for black and white MSM.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MSM continue to be the most heavily impacted group in the US HIV epidemic, and black MSM are disproportinately impacted by HIV as measured by HIV prevalence and incidence. Although MSM comprise nearly half of new annual HIV case reports in the US, only 10% of currently- available best-evidence HIV prevention interventions have been tested with MSM, and none has been tested with black MSM.

"Developing and Pilot Testing a Mobile Phone-Based HIV/STI Prevention Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is submitted in response to the alarming rates of HIV among young African American men who have sex with men (MSM). The CDC recently reported that between 2006 and 2009, HIV incidence was stable among all populations in the US except young MSM. The overall increase in incidence among young MSM was driven by a 48% increase in HIV infections among young African American MSM. The broad, long-term objective of this research is to identify strategies to reduce the rates of HIV in young African American MSM. This research will take advantage of the men's avid use of mobile phone technology to deliver an innovative intervention to change their sexual risk behavior. The Specific Aims are to: 1) develop an interactive mobile phone-based HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention that is acceptable and feasible to be implemented with African American MSM ages 18 to 24 years; 2) develop an acceptable and feasible text-messaging adjunctive strategy designed to increase its efficacy; 3) pilot test the efficacy of the HIV/STI risk-reductio intervention compared with an attention-control intervention in increasing the proportion of men who report consistent condom use during anal and vaginal intercourse; and 4) pilot test whether the efficacy of the HIV/STI risk-reduction compared with the control intervention is enhanced among men randomized to the tailored text-messaging adjunctive intervention as compared with other men. African American men ages 18 to 24 years who report having anal intercourse with a man in the 2 months prior to screening will be eligible to participate. The intervention and adjunctive strategy will be developed using an iterative process involving focus groups, input from a community advisory board, usability testing, and small-scale pilot testing. Evidence of potential efficacy will be based on a pilot randomized controlled trial involving 180 men with 6-month follow-up. Men will be randomly assigned to the HIV/STI risk-reduction or an attention-control intervention. In addition, they will be randomly assigned to receive or not receive intervention-specific, individually tailored text messages. The approach draws on social cognitive theory and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with the target population. Self-reported consistent condom use, other sexual behaviors, HIV testing, and variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy will be collected via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing. The use of a mobile phone technology for intervention would allay participants' concerns about revealing their sexual involvement with men by virtue of participating in a group or workshop intervention. If current trends in smartphone use continue, this research has the potential to produce a cost-effective intervention that local, state, or national organizations might offer to their young African American MSM clients. The proposed research has great public health significance because although young African American MSM have some of the highest rates of HIV in the US, there is a paucity of efficacious HIV/STI interventions tailored to them.          Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to account for the largest number of new HIV  cases in the US, and the rates of newly diagnosed HIV in young African American MSM are  especially high, rivaling those in many sub-Saharan African nations.  Yet, no published  randomized controlled trial has tested HIV/STI risk-reduction interventions for young African  American MSM. These men are avid users of mobile phones, and if current trends in smartphone ownership continue, the potential product of this research, if successful, might be a cost-effective intervention that local, state, or national organizations can offer to thir young African American MSM clients.

"RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV, interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present, only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. Our team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect, reductions in stimulant use, improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count, and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities.          The proposed randomized controlled trial addresses a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM). By utilizing contingency management as the platform for the delivery of an innovative positive affect intervention, this research could identify the first efficacious integrative intervention for promoting long-term reductions in HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM. Efficacious interventions for this population are desperately needed to alleviate human suffering associated with substance abuse as well as optimize health outcomes and decrease HIV transmission rates.

"Using Sexual Network Transmission Models to Explain HIV Disparities Between Black     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, disparities in HIV between black and white men who have sex with men (MSM) are large and unexplained. Individual behavioral reasons for these disparities have been generally dismissed as possible explanations. Network explanations have proven useful in understanding persistent disparities in STI burdens in other populations, and have been hypothesized to explain racial/ethnic disparities in US MSM. However, these hypotheses have not been tested using modeling approaches for two reasons. First, there have historically been inadequate data to parameterize models with respect to critical network characteristics, such as concurrency, transitivity, and assortative mixing by key characteristics. Second, model structures have not been developed that account for the unique aspects of MSM sexual networks. We propose to develop this understanding by analyzing new data on MSM sexual networks from multiple studies conducted by the investigators in Atlanta, a metropolitan area with large populations of both black and white MSM and significant racial disparities in HIV. We will recall participants in current and recent studies to collect additional data as necessary. Using these new network parameters, we will extend an existing stochastic simulation model of HIV transmission in MSM to reflect these network attributes. This approach will use STERGMs (separable temporal exponential random graph models), which can handle dynamic network data in the form of cross-sectional network structure combined with information on relational duration or dissolution patterns. We will use the expanded, newly parameterized model for two purposes. First, we will use the model to attempt to describe the role of network parameters in black/white disparities in HIV incidence among US MSM. Second, we will use the model to test which modifiable network parameters might have the most potential in reducing HIV incidence, if modified among MSM populations. Completion of these activities is expected to result in the testing of hypotheses about reasons for black/white disparities in HIV among US MSM, modeling tools that will be useful to further evaluation of MSM networks, and specific, proposed targets for new prevention interventions for this most highly impacted community in the US HIV epidemic. Our Specific Aims are: (1) to develop a comprehensive set of individual, dyadic, and triadic network parameters, accounting for transmission potential, for use in an agent-based HIV transmission model for black and white MSM in metropolitan Atlanta; (2) to expand an existing stochastic, agent-based HIV transmission model for MSM to include code for modeling network features for black and white MSM; (3) to utilize this enhanced model and parameters to (a) determine whether racial disparities for HIV observed among Atlanta-area MSM can be explained using existing hypotheses for their sources in combination with our measured network phenomena; (b) identify the highest- impact network properties for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in HIV among US MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most heavily impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic; within this community, large racial differences in HIV prevalence exist, which are not explained by obvious differences in sexual behavior. In this study, we will use existing and newly collected network data, in combination with mathematical modeling, to consider whether multiple aspects of the structure of sexual networks can help explain this disparity. This work offers the potential to answer the persistent question of why some MSM communities have high HIV levels, and to identify future strategies for reducing those levels.                    ",Using Sexual Network Transmission Models to Explain HIV Disparities Between Black,8601779,R21HD075662,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Simulate ', ' tool ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' metropolitan ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2013,237853,0.14591233910538698
"Syndemics and resilience for HIV transmission in a national sample of vulnerable     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay and bisexual men (GBM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 63% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2010 -they are among the only population in which infections are actually rising. The syndemics model has been applied to MSM finding considerable empirical support for a model in which several specific co-occurring psychosocial health problems (e.g., depression, substance use, trauma from childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence) compound risk for HIV. Yet this model does not account for resilience in the face of syndemic factors-there are GBM who experience syndemics and yet do not engage in hazardous (i.e., HIV risk) behavior. Yet, resilience too is not well understood among GBM. The proposed study builds from the syndemics framework by investigating patterns of resilience in a national US sample of GBM. We have partnered with Harris Interactive, Inc., a research firm that maintains the largest and most comprehensive database of GBM, to identify a national sample of 1,000 GBM to participate in a 3- year longitudinal study (Baseline, 12-, 24-, 36-months) investigating patterns and correlates of syndemic, protective, and resilient factors. We propose to collect behavioral and biological outcomes (at-home HIV and STI testing). We will: (1) Determine patterns and prevalence of syndemic factors and risk behavior in a national sample of GBM; (2) Conduct qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants to identify new/unmeasured mechanisms of resilience and to contextualize our quantitative data (Baseline and 36- months); and (3) Longitudinally track trajectories in resilience, syndemics, and HIV and STI incidence to identify psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with these changing trajectories. Our methodological design-including the use of a national sample, longitudinal assessments, biological testing for HIV and STIs-enhances this study's external validity and thus the impact of our findings. And by tracking patterns in syndemics and resilience, this study will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs. Our application addresses an important problem and barrier to progress in the field (a strengths-based approach to HIV prevention among GBM that goes above and beyond general protective factors to examine resilient factors among men with high risk for hazardous behavior). It has potential to improve scientific knowledge regarding HIV prevention efforts with GBM.

"Understanding Delayed Access to HIV Prevention Services among Black MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV AIDS remains a major health crisis among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). In a recent large-scale HIV seroprevalence survey, prevalence rates were highest among AA MSM (28%), compared to 16% among MSM of all other ethnicities. This is a health disparity that has been replicated in many different studies since the start of the AIDS epidemic. Given the scale of the HIV epidemic among AA MSM, we cannot prevent the ongoing spread of HIV in the United States until we find ways to field effective HIV prevention programs for AA MSM. Combination prevention approaches to HIV/AIDS offer considerable promise to achieve this goal by addressing some of the high risk contexts that increase transmission risk among AA MSM. However, our ability to design effective combination prevention approaches to lower HIV transmission risk among AA MSM depends on achieving a clear epidemiological understanding of both barriers and facilitators to HIV testing, receiving reactive test results for men who are HIV positive and timel access to medical care if HIV positive. Unfortunately, our ability to explain HIV testing and health care access behaviors among AA MSM is currently limited due to the difficulties of recruiting sufficiently large samples of AA MSM who are delaying access to HIV prevention and care services. These shortcomings hamper our ability to draw effective conclusions about targeted prevention efforts for AA MSM, including most fundamentally an informed evidence base upon which combination prevention strategies must be built. Syndemics theory, which examines the effects and interactions among multiple psychosocial health conditions (i.e. substance abuse, depression, violence victimization) associated with increased risks within marginalized and vulnerable populations provides an important theoretical framework to examining these behaviors, especially since it encompasses both vulnerabilities and resiliencies in high risk populations. This application proposes to address this situation by collecting data from a large scale sample of AA MSM (N=6000) to: 1. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of uptake of HIV testing among AA MSM 2. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of unknown HIV seropositivity among AA MSM 3. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of timely access to care among HIV+ AA MSM By partnering with well-established community groups to recruit large samples of vulnerable men, we will be in a position to characterize the barriers and facilitators to the essential buildig blocks of combination prevention approaches and so provide crucial information for developing effective programs to lower HIV transmission among AA MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV AIDS is a major health crisis among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM).

"Gender-Specific Combination HIV Prevention for Youth in High-Burden Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is highest of any global region and many infections occur among youth ages 15-24 years. Comprehensive HIV prevention in high-burden sub-Saharan African settings must address both HIV and pregnancy among young females, and HIV prevention strategies among males, using evidence-based approaches in combination. Settings such as Nyanza Province, western Kenya where there is high HIV prevalence, high fertility rates, early onset of sex, frequent intergenerational sex and low circumcision prevalence are a high priority for developing and evaluating multi-component HIV prevention with a focus on young men and women in order to have a large population impact. Our team of biobehavioral and clinical scientists, mathematical modelers, and trial design specialists will: Identify gender (sex)-specific drivers of HIV acquisition risk, including pregnancy among females, for youth in sub-Saharan Africa, and interventions to best address those risks (Aim 1). Conduct mathematical modeling to select optimal combination intervention package components and to assess potential population-level impact (Aim 2). In partnership with a highly-productive nongovernmental organization (NGO) that is delivering PEPFAR-funded HIV prevention services, develop and pilot a combination HIV prevention package specific for female and for male youth - 'MP3-Youth' - in Migori district, Nyanza Province (Aim 3). We will deliver the MP3-Youth package using community-based mobile health teams with the NGO. All youth attending the mobile health events will complete an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey. A randomly-selected subset of n=200 youth will be followed longitudinally at 6- and 12- months using cell phone text message surveys to prospectively assess prevention method uptake, adherence, and risk compensation behaviors. Design a phase IV study protocol for testing the effectiveness of a gender-specific youth HIV prevention package in sub-Saharan Africa (Aim 4). We will disseminate these research protocol recommendations, and study instruments including the mathematical modeling tool, as a combination prevention intervention research toolkit. The MP3-Youth study will provide critical information for design and evaluation of combination HIV prevention intervention packages that are sensitive to gender-specific risks among this most-at-risk population in high-HIV burden African settings.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The study addresses a most-at-risk population (youth in sub-Saharan Africa) and the need for gender-specificity in combination HIV prevention intervention selection, transmission impact modeling, and phase IV effectiveness study designs. This study will leverage a PEPFAR-funded HIV prevention program delivery infrastructure in western Kenya to pilot a combination HIV prevention package for youth leading to an optimal population-impact study protocol. A translational science package will be created and disseminated that others can use to conduct epidemiologic reviews, mathematical modeling, and study design for combination HIV prevention research in their settings.

"Addressing Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Current and Future Epidemics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related deaths now exceed HIV-related deaths in the US. Throughout the world, HCV is hyperendemic in people who inject drugs (PWID). New outbreaks of acute HCV infection are unfolding in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) and in 15-24 year olds who have transitioned from abuse of prescription opioids to illicit opiate injection. In patients with chronic HCV infection, 20-25% wil develop liver disease which may manifest as cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognosis for HCC is extremely poor, and HCV is the chief etiologic agent for this type of cancer. Recent discoveries in HCV prevention and treatment provide a great opportunity to reverse the trend toward increasing rates of HCV, HCV/HIV co-infection, and HCC. This study will use the methods of Implementation Science - research synthesis, mathematical modeling and simulation, and comparative effectiveness analyses - to determine how best to constitute a portfolio of interventions for the prevention and control of HCV and its consequences while taking into limited resources and underlying epidemiologic and social network features account. A dissemination plan will make extensive use of technology, including social media, and guidance from key stakeholders. These are our specific aims: 1. Synthesize evidence characterizing a) transition from misuse of prescription opioids to drug injection, b) HCV epidemiology and prevention for PWID and HIV+ MSM, and c) progression and treatment of HCV disease in these two groups, to derive best estimates to populate our HCV natural history and transmission models. 2. Use agent-based modeling to estimate the effects of scale-up of individual and combined prevention- and treatment-related interventions on HCV transmission and natural history in PWID and HIV+MSM. 3. Determine the combination of interventions for particular budget and epidemiologic scenarios that a) minimizes acute and chronic HCV infections, including HIV/HCV co-infection, b) prevents the greatest number of cases of HCV-related HCC and other serious sequelae, c) maximizes life expectancy and quality- adjusted life expectancy and d) reduces health disparities. 4. In collaboration with our Dissemination Advisory Board, apply an integrated knowledge-exchange approach to providing our target audiences (policymakers, public health and harm reduction practice communities, PWID and HIV+MSM) with the knowledge and tools to implement evidence-based HCV control strategies or reduce personal risk of infection and its consequences. The broad objective of this study is to provide an evidence base to guide allocation of scarce public resources in the US and other countries where HCV is principally transmitted among PWID. This will be accomplished by synthesizing, modeling and translating very recent developments in HCV epidemiology, prevention and treatment into practical tools to optimize population health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Statement The goal of this study is to help decision makers improve population health by providing guidance on the most effective set of interventions to control hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in people who inject drugs and HIV- positive men who have sex with men. In the US, HCV is the main causal factor in hepatocellular carcinoma which has a very poor prognosis, and HCV-related deaths now exceed deaths related to HIV. This research will synthesize evidence as to the effectiveness of different intervention strategies in terms of both individual benefit (preventing HCV infections in these populations, reducing HCC and other consequences of HCV), and in terms of societal benefit (reducing health care costs and impact on life expectancy).            ",Addressing Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma:

"Using Phylogenetics to Elucidate HIV Transmission Patterns and Inform Prevention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a K08 award for Ann Dennis MD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, who is training to become an independent investigator in HIV transmission, epidemiology, and prevention. Despite marked advances in HIV treatment and prevention, new HIV diagnoses continue in the southeastern US where significant disparities still exist among racial minorities and men who have sex with men. Innovative methods are needed to successfully decrease incident HIV infections among these vulnerable groups. The identification of phylogenetic HIV transmission networks or ""clusters"", which are highly related sequences from individuals with shared HIV transmission, offers unique insight into the structure of HIV transmission on a population level that cannot be obtained through contact tracing or other patient-reported history. Paired with clinical and demographic data, these transmission clusters may provide new targets to direct HIV prevention efforts for groups at highest risk for ongoing transmission. The overall research objective is to characterize local phylogenetic clusters in North Carolina and investigate the use of phylogeny in the public health setting to target future interventions. The proposed study will employ innovative methods in molecular epidemiology to reconstruct transmission clusters using large repositories of HIV pol sequences extracted from antiretroviral resistance testing sent during routine clinical care. The aims of the study are to: ) Identify the temporal and clinical features of emerging or expanding HIV transmission clusters in a large clinical cohort of new and established HIV cases; 2) Assess the effect of higher density sampling of prevalent HIV cases on the detection of transmission clusters and characterize the statewide epidemic structure; and 3) Determine feasibility of incorporating HIV sequence analysis into routine HIV surveillance in a circumscribed geographic area. Dr. Dennis's mentoring team will consist of primary mentor Joseph Eron, MD, Professor of Medicine at UNC with over 20 years of experience in HIV clinical and epidemiologic research. Two co-mentors will offer complementary areas of expertise in HIV epidemiology and phylogenetics: William Miller, MD, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine at UNC whose research focuses on HIV epidemiology; and Stephane Hue, PhD, virologist at University College London, an internationally recognized expert in HIV phylogenetics and UNC collaborator since 2010. Dr. Dennis' training plan links to the proposed research aims: establish a solid foundation in HIV epidemiology including surveillance and outbreak investigation; expand skills in phylogenetic analyses integrating time- scaled and geographic data; and explore ethical issues surrounding phylogenetics in HIV prevention. Training will be accomplished through a combination of didactic courses, workshops, and practicums. These training and research activities will allow Dr. Dennis to mature into an independent investigator and provide a basis for an R01 to implement real-time phylogeny to direct prevention interventions and track trends in HIV incidence.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV transmission continues in the U.S. despite comprehensive prevention measures; new strategies to find and interrupt chains of ongoing transmission are needed. Combining clinical, demographic, and behavioral data with analysis of highly related HIV nucleotide sequences will allow population-level transmission patterns to be uncovered and support the development of public health tools to better direct enhanced interventions, reducing HIV transmission.              ",Using Phylogenetics to Elucidate HIV Transmission Patterns and Inform

"CBPR for Sexual Health & Reduction of HIV Health Disparities Among MSM in PR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the overall rate of new HIV infections In the U.S. has remained relatively steady since 2006, rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) have significantly increased, particularly in ethnic/racial minority MSM. Similar patterns are seen among MSM in Puerto Rico where high levels of social stigma and bias contribute to poor use of HIV screening and late engagement in HIV care, resulting in high rates of premature mortality and high levels of circulating virus-thereby fueling secondary infections and thus sustaining the epidemic. In response to the longstanding absence of evidence-based HIV interventions for MSM in PR, and using a CBPR approach, we will adapt existing Sexual Health Promotion intervention technology for use among MSM who are HIV-/status unknown/or who are HIV+ but not enrolled in HIV care monitoring/treatment. In Year 1, we will conduct an ethnographically-oriented Community Assessment Process to develop a detailed understanding of sources of alienation and delay in care among MSM and to elicit direct feedback from MSM about their services needs and priorities. A parallel elicitation will be undertaken among service providers. This elicitation process will support identification of key stakeholders from both groups who will serve on the Community Advisory Board which will guide adaptation and implementation of the intervention. In Years 2 and 3, and building on an existing ""Core"" study within a local community STI/HIV services clinic (CLETS), we will recruit 240 MSM to participate in a preliminary assessment of the impact of the intervention. Using a ""Comparative Effectiveness"" approach, we will compare conventional, 2-session pre and post-test counseling with the adapted 2-session Sexual Health Promotion intervention on key outcomes, including sexual risk reduction, frequency of UAI, understanding the role of untreated STIs in facilitating HIV transmission, awareness of the role of early initiation of ARV care in effective management of HIV disease, health-seeking skills (including improved stigma management skills), routinization of non-symptom-driven HIV screening at 6 month intervals, and rapid uptake in HIV monitoring/ARV treatment services among newly-diagnosed HIV+ MSM. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed study will use a CBPR strategy to adapt and test sexual health promotion interventions to increase MSM participation in STI/HIV testing, with the goal of accelerating detection and early enrollment in treatment.",CBPR for Sexual Health & Reduction of HIV Health Disparities Among MSM in PR,8720815,R24MD008090,"['Accounting ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Latin America ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' Process Assessment ', ' Process Assessment (Health Care) ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Fostering ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Clinic ', ' secondary infection ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' treatment center ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,R24,2014,370681,0.1239804503236314
"HIV Risk, Drug Use, Social Networks: Homeless Persons Transitioned to Housing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We utilize a social ecological model to understand longitudinal changes in HIV risk and prevention behaviors among chronically homeless, predominantly African American men and women who transition into permanent supportive housing (PSH). Homeless persons face disproportionate risk of HIV and drug use. PSH is intended as the locus of integrated health services for this vulnerable population, yet there has been almost no research to understand HIV risk and prevention among residents, or the provision of HIV prevention services within PSH, except specifically for people living with HIV/AIDS. Some evidence suggests that transitioning to housing could increase rather than decrease risk behaviors over time, although research to clarify these complexities is absent.  Specific Aims are as follows: 1) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 2) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with changes in social networks of PSH residents, and how networks are associated with changes in HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 3) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with changes in drug use and mental health symptoms among PSH residents, and how changes in these individual characteristics are associated with HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 4) To determine whether and how PSH providers promote HIV prevention, and to understand policies and procedures that may impact HIV risk among residents; 5) To synthesize findings from Aims 1- 4 to inform specific strategies to reduce risk of HIV transmission and to enhance HIV prevention services for residents in PSH.  Aims 1-3 will be addressed through structured interviews (baseline, 3, 6, 12 months) with consecutive admissions to PSH (N=405 at 12 months). Aim 4 will be addressed through individual interviews with supervisory staff (N=30) and focus groups with front line staff (N=100) of PSH programs, and ethnographic shadowing of PSH residents (N=30). Aim 5 will synthesize findings of Aims 1-4 through focus groups with 50 PSH providers and 50 residents.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The planned study is relevant to the public health because of its focus on understanding and reducing HIV risk in a highly vulnerable population: chronically homeless, predominantly African American individuals. The U.S. is investing in housing and supportive health services for chronically homeless persons yet faces a knowledge gap in the delivery of HIV prevention services to this population.                    ","HIV Risk, Drug Use, Social Networks: Homeless Persons Transitioned to Housing",8709798,R01DA036345,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Homeless persons ', ' Housing ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Shadowing ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Social Network ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' sexually active ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' transitionally housed ', ' transitional housing ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' supportive housing ', ' supported housing ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2014,670559,-0.019691306227088572
"Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM Project Summary/Abstract Racial/ethnic disparities in HIV have been a hallmark of the US HIV epidemic for decades, with black/African Americans experiencing higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans. These disparities are also observed in men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom the highest incidence rates are in young black/African American MSM (YBAAMSM). Despite a rich literature demonstrating the prevalent levels of drug and alcohol use among MSM and the potential relationships between these substances and high-risk sexual behaviors, individual risk behaviors do not explain why black MSM and YBAAMSM are more likely to become infected with HIV, compared to other MSM. Studies of self-reported use have collectively demonstrated no greater substance use among black MSM than among white MSM. However, a key finding of our previous R01, which examined factors associated with prevalent and incident HIV infection among a prospective cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta, was that black MSM had substantially lower validity of self-reported drug use, compared to white MSM. Biomarker-classified drug use was also more predictive of HIV seroconversions than self-reported sexual behavior measures, suggesting that, in this population, substance use may be a marker of high-risk partners and environments. Furthermore, the racial disparity in prevalent HIV infection was most associated with differences in network and community factors rather than individual factors. Despite emerging data on sexual partners and structures among YBAAMSM, little is known about the overlap of sexual and substance-use networks, though this might amplify HIV/STI transmission risk. Therefore, we propose to conduct a new prospective cohort study of 300 HIV-negative YBAAMSM in Atlanta, GA, to understand prospective patterns of biomarker-supported substance use in YBAAMSM, as well as its antecedents, contexts, and consequences. This new project will build on the strong institutional infrastructure, community partnerships, theoretical frameworks, analytical approaches, and multidisciplinary research that contributed to the success of our previous cohort study. Results will provide a more detailed understanding of the multilevel associations between substance use and HIV risk, and will yield new opportunities for combination interventions that address the syndemics of HIV/STI and drug use among YBAAMSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Profound disparities in HIV incidence exist for young black/African American MSM compared to other subgroups of MSM. Substance use is prevalent and associated with HIV infection for young black/African American MSM, but the mechanisms by which substances impart added HIV risk are unclear. A cohort study of HIV-negative black MSM ages 18-29 is proposed to further understanding of the relationships between substances and HIV/STI incidence and risk behaviors, and suggest possible interventions.            ",Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM,8770948,R01DA038196,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Cocaine ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' marijuana ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana use ', ' Marijuana Smoking ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Community Networks ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' HIV risk ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Sentinel ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validity of Self Report ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,681887,0.048950165357782495
"Peer-driven Intervention to Seek, Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 21% of HIV infections in the U.S. are undiagnosed, but only about 40% of all adults have been tested. Thus, late diagnosis of HIV is common, and, furthermore, treatment delays and disruptions are widespread. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to test for HIV, are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late, and experience serious barriers to entering care compared to other groups. Our research team has studied HHR in New York City (NYC) as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) studies. We found an HIV prevalence rate of 7.4% among HHR in NYC, and only 6% of these infections had been previously diagnosed. Further, in central Brooklyn, 10% were newly diagnosed with HIV. The proposed study will use NHBS methodology to target HHR. Reduced rates of HIV testing and treatment among HHR are due to structural (e.g., poor access), social (e.g., peer norms), and individual-level (e.g., low perceived risk) barriers. Thus active recruitment approaches modeled after NHBS are needed to overcome structural barriers, and peer-delivered interventions effectively reduce individual and social barriers to testing and treatment. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-level enhanced peer-driven intervention (PDI) to seek, test, treat and retain HHR. The enhanced PDI is tailored specifically for HHR and includes computerized, navigation, and peer-delivered components to enhance future sustainability. The design of the intervention is guided by the Theories of Triadic Influence and Normative Regulation. Similar to NHBS, the enhanced PDI will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS). NHBS protocols use both venue-based sampling (VBS) and RDS for reaching populations at high risk. However, VBS and RDS have not yet been directly compared in terms of their yield of undiagnosed HIV infections. Thus the specific aims of this five-year proposed study are to: (1) compare the yield and efficiency of RDS and VBS to identify undiagnosed HIV infection among HHR; (2) measure the efficacy of an enhanced PDI compared to a control in terms of time to HIV care and HAART initiation, viral load suppression, and retention among those newly diagnosed; (3) examine whether the effects of the PDI on HIV health/treatment outcomes are mediated by changes in individual (e.g., perceived risk), social (e.g., peer norms), and structural influences (e.g., enhanced access), and/or whether other factors (e.g., substance use) moderate its effects; and (4) to project the costs and cost-effectiveness of RDS vs. VBS and PDI. We will conduct the enhanced PDI (N=3000) in central Brooklyn, a location hyperendemic for HIV and where HHR experience poor access to testing and treatment. Simultaneously, VBS (N=400) will be undertaken in central Brooklyn. The proposed study complements local and national HIV prevention initiatives and is designed to contribute an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. The vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino; therefore the proposed study may also impact racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to have been tested for HIV, do not test as frequently, and are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late compared to other risk groups. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to develop an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. Because the vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino, the project has great potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.","Peer-driven Intervention to Seek, Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV",8843569,R01DA032083,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appointment ', ' Attention ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' LAV-2 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 2 ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type IV ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 ', ' HTLV-IV ', ' HIV2 ', ' HIV-II ', ' HIV-2 ', ' Infection ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Respondent ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' episodic drinker ', ' bout drinker ', ' binge drinker ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' surveillance study ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,154638,0.006129866322935212
"Beliefs and decision-making about HPV vaccination among young men who have sex wi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk of anal cancer as a result of prevalent anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in this population. Prophylactic vaccination is a potentially effective public health strategy for preventing anal cancer. A quadrivalent vaccine is currently approved for the prevention of anal cancer and anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in both males and females. As a result, routine vaccination is recommended for all MSM up through at 26. Maximizing vaccine uptake among populations of MSM will require public health interventions to address factors influencing vaccine acceptability, intentions, and subsequent behavior. Currently, public health educators have limited information available to effectively tailor health education messages and interventions aimed at increasing HPV vaccine uptake among vaccine-eligible adult MSM. The Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) is a viable theoretical framework from which to understand HPV vaccine decision-making and to guide social and culturally tailored interventions. According to this model, health education interventions must address the salient HPV-related beliefs and perceptions expressed by young MSM in order to effectively promote vaccination. The long-term goal of this research is to decrease the incidence of anal cancer among MSM by preventing infection of HPV types -16 and -18 through vaccination. The purpose of the proposed research is to understand the factors important to young MSM when making decisions about HPV vaccination by addressing the following specific aims: (1a) Describe salient outcome, normative, and control beliefs related to HPV vaccination among young MSM; (1b) determine factors that underlie these beliefs through semi-structured qualitative interviews and a structured open-ended qualitative survey; (2) explore the influence of socio-demographic characteristics, such as age and racial/ethnic background, in HPV vaccine decision-making among young MSM; and (3) identify information needs and trusted sources of information regarding HPV vaccination among young MSM. These objectives will be addressed in a multi-method sequential qualitative study including semi-structured interviews (Phase 1) and an open-ended qualitative survey (Phase 2) of MSM 18 to 26 years old. The proposed research will reinforce the applicants training plan in cancer epidemiology, the public health needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations, and the use of qualitative methods in health education research. Through a combination of coursework, directed study, and mentorship from his sponsorship team, the proposed training plan will ensure that the applicant will obtain the level of knowledge and skills necessary to build a program of research that will address the critical public health needs of LGBT populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to a variety of cancers affecting women and men.

"Intervention Development for Social Stress, Mental Health, and HIV Risk Among MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are the population most severely affected by HIV in the U.S. and one of the only risk groups in the U.S. for which new infections continue to rise. MSM also experience a vastly disproportionate risk of mental health disorders, especially depression and anxiety. Numerous studies have shown that this mental health disparity arises from the early and ongoing stressors, known as minority stress, that MSM experience related to their sexual orientation. Despite the fact that minority stress is strongly related to anxiety and depression, and that minority stress and related mental health problems synergistically propel HIV risk behaviors, no existing HIV prevention intervention targets minority stress in order to reduce MSM's HIV risk behavior. This project aims to develop a theoretically-driven intervention that reduces the health-depleting effects of minority stress through targeting the basic psychosocial mechanisms linking minority stress to HIV risk behavior. These mechanisms include maladaptive emotion regulation, negative thinking styles, low self-efficacy, avoidance, and impulsivity, which are the very targets of an existing cognitive-behavioral, manualized intervention--the Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UPTTED). The UPTTED changes these mechanisms using motivational interviewing, interoceptive and situational exposure, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness, and self-monitoring exercises, all grounded in cognitive-behavioral principles and developmental and affective neuroscience models of stress. The proposed study will adapt the UPTTED to support high-risk MSM's adaptive coping with minority stress, alleviate associated depression and anxiety, and reduce HIV risk behavior. The adapted UPTTED is expected to increase awareness of the unhealthy impact of minority stress; facilitate objective self-schemas in the face of minority stress; and strengthen one's skills and self-efficacy for managing minority stress and associated anxiety and depression to reduce risk for acquiring HIV. MSM who have experienced minority stress, mental health problems, and HIV risk behavior in the previous 3 months (n = 30) and community health experts (n = 30) will provide suggestions for adaptations to the existing intervention manual, including culturally relevant vignettes, examples, and exercises for adaptively responding to minority stress and managing HIV risk. The feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention will then be tested in a randomized waitlist controlled trial with MSM (n = 60) who report recent experiences with minority stress, depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behavior. The primary outcome will be HIV risk behavior. Secondary outcomes will be reductions in mediators including depression, anxiety, and the mechanisms of the conceptual model. This project innovatively seeks to test the preliminary efficacy of the first theoretically-driven intervention targeting the mental and sexual health consequences of minority stress and does so by targeting the underlying mechanisms that powerfully drive these simultaneous health threats.          Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. and one of the only risk groups in the U.S. for which new HIV infection rates are increasing. By addressing fundamental sources of HIV risk among MSM, including minority stress and associated mental health difficulties, the intervention developed in this project can reduce HIV risk behavior among MSM and therefore the spread of HIV.

"A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Bruthas Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW) are at particular risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and represent a priority population for developing effective interventions. Despite the urgent need for effective prevention approaches for AAMSMW, to our knowledge no evidence-based HIV interventions have been developed and tested for this population. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of the Bruthas Project, an individual-level HIV prevention intervention, which builds on standardized HIV counseling and testing. Delivered in a series of four sessions by trained African American male counselors, the BP focuses on reviewing HIV transmission routes for male and female partners, strengthening sexual communication skills with both male and female partners, and improving condom use skills and other safer sex negotiation strategies. A randomized controlled trial of BP is necessary to determine the efficacy of the intervention and can lead to improved public health efforts at reducing HIV risk behavior among AAMSMW and in the African American community more generally. To evaluate the effect of the BP, we will recruit and enroll a cohort of 400 AAMSMW who will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition, in which they will be offered BP, or to the comparison condition, in which they will receive standardized HIV testing and counseling with referral to case management. We will follow the cohort over 9 months and will assess participants at three time points: baseline, 3 months follow-up, and 6 months follow- up.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to respond to the HIV epidemic in the African American community is a national public health priority. Men account for more than half of HIV infections among African Americans. We have worked diligently over the past four years to develop a HIV prevention intervention for African American men who have sex with men and women (AAMSMW), the Bruthas Project. No controlled intervention studies to date have proven to be effective in significantly lowering HIV-related risk behavior for AAMSMW. Given the urgency of the epidemic among African Americans in general, and African American MSM in particular, a large scale randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to test the efficacy of this promising HIV prevention intervention for these men, and if it is found to be effective, to move it quickly into practice.

"Adapting the SiSTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW Prevention Trilogy for Black Men      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adapting the SISTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW HIV Prevention Trilogy  for Black Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have been disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic. Yet, there are very few scientifically demonstrated effective HIV prevention interventions targeting Black MSM. This SBIR Phase II project will address this gap and fill an important product niche for community-based organizations, health departments and clinics serving Black MSM by creating (1) a modular program package and online program builder to support the delivery of the popular SISTA/SIHLE/WILLOW HIV prevention suite with Black MSM; (2) an interactive, computer-delivered version of the adapted program; and (3) an online forum to provide updated resources and enable practitioners to share program implementation concerns and experiences. We will also conduct a 3-arm, quasi-experimental outcome study in three states to assess the effectiveness of these programs in reducing HIV risk behaviors among Black MSM. The project offers many innovations, including  the creation of the first evidence-based computer-delivered HIV prevention program specifically designed for Black MSM;  the development of a modular program package and online program builder to tailor program content for different sub-populations of Black MSM; the presentation of risk reduction activities within an explicit sexual health/harm reduction framework, an approach called for by practitioners and public health officials in recent years (Goldhanner & Mayer, 2011; Grossman et al., 2011; Wolitski & Fenton, 2011);  a discussion of the pros and cons of pre- exposure prophylaxis (PREP) as an HIV prevention strategy;  the inclusion of ""seroadaptive"" risk reduction practices (Wei et al., 2011) in the outcome study to assess the wide range of harm reduction practices currently practiced by Black MSM; and an online practitioner forum. In sum, the project's combination of a modular adaptation package, online program builder, computer-delivered intervention and practitioner forum provides a model to support the cost-effective implementation of evidence-based programs on a wide range of public health issues in diver implementation contexts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States, and Black MSM aged 18-29 have the highest new HIV infection rate of any group of MSM or African-Americans. This project will help reduce new HIV infections among Black MSM by (1) developing a version of the popular SISTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW HIV prevention trilogy specifically tailored for implementation with Black MSM; (2) creating a 2.5 hour long, computer-delivered version of the adapted program; and (3) conducting a quasi-experimental 3-arm trial to test the effectiveness of these programs. The project's combination of a modular adaptation package, online program builder, and computer-delivered intervention provides a model to support the cost-effective implementation of evidence-based programs to address a wide range of public health issues. The outcome study data will also further our understanding of how harm reduction strategies and computer technologies can be utilized to reduce disease risk and promote healthy behaviors more generally.            ",Adapting the SiSTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW Prevention Trilogy for Black Men ,8687739,R44MD005812,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Grant ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Language ', ' Love ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Play ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Sum ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Evidence based program ', ' usability ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,SOCIOMETRICS CORPORATION,R44,2014,585610,0.15415268518426384
"RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV, interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present, only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. Our team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect, reductions in stimulant use, improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count, and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed randomized controlled trial addresses a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM). By utilizing contingency management as the platform for the delivery of an innovative positive affect intervention, this research could identify the first efficacious integrative intervention for promoting long-term reductions in HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM. Efficacious interventions for this population are desperately needed to alleviate human suffering associated with substance abuse as well as optimize health outcomes and decrease HIV transmission rates.            ",RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users,8601064,R01DA033854,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Couples ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' sex abstinence ', ' not sexually active ', ' celibate ', ' abstaining from sex ', ' abstain from sexual intercouse ', ' abstain from sexual activity ', ' abstain from intercouse ', ' Celibacy ', ' Sexual Abstinence ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Measures ', ' free base cocaine ', ' Crack Cocaine ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' improved ', ' Phlebotomy ', ' Venous blood sampling ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' contingency management ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Regulation ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Population Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' resistance strain ', ' resistant strain ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,542055,0.08931327555861968
"Health,Hope and Healing:A National conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW Abstract  The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities and is on par with those found in several African countries. HIV directly or indirectly related to men having sex with men is the single largest contributor to HIV infection among Blacks, accounting for nearly half of all cases among Black men. Despite large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV prevalence and risk, just one tested intervention specifically for Black men who have sex with men (MSM) has been published. Furthermore, Black men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) have been particularly underserved and underrepresented in HIV research. Attention must be lent to address the behavioral, psychological, socio-cultural, and biomedical factors, as well as the racial/ethnic disparities that exist and contribute to HIV infection and transmission among Black MSM and MSMW. This 5-year R13 conference grant proposal entitled, Health, Hope and Healing (H3): A National Conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW, will assemble the best minds currently studying HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW. The H3 conference series, with an annual meeting over five years, aims to advance HIV biobehavioral research, mentor junior investigators, and foster community based participatory collaborations. The three measurable conference outcomes are to: 1) Produce an executive report detailing the long term research, training and policy agenda, highlighting recommendations designed to reduce HIV in Black MSM and MSMW; 2) Produce an executive report detailing successful mentorship of junior investigators; and 3) Develop successful community based participatory research collaboratives, as measured by the submission of at least one joint proposal that operationalizes the research. The H3 Conference series will be among the first to discuss the needs of Black MSM and MSMW within a holistic and socio-cultural paradigm and disseminate research findings and healthcare and policy recommendations for eliminating HIV/AIDS within this population. Project Narrative  The HIV epidemic has reached alarming rates in the United States especially within Black communities. Researchers, clinicians, community members and congressman have all advocated for more attention to this epidemic. The proposed Health, Hope and Healing conference will gather the best minds currently studying HIV among Black MSM and MSMW. This conference aims to advance research, mentor junior investigators, foster community based participatory collaborations and disseminate findings and recommendations for the purpose of eliminating HIV/AIDS among Black MSM and MSMW.","Health,Hope and Healing:A National conference on HIV among Black MSM and MSMW",8625337,R13MH089835,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Archives ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Videotape ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Healed ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Monograph ', ' programs ', ' fighting ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Manuscripts ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Measurable ', ' Research Training ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' healing ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' MSMW ', ' men who have sex with men and women ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R13,2014,49176,0.04421181200055216
"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Morehouse School of Medicine Prevention Research Center (MSM PRC) seeks continued funding through the 2014-2019 period. MSM PRC conducts interdisciplinary community-based prevention research in African American and other minority communities; trains minority community-based researchers and public health practitioners; and demonstrates the value of community coalitions in conducting research. MSM PRC is governed by a Community Coalition Board (CCB) that represents a partnership between the City of Atlanta's Neighborhood Planning Units T, V, X, Y and Z, three academic institutions and seven agencies (inclusive of state and local health departments). The CCB serves as a governing body with the majority being comprised of community residents and its Chair is always a community representative. Our research addresses priorities set by the CCB and the leading causes of health disparities and health problems in their communities.  The proposed core intervention research project seeks to expand MSM PRC's research scope and focus on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI's) among adolescents ages 14-18. The research to be undertaken is designed to address gaps in the efficacy and effectiveness literature related to HIV and STI prevention among African American youth. This research will address gender differences, the efficacy of a multi-component intervention vs. a single component intervention, and the efficacy of including parents in the intervention.  We propose a health promotion research intervention that will reach youth at local Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA's and community organizations using social media in a major social marketing campaign. The research will compare the effectiveness of four aims. Aim #1 will use the ""Be a Responsible Teen"" intervention; Aim #2 will include a social marketing intervention and a parental component; Aim #3 will be based on the HIV-RAAP intervention and will incorporate media literacy; and Aim #4 will constitute a comparison group.

"Developing and Pilot Testing a Mobile Phone-Based HIV/STI Prevention Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is submitted in response to the alarming rates of HIV among young African American men who have sex with men (MSM). The CDC recently reported that between 2006 and 2009, HIV incidence was stable among all populations in the US except young MSM. The overall increase in incidence among young MSM was driven by a 48% increase in HIV infections among young African American MSM. The broad, long-term objective of this research is to identify strategies to reduce the rates of HIV in young African American MSM. This research will take advantage of the men's avid use of mobile phone technology to deliver an innovative intervention to change their sexual risk behavior. The Specific Aims are to: 1) develop an interactive mobile phone-based HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention that is acceptable and feasible to be implemented with African American MSM ages 18 to 24 years; 2) develop an acceptable and feasible text-messaging adjunctive strategy designed to increase its efficacy; 3) pilot test the efficacy of the HIV/STI risk-reductio intervention compared with an attention-control intervention in increasing the proportion of men who report consistent condom use during anal and vaginal intercourse; and 4) pilot test whether the efficacy of the HIV/STI risk-reduction compared with the control intervention is enhanced among men randomized to the tailored text-messaging adjunctive intervention as compared with other men. African American men ages 18 to 24 years who report having anal intercourse with a man in the 2 months prior to screening will be eligible to participate. The intervention and adjunctive strategy will be developed using an iterative process involving focus groups, input from a community advisory board, usability testing, and small-scale pilot testing. Evidence of potential efficacy will be based on a pilot randomized controlled trial involving 180 men with 6-month follow-up. Men will be randomly assigned to the HIV/STI risk-reduction or an attention-control intervention. In addition, they will be randomly assigned to receive or not receive intervention-specific, individually tailored text messages. The approach draws on social cognitive theory and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with the target population. Self-reported consistent condom use, other sexual behaviors, HIV testing, and variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy will be collected via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing. The use of a mobile phone technology for intervention would allay participants' concerns about revealing their sexual involvement with men by virtue of participating in a group or workshop intervention. If current trends in smartphone use continue, this research has the potential to produce a cost-effective intervention that local, state, or national organizations might offer to their young African American MSM clients. The proposed research has great public health significance because although young African American MSM have some of the highest rates of HIV in the US, there is a paucity of efficacious HIV/STI interventions tailored to them.          Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to account for the largest number of new HIV  cases in the US, and the rates of newly diagnosed HIV in young African American MSM are  especially high, rivaling those in many sub-Saharan African nations.  Yet, no published  randomized controlled trial has tested HIV/STI risk-reduction interventions for young African  American MSM. These men are avid users of mobile phones, and if current trends in smartphone ownership continue, the potential product of this research, if successful, might be a cost-effective intervention that local, state, or national organizations can offer to thir young African American MSM clients.

"RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV, interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present, only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. Our team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect, reductions in stimulant use, improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count, and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed randomized controlled trial addresses a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM). By utilizing contingency management as the platform for the delivery of an innovative positive affect intervention, this research could identify the first efficacious integrative intervention for promoting long-term reductions in HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM.

"Syndemics and resilience for HIV transmission in a national sample of vulnerable DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay and bisexual men (GBM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 63% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2010 -they are among the only population in which infections are actually rising. The syndemics model has been applied to MSM finding considerable empirical support for a model in which several specific co-occurring psychosocial health problems (e.g., depression, substance use, trauma from childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence) compound risk for HIV. Yet this model does not account for resilience in the face of syndemic factors-there are GBM who experience syndemics and yet do not engage in hazardous (i.e., HIV risk) behavior. Yet, resilience too is not well understood among GBM. The proposed study builds from the syndemics framework by investigating patterns of resilience in a national US sample of GBM. We have partnered with Harris Interactive, Inc., a research firm that maintains the largest and most comprehensive database of GBM, to identify a national sample of 1,000 GBM to participate in a 3- year longitudinal study (Baseline, 12-, 24-, 36-months) investigating patterns and correlates of syndemic, protective, and resilient factors. We propose to collect behavioral and biological outcomes (at-home HIV and STI testing). We will: (1) Determine patterns and prevalence of syndemic factors and risk behavior in a national sample of GBM; (2) Conduct qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants to identify new/unmeasured mechanisms of resilience and to contextualize our quantitative data (Baseline and 36- months); and (3) Longitudinally track trajectories in resilience, syndemics, and HIV and STI incidence to identify psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with these changing trajectories. Our methodological design-including the use of a national sample, longitudinal assessments, biological testing for HIV and STIs-enhances this study's external validity and thus the impact of our findings. And by tracking patterns in syndemics and resilience, this study will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs. Our application addresses an important problem and barrier to progress in the field (a strengths-based approach to HIV prevention among GBM that goes above and beyond general protective factors to examine resilient factors among men with high risk for hazardous behavior). It has potential to improve scientific knowledge regarding HIV prevention efforts with GBM. And understanding resilience in the face of syndemics can change the conceptual approach, treatments, services, and interventions for a population that remains in critical need. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay and bisexual men are disproportionally impacted by HIV and STIs.

"Development of a Smartphone Mobile App for HIV Care and Prevention in YMSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased while the annual number of new infections has remained relatively stable. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly young black/African American MSM (YBMSM), are disproportionately impacted. The number of new cases among people aged 13-29 years increased by 21% from 2006 to 2009, fueled by a 34% increase in HIV infections among young gay and bisexual men. Although MSM represented about 7% of the male population in the United States in 2010, MSM accounted for 78% of new HIV infections among males and 63% of all new infections. Innovation: Smartphone mobile apps present innovative opportunities for discreet, targeted outreach to young MSM (YMSM). HIV care, prevention, and health maintenance interventions, which can be delivered to the subject or their care partner through smartphone apps, have the potential to increase HIV testing, facilitate immediate linkage to appropriate HIV services, encourage early access to treatment, and support sustained health maintenance measures. Preliminary Data: Recent studies explore the use of technology to promote healthy behaviors in various populations. There are several studies that explore the use of technology for MSM. Specifically, a study by Holloway et al (2013) demonstrates promising findings on the acceptability of smartphone application-based HIV prevention among YMSM. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that YMSM in an urban setting: 1) currently utilize smartphone technology and will do so for HIV prevention and health maintenance; 2) will accept and utilize a novel HIV-specific smartphone app for prevention and disease management.; 3) the integration of a smartphone app-based technology will be an effective mechanism to address HIV care and prevention in this population. Specific Aims: Phase I will investigate the feasibility and acceptance of a smartphone app for HIV care and prevention, in collaboration with researchers at Joint AIDS Community Quest for Unique and Effective Treatment Strategies (JACQUES) Initiative of the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (JI) in Baltimore. In Specific Aim 1, we will assess the current smartphone use and willingness of a representative population to use a proposed smartphone app for HIV care and prevention through focus groups and surveys. In Specific Aim 2, we will construct a proof of concept smartphone app with targeted features for HIV prevention and health maintenance. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the proof of concept smartphone app within the target population. These aims will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptance of a novel smartphone mobile app for effective, remote HIV prevention and care for urban YMSM. Environment: CTIS has excellent experience developing mobile technology solutions for healthcare applications. Our partner and subcontractor in this grant application, JI, works closely with the YMSM community at Baltimore providing HIV care, prevention, and outreach services. Collectively we bring together all the capabilities required to successfully execute the Phase I feasibility study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM), particularly YMSM of color, are significantly impacted by HIV infection, demonstrating disproportionate rates of HIV transmission and poorer treatment outcomes once infected, including increased mortality. This proposed project will examine the feasibility of use and acceptance of a smart phone app based technology to positively impact HIV prevention and care of YMSM in an urban setting. Ultimately, researchers aim to reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes in YMSM living with, or at disproportionate risk of, HIV infection.            ",Development of a Smartphone Mobile App for HIV Care and Prevention in YMSM,8790386,R43MD009558,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Solutions ', ' Survey Method ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Sample Size ', ' Gays ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Apple ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Human Virology ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' ']",NIMHD,"CTIS, INC.",R43,2014,135523,0.0032244743024594513
"Behavioral and institutional barriers to HIV prevention among migrant women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for collaborative U.S.-Russia research on HIV prevention among migrant women in the Russian Federation is submitted to the NIH in conjunction with a parallel application submitted by the Russian collaborators to the Russian Foundation for Basic Research. It builds upon the international team's completed and current NIH-supported pilot work in Russia as well as the US investigators' extensive cross-national research on migration and HIV. It proposes a novel combination of population-level quantitative and qualitative analyses with analyses of institutional dynamics to describe HIV risks of irregular female migrants from three Central Asian countries- Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan and to identify challenges and barriers in HIV prevention and mitigation faced by this vulnerable group. Specifically, the study will collect statistically representative survey data on migrant women from Central Asia in two Russian cities recruited through respondent driven sampling and qualitative information from a subsample of those women and their sexual partners. In addition, institutional ethnographies, including interviews with service providers and observations of provider-client interactions, will be carried out at clinics offering sexual and reproductive health and HIV/STI services to migrant women. The analyses will focus on: women's negotiation of HIV risk reduction with their sexual partners; women's use of their personal networks to obtain information about HIV risks and prevention, to evaluate their risks, and to take actions aimed at reducing those risks; and women's interactions with the formal health care sector and the provider- client gaps and disconnects that characterize those interactions. The results of this exploratory study will lay the foundation for subsequent design and testing of culturally-grounded, gender-sensitive, nationally-scalable interventions aimed at reducing the risks of HIV infection among migrant women and improving their access to HIV counseling, testing, and treatment services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed US-Russian collaborative study will examine HIV risks and barriers to HIV prevention among migrant women from Central Asia in the Russian Federation.

"Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This mentored research project will investigate an under-researched aspect of HIV in Africa: the HIV prevention needs of female migrants. Migration and HIV research has almost exclusively focused on HIV risks to male migrants, often failing to measure the risks to women via their involvement in migration. Yet across the region, women's levels of participation in migration have met or exceeded those of men. Moreover, the few studies which have examined HIV risks to female migrants found higher risk behavior and HIV prevalence in migrant compared to non-migrant women. My dissertation study found that migration was associated with a higher risk of HIV infection in women than in men in South Africa. The finding warrants confirmation in East Africa, where HIV/AIDS is devastating communities and the sex disparity in infection risk is striking. HIV prevalence levels in Nyanza Province, Kenya are among the highest in Africa. Previous studies have found high levels of participation in migration by both men and women in Kenya and higher sexual risk behaviors among migrants than non-migrants. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which participation in migration leads to higher risk behavior in women. My proposed plan will address this gap. It is comprised of two phases: a secondary data analysis, and an in-depth qualitative study in Kenya. These two 'modules' will address the following aims: (1) Assess the degree to which HIV infection in women in Kenya is influenced by their participation in migration, and identify explanatory mechanisms by which women's migration may increase their HIV risks. I will use secondary data from Kenya Demographic and Health and AIDS Indicator Surveys and demographic surveillance field sites to carry out analyses to achieve this aim. Using 'HIV Triangulation', I will evaluate these findings along with information from other sources in participatory workshops with local stakeholders in Kenya. This exercise will inform the design of the qualitative study to be carried out in Aim 2: (2) Characterize social and psychological aspects of women's migration experience in Nyanza Province, Kenya which facilitate their risks of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. I will use participant observation and in-depth interviews to characterize the spatial and social features of the common destinations of female migrants, and identify the structural and psychological aspects of women's migration that influence their HIV infection risks. These antecedents to HIV infection in female migrants serve as potential points of HIV prevention intervention, thus laying the groundwork for Aim 3: (3) Develop a preliminary plan for a multi-level HIV prevention intervention with female migrants in Nyanza. In participatory workshops with local stakeholders, I will critically evaluate the cumulative findings of this research, identify potential points of intervention with female migrants, assess acceptability of various options, and develop a preliminary intervention plan. At the start of year 4 I will submit an R34 application to the NIMH for a formative study to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Project Narrative  The research proposed in this application examines the overlooked role that women's  participation in migration may play in sustaining an enormous HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan  Africa. This research will be significant because it will provide the first comprehensive  investigation of the mechanisms through which migration increases HIV risk among women in  the region. A better understanding of women's patterns of migration and mechanisms through  which migration increases HIV risk is necessary both to improve our capacity to control HIV and  to respond to future emerging infectious disease threats.",Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya,8595333,K01MH093205,"['Academic Training ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Survey ', ' Epidemic ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Kenya ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Internal Migrations ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Africa ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' Female Roles ', "" Women's Role "", ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' high risk behavior ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Province ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' population movement ', ' migratory population ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2014,171389,0.006168126547521307
"Peer-driven Intervention to Seek, Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 21% of HIV infections in the U.S. are undiagnosed, but only about 40% of all adults have been tested. Thus, late diagnosis of HIV is common, and, furthermore, treatment delays and disruptions are widespread. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to test for HIV, are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late, and experience serious barriers to entering care compared to other groups. Our research team has studied HHR in New York City (NYC) as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) studies. We found an HIV prevalence rate of 7.4% among HHR in NYC, and only 6% of these infections had been previously diagnosed. Further, in central Brooklyn, 10% were newly diagnosed with HIV. The proposed study will use NHBS methodology to target HHR. Reduced rates of HIV testing and treatment among HHR are due to structural (e.g., poor access), social (e.g., peer norms), and individual-level (e.g., low perceived risk) barriers. Thus active recruitment approaches modeled after NHBS are needed to overcome structural barriers, and peer-delivered interventions effectively reduce individual and social barriers to testing and treatment. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-level enhanced peer-driven intervention (PDI) to seek, test, treat and retain HHR. The enhanced PDI is tailored specifically for HHR and includes computerized, navigation, and peer-delivered components to enhance future sustainability. The design of the intervention is guided by the Theories of Triadic Influence and Normative Regulation. Similar to NHBS, the enhanced PDI will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS). NHBS protocols use both venue-based sampling (VBS) and RDS for reaching populations at high risk. However, VBS and RDS have not yet been directly compared in terms of their yield of undiagnosed HIV infections. Thus the specific aims of this five-year proposed study are to: (1) compare the yield and efficiency of RDS and VBS to identify undiagnosed HIV infection among HHR; (2) measure the efficacy of an enhanced PDI compared to a control in terms of time to HIV care and HAART initiation, viral load suppression, and retention among those newly diagnosed; (3) examine whether the effects of the PDI on HIV health/treatment outcomes are mediated by changes in individual (e.g., perceived risk), social (e.g., peer norms), and structural influences (e.g., enhanced access), and/or whether other factors (e.g., substance use) moderate its effects; and (4) to project the costs and cost-effectiveness of RDS vs. VBS and PDI. We will conduct the enhanced PDI (N=3000) in central Brooklyn, a location hyperendemic for HIV and where HHR experience poor access to testing and treatment. Simultaneously, VBS (N=400) will be undertaken in central Brooklyn. The proposed study complements local and national HIV prevention initiatives and is designed to contribute an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. The vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino; therefore the proposed study may also impact racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.        Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to have been tested for HIV, do not test as frequently, and are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late compared to other risk groups. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to develop an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. Because the vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino, the project has great potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.

"Developing and Implementing a Cancer Prevention and Control Research Curriculum t DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop and execute a cancer prevention and control curriculum training program at the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) that will help prepare professional students in public health and in the biomedical sciences for positions in cancer prevention and control research. The curriculum will be based on a framework for addressing cancer prevention and control from bench to bedside to community and will emphasize research targeted at reduction and elimination of cancer disparities. It will include courses that will provide the students with a suitable knowledge base in the areas of cancer epidemiology and cancer prevention and control and that will teach them how to do research in cancer prevention and control and to develop interventions to reduce disparities; practicum experiences designed to enhance the understanding and application of knowledge and research findings in cancer prevention and control to public health settings by providing an opportunity to gain practical experience, at an appropriate level and content, in the field of cancer prevention and control; and opportunities to conduct research in cancer prevention and control under the guidance of cancer researchers. The faculty of this training program will be drawn from the various graduate teaching programs at MSM, thereby integrating it into MSM training programs. The curriculum will be developed in year one, and it will be offered to students in MSM's Master of Public Health, Master of Science in Clinical Research, Doctor of Medicine and Minority Summer Public Health Fellowship programs. An evaluation plan will be implemented to constantly monitor the program and assess its success in achieving its goals and objectives, and the results will be used for ongoing improvement.     Project Narrative  There is a tremendous need in the US to increase the number of minority scientists,  particularly in academic medicine. Although African Americans suffer from major health  disparities, less than 1% of investigator-initiated grant dollars go to Historically Black  Colleges/Universities (HBCU) and less than 1% of R01-funded research is awarded to  African American researchers. This R25 grant will help to ensure that investigators at the  Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), an HBCU, can play a major role in cancer  research by creating a cadre of public health and health care professionals at MSM who  have an increased capacity to describe health disparities related to cancer and  associated mechanisms over time and across the cancer continuum, and by  strengthening the skills and level of competence of MSM graduates in preparation for  their inclusion in the public health workforce in the field of cancer prevention and control.",Developing and Implementing a Cancer Prevention and Control Research Curriculum t,8733578,R25CA136438,"['Alabama ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' graduate medical education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' Prevention Research ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' M.P.H.

"HIV Prevention Tablet for Minority-Focused Effective Behavioral Interventions     DESCRIPTION: NIH and CDC continue to prioritize efforts to decrease HIV transmission rates and increase care for people living with HIV, especially among minority populations that are disproportionately carrying the weight of the epidemic. Despite the success of effective behavioral interventions (EBIs) among diverse high-risk populations and significant resources dedicated to replicating them, many factors still obstruct the wide dissemination and sustained implementation of these EBIs, such as lack of technical assistance, organizational capacity, staff buy-in, program fit, and challenges to adaptation. Harnessing the recent proliferation of mobile tablet computers and their increasing use in pedagogy and healthcare, this project will leverage the specific benefits afforded by tablets (personalization, connectedness, mobility, and improved learning outcomes) to improve the implementation and diffusion of HIV prevention EBIs aimed at populations of special interest to NIH's National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD). These population groups include ""racial and ethnic minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians and other U.S. Pacific Islanders), socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and medically underserved individuals residing in rural and urban areas"" (NCMHD website). We will develop a self- contained application, Prevention Tablet (PTab), to help program facilitators overcome identified barriers to implementation. PTab will be the first mobile application to be designed especially for EBI facilitators working in real-world settings. Facilitators can use PTab on a tablet computer anytime, anywhere to access all program content as well as core features tailored for their current tasks, whether preparing for implementation, while running a session, or immediately after a session. PTab will have tools like digital note-taking, reminders to prepare materials, on-screen timers for session outlines to ensure coverage of core elements, and digital forms to streamline process evaluation. With an Internet connection, facilitators will have access to supplementary content, training refreshers, and strategies from other program facilitators through integrated links to an online community of practice. In Phase I, we will test the feasibility of the PTab concept by: conducting a needs assessment of EBI managers and implementers, building a prototype Prevention Tablet for one minority- focused HIV prevention program, and usability testing the prototype with representatives of PTab's target market. If PTab proves feasible and useful, we will submit a Phase II proposal to: improve the design and usability of PTab based on the Phase I usability study; conduct a field study to assess if and how access to PTab improves organizational adoption of EBIs, implementation fidelity, and sustainability; and develop PTab modules for 10-15 select minority-focused HIV prevention EBIs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities in HIV incidence and prevalence remain significant in the U.S., with minority and medically underserved populations being disproportionately affected. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of select behavioral interventions in reducing HIV-related risk behaviors among diverse groups, including those suffering from health disparities. Nevertheless, adoption and appropriate implementation of EBIs (effective behavioral interventions) remain challenging to frontline HIV prevention providers. Finding new solutions that take into account current barriers to adoption as well as program facilitators' practical difficulties with implementation is imperative to ensuring the successful replication of EBIs in real-world settings. The proposed PTab product will harness HIV prevention EBI content compiled at Sociometrics over the last two decades, a new online community of practice website being developed around these EBIs, a user-focused product development methodology, and the latest in mobile tablet hardware and software technology to facilitate adoption and sustained, appropriate use of HIV prevention EBIs aimed at minority and medically underserved populations. If successful, PTab will, in this manner, contribute to reducing HIV-related health disparities.                ",HIV Prevention Tablet for Minority-Focused Effective Behavioral Interventions,8730377,R43MD008851,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Marketing ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Gays ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' field study ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Community Practice ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' minority health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' medically underserved ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' improving mobility ', ' product development ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' ']",NIMHD,SOCIOMETRICS CORPORATION,R43,2014,210280,0.039532180244497714
"Using Sexual Network Transmission Models to Explain HIV Disparities Between Black     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, disparities in HIV between black and white men who have sex with men (MSM) are large and unexplained. Individual behavioral reasons for these disparities have been generally dismissed as possible explanations. Network explanations have proven useful in understanding persistent disparities in STI burdens in other populations, and have been hypothesized to explain racial/ethnic disparities in US MSM. However, these hypotheses have not been tested using modeling approaches for two reasons. First, there have historically been inadequate data to parameterize models with respect to critical network characteristics, such as concurrency, transitivity, and assortative mixing by key characteristics. Second, model structures have not been developed that account for the unique aspects of MSM sexual networks. We propose to develop this understanding by analyzing new data on MSM sexual networks from multiple studies conducted by the investigators in Atlanta, a metropolitan area with large populations of both black and white MSM and significant racial disparities in HIV. We will recall participants in current and recent studies to collect additional data as necessary. Using these new network parameters, we will extend an existing stochastic simulation model of HIV transmission in MSM to reflect these network attributes. This approach will use STERGMs (separable temporal exponential random graph models), which can handle dynamic network data in the form of cross-sectional network structure combined with information on relational duration or dissolution patterns. We will use the expanded, newly parameterized model for two purposes. First, we will use the model to attempt to describe the role of network parameters in black/white disparities in HIV incidence among US MSM. Second, we will use the model to test which modifiable network parameters might have the most potential in reducing HIV incidence, if modified among MSM populations. Completion of these activities is expected to result in the testing of hypotheses about reasons for black/white disparities in HIV among US MSM, modeling tools that will be useful to further evaluation of MSM networks, and specific, proposed targets for new prevention interventions for this most highly impacted community in the US HIV epidemic. Our Specific Aims are: (1) to develop a comprehensive set of individual, dyadic, and triadic network parameters, accounting for transmission potential, for use in an agent-based HIV transmission model for black and white MSM in metropolitan Atlanta; (2) to expand an existing stochastic, agent-based HIV transmission model for MSM to include code for modeling network features for black and white MSM; (3) to utilize this enhanced model and parameters to (a) determine whether racial disparities for HIV observed among Atlanta-area MSM can be explained using existing hypotheses for their sources in combination with our measured network phenomena; (b) identify the highest- impact network properties for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in HIV among US MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most heavily impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic; within this community, large racial differences in HIV prevalence exist, which are not explained by obvious differences in sexual behavior. In this study, we will use existing and newly collected network data, in combination with mathematical modeling, to consider whether multiple aspects of the structure of sexual networks can help explain this disparity. This work offers the potential to answer the persistent question of why some MSM communities have high HIV levels, and to identify future strategies for reducing those levels.",Using Sexual Network Transmission Models to Explain HIV Disparities Between Black,8716791,R21HD075662,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Simulate ', ' tool ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' metropolitan ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,180299,0.14591233910538698

"Couples-Based HIV/STI Prevention for Drug-Involved, African American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to rigorously test the efficacy of a couples-based HIV and sexually transmitted infection (HIV/STI) preventive intervention for African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in same sex intimate relationships in which at least one partner is using stimulants (herein referred to as ""stimulant-using, African American MSM couples""). The proposed study is a logical progression from the investigative team's prior formative research to take an existing couples based intervention originally for heterosexual couples (""Connect"") and revise/tailor it for methamphetamine-using, African American MSM couples. The adapted intervention was pilot tested using a pre-/post-test design. Findings revealed statistically and clinically significant reductions in sexual and drug risk behaviors. In addition, this formative research informs the proposed study in several additional ways: (1) the importance of addressing stimulants beyond methamphetamine with African American MSM; (2) qualitative data on how a couples-based intervention can interrupt relationship dynamics more unique to drug-involved, African American MSM couples that lead to risk behavior; and (3) couples-based HIV prevention research is feasible, promising, and safe for stimulant using, African American MSM. This earlier research has culminated with a 7-session, manualized intervention entitled ""Connect 'n Unite"" (or CNU-pronounced ""seein' you""-for short) as a candidate couples-based HIV preventive intervention for stimulant-using, African American MSM couples. The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with 270 stimulant-using, African American MSM couples to test the impact of CNU versus a wellness promotion (WP) attention control condition on behavioral and biologically assayed outcomes over a 12-month follow-up period. The study has the following primary aims: (1) to test whether participants assigned to CNU engage in lower HIV/STI behavioral risk-fewer number of unprotected acts of anal intercourse, greater proportion of protected acts of anal intercourse, and fewer number of sexual partners-compared to participants assigned to WP; (2) to test whether participants assigned to CNU have lower cumulative incidence of STIs-chlamydia and gonorrhea-confirmed via biological assay compared to participants assigned to WP; and (3) to test whether participants assigned to CNU engage in less drug use and drug-related HIV risk (i.e., sex under the influence of drugs/alcohol) compared to participants assigned to WP. If successful, this study will advance the field by providing an evidence-based, innovative intervention that can be delivered in drug treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using, African American MSM.         This study addresses the overrepresentation of the African American/Black community among those living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. as well as men who have sex with men (MSM), the transmission category that accounts for the majority of HIV infections. In the absence of a vaccine or cure for HIV infection, behavioral risk reduction represents the best public health tool for prevention of HIV transmission. The proposed randomized clinical trial will rigorously test an innovative, couples-based intervention targeting the intersection of stimulant use and sexual risk behavior among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, with the ultimate goal providing an evidence-based intervention that can be delivered in drug treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using, African American/Black MSM.

"Provider and Peer Support Intervention to Improve ART Adherence among Kenyan Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although men who have sex with men (MSM) are at very high risk for HIV globally, this group has only recently become an important focus of national HIV/AIDS programs in sub-Saharan Africa. While it is clear that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and prevent sexual transmission from HIV-infected MSM, little is known about antiretroviral adherence and barriers to care among African MSM. We have worked with MSM involved in sex work on the Kenyan coast since 2005, and have found significant disparities in HIV treatment engagement, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes in this group, due at least in part to stigma and social isolation. Involving bot providers and peers in an intervention to support MSM as they initiate ART, combined with regular messaging to promote adherence, is an innovative strategy to address this treatment gap. In this R34 application, prepared in response to PAR-11-278 ""Discovery, Development, and Testing of Novel Interventions to Advance HIV Prevention and Care,"" we propose a 3-year developmental project to design and pilot test a culturally appropriate and generalizable antiretroviral adherence intervention for African MSM. The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration among experienced investigators at the University of Washington, Kenya Medical Research Institute, University of Oxford, and Brown University, based on a foundation of 7 years' experience conducting research with Kenyan MSM that underpins the significance and innovation of this proposal. Our specific aims are to: (1) conduct qualitative research including in-depth interviews and focus groups with HIV-1-seropositive MSM, treatment-experienced peers, and their providers to identify common barriers and likely facilitators of ART adherence; (2) design and field test a theoretically driven intervention for MSM combining provider and peer support to encourage engagement in care, build trust, and deliver regular adherence messaging; and (3) implement a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the resulting multi-component intervention versus standard care with 60 MSM participants. We will develop training modules and supporting materials for an intervention including patient-centered care, motivational interviewing, peer support, and adherence messaging adapted to the specific findings of our qualitative study. The proposed research is consistent with and responds to priorities set by the NIH Office of AIDS Research on reducing HIV-related disparities and improving disease outcomes for HIV-infected individuals, and is also consistent with the recommendation set forth in the 2011 Institute of Medicine report on The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People to implement a research agenda designed to advance knowledge and understanding of LGBT health. Findings from this formative R34 study will provide data on the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, safety, and preliminary effect sizes or an R01 proposal to test this intervention and its components in a fully powered RCT including a larger, more diverse sample of MSM from multiple sites in sub-Saharan Africa.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up has greatly reduced morbidity and mortality due to HIV/AIDS, and has the potential to prevent HIV transmission by reducing plasma viral load. Men who have sex with men are at high risk for HIV in Africa, and face significant stigma and discrimination leading to health care disparities. This project aims to identify barriers and facilitators to ART adherence among Kenyan MSM, and design a targeted intervention using support from providers and peers to promote MSM's engagement in care and adherence. By involving MSM, Kenyan LGBT organizations, HIV care providers, and Ministry of Health representatives, we will ensure that the resulting intervention is feasible, acceptable, tolerable, safe, and ready to be tested for efficacy.                ",Provider and Peer Support Intervention to Improve ART Adherence among Kenyan Men,8661309,R34MH099946,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Cues ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' gay (sexual orientation) ', ' Homosexuals ', ' Infection ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Kenya ', ' Laws ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Center for AIDS Intervention Research Core Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes the renewal for 2014-2019 of the Center for AIDS Intervention Research (CAIR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin as an HIV behavioral research Center. CAIR's thematic mission is the conceptualization, conduct, and rigorous evaluation of interventions to prevent HIV infection in communities most vulnerable to the disease; the development of interventions to improve health outcomes among persons living with the disease; and the rapid dissemination of research findings to both the scientific community and public health service provides. The Center's Core structure supports the efforts of an interdisciplinary team of HIV prevention investigators, and CAIR has been highly productive and a strong regional, national, and international resource in the areas of research, training, and service to the scientific and public health communities. CAIR Investigators have made distinguished scientific contributions in the development of HIV prevention interventions for high-incidence populations in the United States, Eastern Europe, and other regions of the world; have advanced the field's scientific knowledge of how to transfer scientific advances to benefit service providers nationally and internationally; and have undertaken vigorous lines of behavioral and social science, methodological, and cost-effectiveness research applied to HIV prevention. CAIR's specific aims during the renewal period are: 1) the development of behavioral, social, and structural interventions that will lead to wide scale public health implementation of recently-emerging biomedical HIV prevention strategies; 2) establishing the effectiveness of multi-level HIV prevention interventions that combine potent behavioral, social, structural, and biomedical interventions to achieve greatest public health impact in reducing HIV incidence; 3) reducing HIV-related health disparities; and 4) serving as a resource that rapidly transforms scientific advances into sustainable public health practice. To support continued excellence in these areas, we propose a structure that brings together interdisciplinary teams and provides resources from the following Cores: Administration Core (Center strategic planning and oversight); Developmental Core (preliminary studies, internal peer review, Center conferences and professional development); Qualitative Core (qualitative and social science support); Quantitative Core (central data management, analysis, and biostatistical consultation); Intervention and Dissemination Core (intervention trial support and technology exchange initiatives); International Core (facilitating international initiatives); and Impact Science Core HIV prevention economic, modeling, and impact analyses). Center Cores synergistically interact, provide added value, and support achievement of CAIR's research aims.             PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: With a wide array of new prevention strategies now available, the field is at a pivotal point where, for the first time, it is possible to envision how to end th HIV epidemic. During its Center renewal period, CAIR's research will emphasize integrated prevention approaches that combine the most potent behavioral, social, structural, and biomedical modalities to achieve high public health impact by reducing HIV incidence within communities most affected by the disease.",Center for AIDS Intervention Research Core Support,8542068,P30MH052776,"['Achievement Attainment ', '

"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, after the emergence of antiretroviral therapy but before the potential of treatment as prevention had been established. Since its inception, CIRA has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings,contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, focused on the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment and the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive and multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized implementation science and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs that will diversify and replenish the field of HIV research. Building on recent advances in HIV science, the Center will foster and support various research programs in strategic areas with emphasis on implementation/translation research and combination, multi-level approaches. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will create a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers focused on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence and New Haven, This unique initiative will complement ongoing efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the 12 largest metropolitan areas by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to smaller cities with high HIV prevalence. Our global research will also focus on advancing implementation science and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, particularly South Africa, Russia and China. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five Cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods, In keeping with our strategic foci, each Core will have a role in supporting implementation science and building capacity to conduct research in small urban centers with high HIV prevalence. Addressing law, policy and ethics issues related to the conduct of HIV research will also be integral to the work of CIRA and its Cores in the new project period. Core level and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation.        RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Advances in HIV science hold great promise yet there are formidable barriers to translating this knowledge into practice. HIV disparities, a,resurgence of HIV in young MSM, the rise of HIV co-morbid conditions, the  aging ofthe HIV population, and need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public  health. CIRA is poised to address these challenges, providing a nexus for scientific inquiry and research  collaborations to advance implementation of effective solutions to the epidemic.",Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS,8690967,P30MH062294,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Aging ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Community Developments ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Goals ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Laws ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Russian SFSR ', ' Russian S.F.S.R.

"Prevention of HIV Infection in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Risk for HIV infection in the United States falls along sharp lines of disparity related to sexual orientation and race/ethnicity. HIV infection has always taken a heavy toll on men who have sex with men (MSM) and also on African Americans. However, HIV incidence disparity is most striking of all for MSM who are also African American, a segment that probably accounts for less than one percent of the American population but fully 25% of all new HIV infections in the United States. Surprisingly, very few HIV prevention interventions designed for African American MSM have been undertaken, and most existing approaches have relied on individual or small-group risk reduction counseling. These existing models have limited cultural and practical suitability for reaching high-risk African American MSM who are hidden in the community and unlikely to seek out sexual risk reduction counseling. Interventions directed to individuals alone also do not attend sufficiently to the important influence played by social norms and social network factors on risk behavior. In contrast to individual counseling models, HIV prevention interventions that are directed to social networks of Black MSM in the community and that work through natural influence channels within these networks hold the potential for reaching deeply into hidden and vulnerable populations of African American MSM. Network-level HIV prevention interventions rely on oral communication traditions and cultural models appropriate in minority communities, and can strengthen social network normative support for risk reduction. Following a 1-year formative research phase that will provide data needed to contextualize the study's recruitment, assessment, and intervention content and delivery methods, we will undertake a social network-level intervention outcome trial in 3 cities: Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Miami. Project-wide, 24 sociocentric networks of African American MSM-each expected to be composed of approximately 40 people (total n=960 participants)-will be recruited. 12 of the networks (n=480 participants) will be randomized to a comparison condition and receive HIV/STD testing, treatment, and individual counseling. The other 12 networks (n=480) will receive the same counseling and testing and also a social network intervention that identifies, trains, and engages empirically-identified influence leaders of each network to deliver ongoing, theory-based, and culturally tailored HIV prevention advice, recommendations, and support to other network members. The study will determine the comparative effectiveness of the social network intervention to the counseling, testing, and treatment comparison condition on measures of sexual risk, substance use associated with sexual risk behavior, and STD/HIV incidence assessed with laboratory measures at 6- and 18-month followup points. The study aim is to develop and determine the efficacy of an intervention modality capable of reaching and preventing HIV among high-risk African American MSM in the community.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 56,000 Americans continue to contract HIV each year, and African American MSM account for a far disproportionate number of incident infections. Public health efforts to reduce HIV incidence in the United States require the development of new prevention approaches delivered using modalities that can target and reach those population segments at greatest vulnerability. If successful, this research will identify an HIV prevention intervention approach, practical for public health service providers, that lends itself well to rapid uptake and use by CBOs, health departments, and minority organizations concerned about AIDS.

"Pilot Intervention for Discrimination and Mistrust Among HIV Positive Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (MSM) bear the greatest burden of HIV across all races/ethnicities and risk groups, accounting for ~40% of diagnoses among MSM of all races/ethnicities, and one-third among all men. Compared to other races/ethnicities, Blacks living with HIV are less likely to be diagnosed, to be engaged in care, and to receive and adhere to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Black MSM in particular show very low ART adherence. In this 3-year intervention development study, we propose to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant intervention to reduce medical mistrust and address discrimination among Black MSM living with HIV. Our work with Black MSM suggests that culturally relevant factors such as perceived discrimination and HIV- related medical mistrust (e.g., HIV ""conspiracy beliefs,"" like ""HIV is a manmade virus"") contribute to disparities in HIV treatment behaviors, in some cases even more than factors known to be highly influential like depression and substance use. Black MSM living with HIV are at the nexus of 3 stigmatized social categories (HIV-serostatus, race, sexual orientation) from which they face discrimination, which in turn can lead to disparities by increasing detrimental stress responses related to poor self-control (maladaptive coping, poor health behaviors). Discrimination also fosters mistrust of public health entities, and suspicion of medical treatments. However, no interventions have been developed to overcome these culturally relevant barriers. In the proposed innovative community-based participatory research project, we will partner with a Black-MSM- serving AIDS service organization (ASO) with high success in engaging Black MSM in research. In Phase 1, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 Black MSM and 20 social service and mental health providers, and engage stakeholders in a community advisory process to obtain input on sustainable intervention components that can improve the effectiveness of service delivery. In Phase 2, we will conduct a process evaluation of one pilot intervention group of 10 participants, delivered via a community HIV support group. In Phase 3, we will conduct a small randomized pilot trial with 3 intervention groups and 3 control groups (10 participants each). The specific aims are to: 1. Conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with Black MSM, and engage AIDS service organization (ASO) staff and mental health counselors, in order to develop intervention modules that address mistrust and discrimination among Black MSM. 2. Examine whether the pilot intervention can reduce mistrust and improve coping responses to discrimination among Black MSM. 3. Explore pilot intervention effects on mental health, antiretroviral treatment adherence, and engagement in care among Black MSM. Our goal is for the proposed culturally relevant intervention to be exportable to interventions already developed for improving adherence and engagement in care among people living with HIV. If shown to be effective in future R01-funded research, our intervention will be flexible for use in community settings, such as in existing HIV support groups already being sustained throughout the US.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-positive Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and Black MSM living with HIV have very low levels of treatment adherence and poor survival times compared to other groups. We propose to develop and pilot test a culturally relevant intervention for HIV-positive Black MSM to address mistrust and improve coping responses to discrimination - two factors that are related to poor health and health behavior in this population.

Linkages for Black HIV+, Substance Using MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic in the United States most severely affects men who have sex with men (MSM): 57% of all new infections occur in this population. Black MSM bear a disproportionate burden, with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV testing less frequently than other MSM; are less likely to be aware that they are HIV infected; are more likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care; and are less likely to be prescribed ART when eligible. These disparities are pronounced in substance using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis and delayed engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM behavior and high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this population, even as the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches 50%. Reducing HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS Strategy priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the US. Setting: The study will seek and recruit substance-using Black MSM in New York City for HIV testing and will link and retain those who are HIV-infected in HIV primary care. Study Aims: In response to the urgent public health need to seek substance-using Black MSM, identify those with HIV infection, and link the latter to HIV services, the study aims are as follows: Seek and Test: Respondent driven sampling (RDS) will be used to recruit substance-using Black MSM for HIV testing. RDS has been used in HIV surveillance among hard-to-reach populations and, to a limited extent, as a strategy for engaging hard-to-reach populations in services. We will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS to seek, recruit, and offer HIV testing to this high-risk population. Link and Retain: Participants with reactive rapid HIV test results and who are not currently in care will be randomized to two linkage and retention strategies: patient navigation (PN) and financial incentives (FI). One hundred participants will be randomized into each arm of the study. The primary objectives are: 1) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS for seeking and recruiting substance-using Black MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition for rapid HIV counseling and testing; 2) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using two interventions, PN and FI, for linkage and retention in HIV care; and 3) to assess the cost-effectiveness of PN and FI for linkage and retention in HIV care. This study has the potential to identify effective methods to seek and test substance-using Black MSM, to link the HIV infected to services, and to retain them in care and treatment. The success of such an effort responds to priorities with the national HIV strategy. Results will inform innovative approaches to engaging highest-risk, difficult-to-reach individuals in HIV counseling and testing and retaining them in care and treatment.        The proposed project will test the feasibility of an innovative method to recruit substance-using African-American men who have sex with men into counseling and testing for HIV, and for those who are found to be HIV-infected, into one of two interventions to facilitate retention in HIV care. These two interventions are: peer navigation and financial incentives. This project has the potential to increase timely diagnosis of HIV and retention in HIV primary care among populations disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US, and most burdened by multiple barriers to appropriate care.

"Sexual Networks, Drugs, and HIV Risk among Men Who Have Sex With Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K01 award will provide Dr. Hong Van Tieu with the necessary training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in HIV epidemiology and prevention. Her short-term goals are to expand her experience in HIV epidemiology and prevention research among men who have sex with men (MSM), gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics, social network analysis, and qualitative research, and further the understanding of the influence of sexual networks on HIV and sexual risk behaviors among Black and White MSM. She will receive specialized training in the epidemiology of substance use and its relationship to HIV risk among MSM. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team has expertise in HIV and substance use epidemiology, prevention, and clinical research and strong track records of supporting junior faculty to become independently funded investigators. The New York Blood Center has a long history of conducting HIV epidemiology and behavioral and biomedical prevention research among MSM and is profoundly committed to the success of this K01 award. The dramatically disproportionate HIV infection rates among Black MSM in the U.S remain unexplained by differences in individual behavioral risk. One hypothesis is that the characteristics of sexual networks of Black MSM place them at increased risk of HIV compared to non-Black MSM. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM and to examine the relationship of their network characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors using an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The proposed research will enroll a large sample of Black and White MSM (n=878) in New York City as a substudy of an NIH R01-funded study to evaluate the hypothesis that certain structural (e.g., network size, density, partner concurrency) and compositional (e.g., assortative and disassortative mixing, durability of relationships) characteristics of Black MSM sexual networks increase the men's risk of HIV infection. The specific aims of this study are the following: (1) to describe and compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, (2) to compare the association of structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks with HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, and determine whether differences in sexual network characteristics explain the disparity in HIV prevalence between Black and White MSM, and (3) to explore in depth the contexts and meanings of sexual partnerships and networks by evaluating how Black and White MSM subjectively experience their sexual networks and perceive them to influence their sexual risk behaviors using qualitative research methods. A focus of the research is on drug and alcohol use within sexual networks and their relationship to HIV risk among MSM. This research will provide critically important information on the sexual networks of Black MSM to explain the alarming rates of HIV infection among this population and to inform development and testing of sexual network-based intervention strategies to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission risk. It will also serve as an excellent platform for the candidate to gain essential training in HIV epidemiology and prevention research and generate innovative ideas for her first R01 grant application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the structure and make-up of sexual networks (connections between sexual partners) among Black and White men who have sex with men in New York City and assess the relationship of these characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors. This study will have direct impact on the design of programs to reduce HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men.           Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the structure and make-up of sexual networks (connections between sexual partners) among Black and White men who have sex with men in New York City and assess the relationship of these characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors.

"Sexual Networks and HIV Transmission Clusters among Substance Using MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Heather A. Pines with the training and experience needed to facilitate her transition toward research independence in HIV prevention science. Dr. Pines' career development plan is designed to augment her training in epidemiology and allow her to: 1) develop expertise in social network analysis, 2) acquire skills in the use of genetic sequence analysis methods to identify HIV transmission clusters (i.e., individuals with genetically related HIV infections), 3) obtain further training in the ethical conduct of research, and 4) build the sklls necessary for a successful academic career. These training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, hands-on research, and mentoring from an interdisciplinary team of experts. Global disparities in resource allocation to HIV prevention services may limit the promise of recent breakthroughs in HIV prevention science, particularly among vulnerable substance using populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Innovative research that integrates social network and genetic sequence analysis methods to direct the delivery of biomedical HIV prevention strategies to individuals at greatest risk may help maximize their impact, control costs, and facilitate their implementation in the context of limited prevention resources. To this end, the overall objective of Dr. Pines' research project is to inform the development of comprehensive HIV prevention programs that leverage information on sexual network characteristics to interrupt HIV transmission among MSM in LMIC. The project will be embedded in a NIDA study among MSM in Tijuana, Mexico (R01DA037811; PI: Patterson), to capitalize on its research infrastructure and the expertise of its bi-national collaborators, and provide Dr. Pines with the opportunity to apply her newly acquired skills in social network and genetic sequence analysis. Pilot data suggest elevated rates of substance use and associated sexual risk behaviors may be driving the HIV epidemic among MSM in Tijuana. Thus, understanding the impact of substance use on sexual network characteristics and HIV transmission dynamics among MSM will be a major focus of this research. Specifically, the project aims to: 1) examine the influence of mean degree (number of male anal intercourse partners), the degree distribution, and sexual mixing patterns on overall sexual network structure among MSM; 2) identify individual, sexual network compositional, and socio-contextual factors associated with degree; and 3) determine whether sexual mixing patterns are associated with HIV transmission cluster membership. Findings from this project will be critical to Dr. Pines' development of an R01 proposal that integrates epidemiologic, social network, and genetic sequence analysis methods to advance HIV prevention science. These training and research activities will position Dr. Pines as the only researcher in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego with this unique skill set and enable her to develop an independent research career.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in HIV prevention science could significantly reduce HIV incidence worldwide.1 However, their promise may be limited among men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where HIV prevention resources for MSM populations are limited.2 The proposed training and research activities will enable the candidate to apply interdisciplinary research methods to investigate MSM sexual networks in Tijuana, Mexico in order to direct the delivery of scarce prevention

"Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the happy consequences of HAART is that HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals now have available to them medications that allow them to reach old age. This means that we have the previously unexpected challenge of finding ways to support healthy aging in communities with high HIV prevalence rates. This challenge is likely to be particularly difficult among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to not only their very high background HIV prevalence rates but also the general dearth of proven models to promote healthy aging among older MSM. To meet this challenge, we need to develop health promotion programs that are more potent than the efficacious but time-limited effects found among HIV prevention interventions. Thus, we need to identify mechanisms to raise levels of intervention efficacy to support healthy aging beyond those that have already been tapped to support other health promotion efforts among MSM. In previous research by our group, we documented that specific resiliencies among MSM appear to have robust health-promoting properties. Resiliencies research conducted among aging MSM is an innovative agenda on several counts. The dominant approach to explaining patterns of health among MSM has been to study the effects of deficits in creating health disparities. While an emphasis on deficits is useful in explaining the life course trajectories of men who have multiple psychosocial health problems that result in poor health outcomes, this focus is less helpful in explaining the trajectories of te far larger proportion of MSM who have also experienced cultural marginalization and yet remain healthy well into later life. This application proposes the following aims to test a theory-based approach to identifying both deficits and resiliencies among aging MSM over six waves of data collection (N=1850) using an ongoing cohort study.1)To measure changes in prevalence rates of psychosocial health problems and resiliencies over time; 2)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with changes in substance use and other psychosocial health problems and to test whether resiliencies moderate the pathway to syndemics; and 3)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with better HIV-related outcomes and biomarkers among HIV-positive MSM and to test if resiliencies moderate the impact of syndemics on these same outcomes. By identifying the resiliencies already used by some aging MSM to stay healthy but which have yet to be incorporated in current health promotion efforts for MSM, we can progress to the testing of potentially efficacious health promotion programs to support healthy aging among MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although many older men who have sex with men (MSM) exhibit significant strengths that have helped them remain healthy well into later life, these strategies have not been well documented. In particular, the strengths, or resiliencies, of older MSM have not been carefully studied in terms of their ability to support health as men age. This study will use a theory-based approach to follow aging MSM in six waves of an ongoing cohort study to document how resiliencies moderate the effects of health risks to better explain patterns of health and illness among aging MSM.            ",Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men,8975265,R01MD010680,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' partner violence ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia  ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,603412,0.08162792676186323

"Web-facilitated intervention for heavy drinking and HIV risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Annual rates of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States continue to grow rapidly, despite stability or decline among other groups. This trend highlights the ongoing importance of developing new tools to fight the continued expansion of the HIV epidemic among MSM. Although a number of sex risk reduction interventions exist for MSM, important limitations have restricted their impact. These include barriers to dissemination and/or implementation, such as lengthy treatment protocols, the need for highly- trained interventionists, and confining delivery only to healthcare settings. Interventions have also failed to address pivotal factors that lead to high-risk behavior specifically heavy drinking. Research testing the efficacy of interventions to reduce heavy drinking among MSM is scarce, and has mostly only explored lengthier treatment protocols that span several weeks or months. Single-exposure intervention approaches for reducing heavy drinking based on the principles of motivational interviewing (MI), commonly referred to as ""Personalized Feedback Interventions,"" have been developed and tested in other populations with success. Similar brief interventions for HIV-risk reduction based on stages of change and MI-principles, such as Personalized Cognitive Counseling, have also been shown to produce meaningful reductions in unprotected sex among these individuals. These parallel lines of research highlight the opportunity for developing a brief, combined intervention for reducing both alcohol use and sex risk among MSM. Adapting and delivering these interventions via a technology-based or mHealth format would also begin to allow the extension of interventions beyond the traditional interactions and settings, potentially improving efficacy, flexibility, and scalability. As such, the proposed research will serve as the foundation for a research program focusing on developing technology-assisted tools that can be easily delivered to high-risk individuals. This three-year project aims to develop and pilot test a brief, combined intervention for reducing heavy drinking and unprotected sex among MSM based on principles of MI. This combined intervention will be adapted to a tablet- based format and developed specifically for use with high-risk MSM in community-based settings. The research involves two phases: Phase 1 involves conducting qualitative research to (1) integrate alcohol use and sex risk intervention components, (2) adapt them to a technology-based format, and (3) understand and address challenges in implementation, feasibility, and acceptability. Phase 2 entails conducting a randomized- controlled pilot test of the intervention among MSM seeking HIV testing in community-based settings to explore its potential impact on alcohol and HIV-related behavioral outcomes. This research will ultimately produce a combined, theory-based, and technology-delivered intervention for heavy drinking and sex risk that is fully portable and has been preliminarily tested for efficacy in community settings where high-risk MSM engage with prevention services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to develop a tablet-based intervention based on principles of motivational interviewing for use in community settings to help high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM) reduce heavy drinking and sex risks. These tools will help MSM at high-risk for HIV acquisition to evaluate their current behavior, consider options for change, and develop a plan for reducing harm. The research will thus provide prevention personnel with an evidence-based, low-cost, high-fidelity tool for reducing risk among high-risk MSM that present for voluntary HIV testing and counseling.

"Community Engagement to Enhance EBI Implementation in a Public Housing Community ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For HIV prevention efforts to be most effective they must reach populations most at risk, use efficacious interventions, and be deliverable in real-world settings. While many efficacious evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for HIV prevention currently exist, community-based organizations (CBOs) often have difficulties implementing them among those most likely to benefit, with fidelity, good effect, and sustainability. Structural factors related to poverty often hinder HIV prevention delivery in communities most in need of the programs. For CBOs to successfully prevent the transmission of HIV in high risk communities, strategies to overcome the challenges of implementation are needed. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) offers one approach to work with community members to pinpoint community resources, priorities, needs, and barriers to consider in implementation. This application explores these issues among an often under-recognized group at enormously increased risk of HIV: African American women in the US South. The South is disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, with incidence rising over the last decade, and the largest burden on African Americans and women. HIV burden in women has also grown the past 25 years from 8% to over 25% of US AIDS cases. While African American women are only 12% of US women, they comprise 64% of newly infected women. Compounding the great need represented by these disparities, in previous studies, African American women in North Carolina reported significant structural obstacles to accessing HIV prevention programs in their communities, such as lack of transportation and childcare, food insecurity, and competing demands and suggested that program delivery in or near public housing facilities may represent a feasible way to overcome some of these barriers in locations where many people at elevated risk of HIV are concentrated. In a unique, transdisciplinary collaboration between UNC, CAARE, and the Durham Housing Authority, the central objective of this application is to design a structurally-informed implementation program plan for sustainable HIV prevention in public housing developments, using the Real AIDS Prevention Program EBI for African American women, as a test-case model in three aims. We will 1) Engage a broad range of community stakeholders to participate in the design of study methods and adaptation of RAPP for women living in public housing developments in the southern US through CBPR methods; 2) Understand perceived community resources, needs, priorities, and obstacles to the implementation of HIV prevention programs, particularly RAPP, among DHA residents and DHA and CAARE staff; 3) Create a replicable program plan for implementing RAPP within southern housing authority developments and pilot-test the implementation plan within the DHA for fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability.If successful, our next step will be to test the implementation program plan more widely at multiple southern US sites in an R01 application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to identify effective methods for implementing evidence-based HIV prevention programs for African American women in real-world settings in the rural south. It represents a partnership between community based organizations and the academic center to use community-based participatory research approaches. The proposed project is highly relevant to public health because it will help further understanding of how to implement high-quality evidence-based HIV prevention interventions in vulnerable communities.                ",Community Engagement to Enhance EBI Implementation in a Public Housing Community,8921665,R34MH104081,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' North Carolina ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Housing ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' authority ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R34,2015,228760,0.05364277699838051
"Effects of Individual and Structural-Level Factors on Sex Risk and STI in High-Risk MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In addition to being the subgroup with the highest HIV incidence, men who have sex with men (MSM) are also disproportionately affected by other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which make it more likely for HIV transmission to occur. For example, in 2012, MSM accounted for three-quarters of all primary and secondary syphilis infections11. Additionally, MSM were found to be more likely to be infected with strains of gonorrhea which are resistant to antibiotic drugs20,29. Evidence further suggests that a racial disparity within the MSM community may exist where Blacks and Hispanics have shown a steeper increase in STI infection relative to their non-Hispanic white counterparts 53. In addition to being disproportionately affected by STIs, recent empirical work has also suggested that nearly one-in-three MSM has experienced childhood sexual abuse (CSA)37. CSA has been associated with increased use of avoidance coping50 and substance use37,41 in order to remedy negative affect. It has also been linked to increased PTSD symptom expression38. Each of these individual-level psychological variables is thought to be a determinant to STI infection as they've been linked to STI acquisition and transmission16,52,44. However, these psychological factors alone fail to account for the ways in which systemic social factors may play a role in disproportionate rates of STI infection 12. Structural factors such as poverty, unstable housing, and neighborhood crime have also been linked to increased sexual risk3, 15, 30, 35.These social determinants have also been associated with STI infection 1, 6, 35. The current proposal seeks to investigate both psychological (avoidance coping, substance use, and PTSD symptomology) and social (poverty, unstable housing, and neighborhood crime) determinants and relate them to sexual risk and STI infection both cross-sectionally and longitudinally among high-risk MSM with histories of CSA. The proposal seeks to model baseline interrelationships between psychological/social determinants and sexual risk (Aim 1) and self-reported STI infection in the past year (Aim 2). We will evaluate the effects of racial identity on these relationships. It then seeks to longitudinally examine the impact of psychological and social determinants on the trajectory of sexual risk over 12 months (Aim 3). Lastly, the proposal will employ a prospective longitudinal design to examine how psychological/social determinants affect likelihood of acquiring an STI over the course of 12 months (Aim 4). Findings from this study may better inform us of relative risk associated with psychological and social determinants. This can be used to design structural interventions aimed at reducing the disparity in STI incidence for MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ameliorating the ethnic/racial disparity that exists in sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among men who have sex with men (MSM) is a critical public health concern as untreated STIs facilitate HIV transmission. Understanding the relationship between both individual-level and structural factors and sexual risk behavior/STI acquisition is an important benchmark in the realization of this goal as structural factors have been understudied. Structural factors must be studied with individual factors to ascertain the relative degree of risk associated with each in an effort to inform innovative structural interventions designed to reduce STI transmission in at-risk populations of MSM.            ",Effects of Individual and Structural-Level Factors on Sex Risk and STI in High-Risk MSM,8924530,F31MH107315,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Molestation, Sexual, Child ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Crime ', ' Cross Infection ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Investigation ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' psychosocial ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Low income ', ' Symptoms ', ' Psychological Impact ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' resistance strain ', ' resistant strain ', ' distress tolerance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,F31,2015,43120,0.07747644771001976
"Understanding disparities in effective HIV treatment and prevention: Involvement+ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MSM are a key risk group in the United States and are disproportionately impacted in terms of HIV prevalence and incidence. For decades, black/white disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence have been recognized. Much of the dialogue about disparities has focused on what might cause disparities in new HIV infections, and we recently completed an NIMH-supported R01 (InvolveMENt) to examine reasons for black/white HIV disparities in an HIV/STI incidence cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta. An early, important finding from that study is that HIV-negative black MSM, while having comparable levels of individual risk behaviors, have a much greater chance of having a sex partner with a detectable HIV viral load - thus black MSM are at higher risk for acquiring HIV, despite comparable individual risk behaviors. But disparities extend beyond risks for infection: black MSM may fare less well in the treatment cascade because of later access to care, lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ARV), mistrust of providers, or, perhaps, stigma and discrimination. Recent national estimates have documented consistent racial disparities at each step of the HIV treatment cascade, culminating in a 30% lower likelihood of viral suppression among black non-Hispanic, compared to white non- Hispanic HIV-positive individuals. This pattern has been observed in the state of Georgia. In a Lancet systematic review in 2012, Millet et al. illustrated that the racial disparities after HIV infection are profound for MSM: black MSM were found to be less likely to initiate ARVT, less likely to adhere to therapy, and less likely to be virally suppressed. Further, this analysis suggested that structural factors, such as education, poverty, and lack of employment, played key roles in care disparities. Thus, we propose to build on our previous MSM cohort in Atlanta, to identify the factors that are prospectively associated with racial disparities in effective HIV care and prevention. The proposed work will build on the infrastructure, community relationships, multilevel conceptual framework and multidisciplinary team assembled for our previous grant, but will shift focus from HIV-negative MSM to those living with HIV.

"The Transnational Cohort: global HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transwomen bear a disproportionate burden of HIV worldwide, yet incidence is seldom measured and the determinants of acquiring infection are unknown. There is no HIV prevention intervention for transwomen with evidence of efficacy. Our project's goals are to create an international platform for HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen, obtain benchmarks for HIV incidence, and characterize causal factors for infection. We propose a cohort study of 1,100 transwomen in San Francisco, USA and São Paulo, Brazil where capacities are ready for longitudinal research. The cohort will measure HIV incidence and test hypotheses on HIV acquisition related to social and biomedical gender transition events and components of the Gender Affirmation, Behavioral Ecological, and Minority Stress models. Meanwhile, little is known about transwomen in China, the world's largest country, or sub- Saharan Africa, where the HIV epidemic is most severe. Basic epidemiological research on transwomen in these regions is overdue. We therefore also propose a cross-sectional survey of 250 transwomen in Nanjing, China and a formative assessment of transwomen in Windhoek, Namibia. In addition to obtaining the first estimates of HIV prevalence among transwomen in China and the first focused study of transwomen in sub-Saharan Africa, we will prepare these sites for future inclusion in the cohort. Our specific aims for the current proposal are: 1) to establish a population-based cohort of transwomen in San Francisco and São Paulo to measure HIV incidence; 2) to test hypotheses on social and biomedical gender transition events as causal factors in HIV acquisition among transwomen; 3) to initiate HIV prevention research for transwomen in China and sub-Saharan Africa. We will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS) for recruitment in order to approximate population-based samples for high external validity. Social media and mobile and web-based technologies will be used to increase cohort retention for high internal validity. HIV is only one health disparity experienced by transwomen. Transwomen are at increased risk for multiple mental health disorders and little is known about the impact of gender transition procedures on non-communicable diseases.

"Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM Project Summary/Abstract Racial/ethnic disparities in HIV have been a hallmark of the US HIV epidemic for decades, with black/African Americans experiencing higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans. These disparities are also observed in men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom the highest incidence rates are in young black/African American MSM (YBAAMSM). Despite a rich literature demonstrating the prevalent levels of drug and alcohol use among MSM and the potential relationships between these substances and high-risk sexual behaviors, individual risk behaviors do not explain why black MSM and YBAAMSM are more likely to become infected with HIV, compared to other MSM. Studies of self-reported use have collectively demonstrated no greater substance use among black MSM than among white MSM. However, a key finding of our previous R01, which examined factors associated with prevalent and incident HIV infection among a prospective cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta, was that black MSM had substantially lower validity of self-reported drug use, compared to white MSM. Biomarker-classified drug use was also more predictive of HIV seroconversions than self-reported sexual behavior measures, suggesting that, in this population, substance use may be a marker of high-risk partners and environments. Furthermore, the racial disparity in prevalent HIV infection was most associated with differences in network and community factors rather than individual factors. Despite emerging data on sexual partners and structures among YBAAMSM, little is known about the overlap of sexual and substance-use networks, though this might amplify HIV/STI transmission risk. Therefore, we propose to conduct a new prospective cohort study of 300 HIV-negative YBAAMSM in Atlanta, GA, to understand prospective patterns of biomarker-supported substance use in YBAAMSM, as well as its antecedents, contexts, and consequences. This new project will build on the strong institutional infrastructure, community partnerships, theoretical frameworks, analytical approaches, and multidisciplinary research that contributed to the success of our previous cohort study. Results will provide a more detailed understanding of the multilevel associations between substance use and HIV risk, and will yield new opportunities for combination interventions that address the syndemics of HIV/STI and drug use among YBAAMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Profound disparities in HIV incidence exist for young black/African American MSM compared to other subgroups of MSM. Substance use is prevalent and associated with HIV infection for young black/African American MSM, but the mechanisms by which substances impart added HIV risk are unclear. A cohort study of HIV-negative black MSM ages 18-29 is proposed to further understanding of the relationships between substances and HIV/STI incidence and risk behaviors, and suggest possible interventions.",Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM,8866383,R01DA038196,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Cocaine ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' marijuana ', ' Marihuana ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Community Networks ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' HIV risk ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Sentinel ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validity of Self Report ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' cocaine use ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,657646,0.048950165357782495
"RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV, interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present, only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. Our team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect, reductions in stimulant use, improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count, and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed randomized controlled trial addresses a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM). By utilizing contingency management as the platform for the delivery of an innovative positive affect intervention, this research could identify the first efficacious integrative intervention for promoting long-term reductions in HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM.

"STAR-Seek, Test and Retain. Linkages for Black HIV+, Substance Using MSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic in the United States most severely affects men who have sex with men (MSM): 57% of all new infections occur in this population. Black MSM bear a disproportionate burden, with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV testing less frequently than other MSM; are less likely to be aware that they are HIV infected; are more likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care; and are less likely to be prescribed ART when eligible. These disparities are pronounced in substance using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis and delayed engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM behavior and high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this population, even as the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches 50%. Reducing HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS Strategy priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the US. Setting: The study will seek and recruit substance-using Black MSM in New York City for HIV testing and will link and retain those who are HIV-infected in HIV primary care. Study Aims: In response to the urgent public health need to seek substance-using Black MSM, identify those with HIV infection, and link the latter to HIV services, the study aims are as follows: Seek and Test: Respondent driven sampling (RDS) will be used to recruit substance-using Black MSM for HIV testing. RDS has been used in HIV surveillance among hard-to-reach populations and, to a limited extent, as a strategy for engaging hard-to-reach populations in services. We will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS to seek, recruit, and offer HIV testing to this high-risk population. Link and Retain: Participants with reactive rapid HIV test results and who are not currently in care will be randomized to two linkage and retention strategies: patient navigation (PN) and financial incentives (FI). One hundred participants will be randomized into each arm of the study. The primary objectives are: 1) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS for seeking and recruiting substance-using Black MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition for rapid HIV counseling and testing; 2) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using two interventions, PN and FI, for linkage and retention in HIV care; and 3) to assess the cost-effectiveness of PN and FI for linkage and retention in HIV care. This study has the potential to identify effective methods to seek and test substance-using Black MSM, to link the HIV infected to services, and to retain them in care and treatment. The success of such an effort responds to priorities with the national HIV strategy. Results will inform innovative approaches to engaging highest-risk, difficult-to-reach individuals in HIV counseling and testing and retaining them in care and treatment. The proposed project will test the feasibility of an innovative method to recruit substance-using African-American men who have sex with men into counseling and testing for HIV, and for those who are found to be HIV-infected, into one of two interventions to facilitate retention in HIV care. These two interventions are: peer navigation and financial incentives. This project has the potential to increase timely diagnosis of HIV and retention in HIV primary care among populations disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US, and most burdened by multiple barriers to appropriate care.","STAR-Seek, Test and Retain.

"CBPR for Sexual Health & Reduction of HIV Health Disparities Among MSM in PR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the overall rate of new HIV infections In the U.S. has remained relatively steady since 2006, rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) have significantly increased, particularly in ethnic/racial minority MSM. Similar patterns are seen among MSM in Puerto Rico where high levels of social stigma and bias contribute to poor use of HIV screening and late engagement in HIV care, resulting in high rates of premature mortality and high levels of circulating virus-thereby fueling secondary infections and thus sustaining the epidemic. In response to the longstanding absence of evidence-based HIV interventions for MSM in PR, and using a CBPR approach, we will adapt existing Sexual Health Promotion intervention technology for use among MSM who are HIV-/status unknown/or who are HIV+ but not enrolled in HIV care monitoring/treatment. In Year 1, we will conduct an ethnographically-oriented Community Assessment Process to develop a detailed understanding of sources of alienation and delay in care among MSM and to elicit direct feedback from MSM about their services needs and priorities. A parallel elicitation will be undertaken among service providers. This elicitation process will support identification of key stakeholders from both groups who will serve on the Community Advisory Board which will guide adaptation and implementation of the intervention. In Years 2 and 3, and building on an existing ""Core"" study within a local community STI/HIV services clinic (CLETS), we will recruit 240 MSM to participate in a preliminary assessment of the impact of the intervention. Using a ""Comparative Effectiveness"" approach, we will compare conventional, 2-session pre and post-test counseling with the adapted 2-session Sexual Health Promotion intervention on key outcomes, including sexual risk reduction, frequency of UAI, understanding the role of untreated STIs in facilitating HIV transmission, awareness of the role of early initiation of ARV care in effective management of HIV disease, health-seeking skills (including improved stigma management skills), routinization of non-symptom-driven HIV screening at 6 month intervals, and rapid uptake in HIV monitoring/ARV treatment services among newly-diagnosed HIV+ MSM. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed study will use a CBPR strategy to adapt and test sexual health promotion interventions to increase MSM participation in STI/HIV testing, with the goal of accelerating detection and early enrollment in treatment.",CBPR for Sexual Health & Reduction of HIV Health Disparities Among MSM in PR,8842479,R24MD008090,"['Accounting ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Latin America ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Process Assessment ', ' Process Assessment (Health Care) ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Fostering ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Clinic ', ' secondary infection ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' treatment center ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,R24,2015,367158,0.1239804503236314
"Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This mentored research project will investigate an under-researched aspect of HIV in Africa: the HIV prevention needs of female migrants. Migration and HIV research has almost exclusively focused on HIV risks to male migrants, often failing to measure the risks to women via their involvement in migration. Yet across the region, women's levels of participation in migration have met or exceeded those of men. Moreover, the few studies which have examined HIV risks to female migrants found higher risk behavior and HIV prevalence in migrant compared to non-migrant women. My dissertation study found that migration was associated with a higher risk of HIV infection in women than in men in South Africa. The finding warrants confirmation in East Africa, where HIV/AIDS is devastating communities and the sex disparity in infection risk is striking. HIV prevalence levels in Nyanza Province, Kenya are among the highest in Africa. Previous studies have found high levels of participation in migration by both men and women in Kenya and higher sexual risk behaviors among migrants than non-migrants. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which participation in migration leads to higher risk behavior in women. My proposed plan will address this gap. It is comprised of two phases: a secondary data analysis, and an in-depth qualitative study in Kenya. These two 'modules' will address the following aims: (1) Assess the degree to which HIV infection in women in Kenya is influenced by their participation in migration, and identify explanatory mechanisms by which women's migration may increase their HIV risks. I will use secondary data from Kenya Demographic and Health and AIDS Indicator Surveys and demographic surveillance field sites to carry out analyses to achieve this aim. Using 'HIV Triangulation', I will evaluate these findings along with information from other sources in participatory workshops with local stakeholders in Kenya. This exercise will inform the design of the qualitative study to be carried out in Aim 2: (2) Characterize social and psychological aspects of women's migration experience in Nyanza Province, Kenya which facilitate their risks of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. I will use participant observation and in-depth interviews to characterize the spatial and social features of the common destinations of female migrants, and identify the structural and psychological aspects of women's migration that influence their HIV infection risks. These antecedents to HIV infection in female migrants serve as potential points of HIV prevention intervention, thus laying the groundwork for Aim 3: (3) Develop a preliminary plan for a multi-level HIV prevention intervention with female migrants in Nyanza. In participatory workshops with local stakeholders, I will critically evaluate the cumulative findings of this research, identify potential points of intervention with female migrants, assess acceptability of various options, and develop a preliminary intervention plan. At the start of year 4 I will submit an R34 application to the NIMH for a formative study to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Project Narrative  The research proposed in this application examines the overlooked role that women's  participation in migration may play in sustaining an enormous HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan  Africa. This research will be significant because it will provide the first comprehensive  investigation of the mechanisms through which migration increases HIV risk among women in  the region. A better understanding of women's patterns of migration and mechanisms through  which migration increases HIV risk is necessary both to improve our capacity to control HIV and  to respond to future emerging infectious disease threats.",Identifying Opportunities for HIV Prevention Among Female Migrants in Kenya,8785133,K01MH093205,"['Academic Training ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Survey ', ' Epidemic ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Kenya ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Internal Migrations ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Africa ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' Female Roles ', "" Women's Role "", ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' high risk behavior ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Province ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' population movement ', ' migratory population ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2015,171354,0.006168126547521307
"HOME: A Comprehensive HIV Testing and Linkage Package for Young MSM of Color DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HOME is a project whose aim is to increase rates of HIV testing among young African American and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM). Young African American and Latino MSM have higher rates of HIV infection than all other groups, are more likely not to know they are HIV infected, and less likely to get adequate HIV care. To break the cycle of HIV transmission in these populations, the HOME project will harness the power of home HIV tests, soon to be licensed for over-the-counter use. We will also use new technologies for communication, such as online videos, social networking, SMS texting, and telemedicine (live video linkage from patient to clinician) to build a support network for young men to test and get linked into care. The final project will be a clinical trial in Oaklad and San Francisco to evaluate whether the HOME package is desirable and increases HIV testing rates and/or access to services in young MSM of color. If successful, the components of HOME are developed so they can be scalable to many parts of the country. The HOME project is designed to break the cycle of HIV infection between young African American and Latino men who have sex with men.

"HIV Risk, Drug Use, Social Networks: Homeless Persons Transitioned to Housing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We utilize a social ecological model to understand longitudinal changes in HIV risk and prevention behaviors among chronically homeless, predominantly African American men and women who transition into permanent supportive housing (PSH). Homeless persons face disproportionate risk of HIV and drug use. PSH is intended as the locus of integrated health services for this vulnerable population, yet there has been almost no research to understand HIV risk and prevention among residents, or the provision of HIV prevention services within PSH, except specifically for people living with HIV/AIDS. Some evidence suggests that transitioning to housing could increase rather than decrease risk behaviors over time, although research to clarify these complexities is absent.  Specific Aims are as follows: 1) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 2) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with changes in social networks of PSH residents, and how networks are associated with changes in HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 3) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with changes in drug use and mental health symptoms among PSH residents, and how changes in these individual characteristics are associated with HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 4) To determine whether and how PSH providers promote HIV prevention, and to understand policies and procedures that may impact HIV risk among residents; 5) To synthesize findings from Aims 1- 4 to inform specific strategies to reduce risk of HIV transmission and to enhance HIV prevention services for residents in PSH.  Aims 1-3 will be addressed through structured interviews (baseline, 3, 6, 12 months) with consecutive admissions to PSH (N=405 at 12 months). Aim 4 will be addressed through individual interviews with supervisory staff (N=30) and focus groups with front line staff (N=100) of PSH programs, and ethnographic shadowing of PSH residents (N=30). Aim 5 will synthesize findings of Aims 1-4 through focus groups with 50 PSH providers and 50 residents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The planned study is relevant to the public health because of its focus on understanding and reducing HIV risk in a highly vulnerable population: chronically homeless, predominantly African American individuals. The U.S. is investing in housing and supportive health services for chronically homeless persons yet faces a knowledge gap in the delivery of HIV prevention services to this population.","HIV Risk, Drug Use, Social Networks: Homeless Persons Transitioned to Housing",8813551,R01DA036345,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Homeless persons ', ' Housing ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' Shadowing ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Social Network ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' sexually active ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' transitionally housed ', ' transitional housing ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' supportive housing ', ' supported housing ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,714184,-0.019691306227088572
"Provider and Peer Support Intervention to Improve ART Adherence among Kenyan Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although men who have sex with men (MSM) are at very high risk for HIV globally, this group has only recently become an important focus of national HIV/AIDS programs in sub-Saharan Africa. While it is clear that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and prevent sexual transmission from HIV-infected MSM, little is known about antiretroviral adherence and barriers to care among African MSM. We have worked with MSM involved in sex work on the Kenyan coast since 2005, and have found significant disparities in HIV treatment engagement, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes in this group, due at least in part to stigma and social isolation. Involving bot providers and peers in an intervention to support MSM as they initiate ART, combined with regular messaging to promote adherence, is an innovative strategy to address this treatment gap. In this R34 application, prepared in response to PAR-11-278 ""Discovery, Development, and Testing of Novel Interventions to Advance HIV Prevention and Care,"" we propose a 3-year developmental project to design and pilot test a culturally appropriate and generalizable antiretroviral adherence intervention for African MSM. The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration among experienced investigators at the University of Washington, Kenya Medical Research Institute, University of Oxford, and Brown University, based on a foundation of 7 years' experience conducting research with Kenyan MSM that underpins the significance and innovation of this proposal. Our specific aims are to: (1) conduct qualitative research including in-depth interviews and focus groups with HIV-1-seropositive MSM, treatment-experienced peers, and their providers to identify common barriers and likely facilitators of ART adherence; (2) design and field test a theoretically driven intervention for MSM combining provider and peer support to encourage engagement in care, build trust, and deliver regular adherence messaging; and (3) implement a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the resulting multi-component intervention versus standard care with 60 MSM participants. We will develop training modules and supporting materials for an intervention including patient-centered care, motivational interviewing, peer support, and adherence messaging adapted to the specific findings of our qualitative study. The proposed research is consistent with and responds to priorities set by the NIH Office of AIDS Research on reducing HIV-related disparities and improving disease outcomes for HIV-infected individuals, and is also consistent with the recommendation set forth in the 2011 Institute of Medicine report on The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People to implement a research agenda designed to advance knowledge and understanding of LGBT health. Findings from this formative R34 study will provide data on the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, safety, and preliminary effect sizes or an R01 proposal to test this intervention and its components in a fully powered RCT including a larger, more diverse sample of MSM from multiple sites in sub-Saharan Africa. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up has greatly reduced morbidity and mortality due to HIV/AIDS, and has the potential to prevent HIV transmission by reducing plasma viral load. Men who have sex with men are at high risk for HIV in Africa, and face significant stigma and discrimination leading to health care disparities. This project aims to identify barriers and facilitators to ART adherence among Kenyan MSM, and design a targeted intervention using support from providers and peers to promote MSM's engagement in care and adherence. By involving MSM, Kenyan LGBT organizations, HIV care providers, and Ministry of Health representatives, we will ensure that the resulting intervention is feasible, acceptable, tolerable, safe, and ready to be tested for efficacy.",Provider and Peer Support Intervention to Improve ART Adherence among Kenyan Men,8838259,R34MH099946,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Cues ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' gay (sexual orientation) ', ' Homosexuals ', ' Infection ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Kenya ', ' Laws ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Addressing Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Current and Future Epidemics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related deaths now exceed HIV-related deaths in the US. Throughout the world, HCV is hyperendemic in people who inject drugs (PWID). New outbreaks of acute HCV infection are unfolding in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) and in 15-24 year olds who have transitioned from abuse of prescription opioids to illicit opiate injection. In patients with chronic HCV infection, 20-25% wil develop liver disease which may manifest as cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognosis for HCC is extremely poor, and HCV is the chief etiologic agent for this type of cancer. Recent discoveries in HCV prevention and treatment provide a great opportunity to reverse the trend toward increasing rates of HCV, HCV/HIV co-infection, and HCC. This study will use the methods of Implementation Science - research synthesis, mathematical modeling and simulation, and comparative effectiveness analyses - to determine how best to constitute a portfolio of interventions for the prevention and control of HCV and its consequences while taking into limited resources and underlying epidemiologic and social network features account. A dissemination plan will make extensive use of technology, including social media, and guidance from key stakeholders. These are our specific aims: 1. Synthesize evidence characterizing a) transition from misuse of prescription opioids to drug injection, b) HCV epidemiology and prevention for PWID and HIV+ MSM, and c) progression and treatment of HCV disease in these two groups, to derive best estimates to populate our HCV natural history and transmission models. 2. Use agent-based modeling to estimate the effects of scale-up of individual and combined prevention- and treatment-related interventions on HCV transmission and natural history in PWID and HIV+MSM. 3. Determine the combination of interventions for particular budget and epidemiologic scenarios that a) minimizes acute and chronic HCV infections, including HIV/HCV co-infection, b) prevents the greatest number of cases of HCV-related HCC and other serious sequelae, c) maximizes life expectancy and quality- adjusted life expectancy and d) reduces health disparities. 4. In collaboration with our Dissemination Advisory Board, apply an integrated knowledge-exchange approach to providing our target audiences (policymakers, public health and harm reduction practice communities, PWID and HIV+MSM) with the knowledge and tools to implement evidence-based HCV control strategies or reduce personal risk of infection and its consequences. The broad objective of this study is to provide an evidence base to guide allocation of scarce public resources in the US and other countries where HCV is principally transmitted among PWID. This will be accomplished by synthesizing, modeling and translating very recent developments in HCV epidemiology, prevention and treatment into practical tools to optimize population health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Statement The goal of this study is to help decision makers improve population health by providing guidance on the most effective set of interventions to control hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in people who inject drugs and HIV- positive men who have sex with men. In the US, HCV is the main causal factor in hepatocellular carcinoma which has a very poor prognosis, and HCV-related deaths now exceed deaths related to HIV. This research will synthesize evidence as to the effectiveness of different intervention strategies in terms of both individual benefit (preventing HCV infections in these populations, reducing HCC and other consequences of HCV), and in terms of societal benefit (reducing health care costs and impact on life expectancy).",Addressing Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Current and Future

"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, after the emergence of antiretroviral therapy but before the potential of treatment as prevention had been established. Since its inception, CIRA has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings,contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, focused on the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment and the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive and multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized implementation science and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs that will diversify and replenish the field of HIV research. Building on recent advances in HIV science, the Center will foster and support various research programs in strategic areas with emphasis on implementation/translation research and combination, multi-level approaches. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will create a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers focused on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence and New Haven, This unique initiative will complement ongoing efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the 12 largest metropolitan areas by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to smaller cities with high HIV prevalence. Our global research will also focus on advancing implementation science and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, particularly South Africa, Russia and China. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five Cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods, In keeping with our strategic foci, each Core will have a role in supporting implementation science and building capacity to conduct research in small urban centers with high HIV prevalence. Addressing law, policy and ethics issues related to the conduct of HIV research will also be integral to the work of CIRA and its Cores in the new project period. Core level and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation.        RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Advances in HIV science hold great promise yet there are formidable barriers to translating this knowledge into practice. HIV disparities, a,resurgence of HIV in young MSM, the rise of HIV co-morbid conditions, the  aging ofthe HIV population, and need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public  health.

"Using Phylogenetics to Elucidate HIV Transmission Patterns and Inform Prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a K08 award for Ann Dennis MD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, who is training to become an independent investigator in HIV transmission, epidemiology, and prevention. Despite marked advances in HIV treatment and prevention, new HIV diagnoses continue in the southeastern US where significant disparities still exist among racial minorities and men who have sex with men. Innovative methods are needed to successfully decrease incident HIV infections among these vulnerable groups. The identification of phylogenetic HIV transmission networks or ""clusters"", which are highly related sequences from individuals with shared HIV transmission, offers unique insight into the structure of HIV transmission on a population level that cannot be obtained through contact tracing or other patient-reported history. Paired with clinical and demographic data, these transmission clusters may provide new targets to direct HIV prevention efforts for groups at highest risk for ongoing transmission. The overall research objective is to characterize local phylogenetic clusters in North Carolina and investigate the use of phylogeny in the public health setting to target future interventions. The proposed study will employ innovative methods in molecular epidemiology to reconstruct transmission clusters using large repositories of HIV pol sequences extracted from antiretroviral resistance testing sent during routine clinical care. The aims of the study are to: ) Identify the temporal and clinical features of emerging or expanding HIV transmission clusters in a large clinical cohort of new and established HIV cases; 2) Assess the effect of higher density sampling of prevalent HIV cases on the detection of transmission clusters and characterize the statewide epidemic structure; and 3) Determine feasibility of incorporating HIV sequence analysis into routine HIV surveillance in a circumscribed geographic area. Dr. Dennis's mentoring team will consist of primary mentor Joseph Eron, MD, Professor of Medicine at UNC with over 20 years of experience in HIV clinical and epidemiologic research. Two co-mentors will offer complementary areas of expertise in HIV epidemiology and phylogenetics: William Miller, MD, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine at UNC whose research focuses on HIV epidemiology; and Stephane Hue, PhD, virologist at University College London, an internationally recognized expert in HIV phylogenetics and UNC collaborator since 2010. Dr. Dennis' training plan links to the proposed research aims: establish a solid foundation in HIV epidemiology including surveillance and outbreak investigation; expand skills in phylogenetic analyses integrating time- scaled and geographic data; and explore ethical issues surrounding phylogenetics in HIV prevention. Training will be accomplished through a combination of didactic courses, workshops, and practicums. These training and research activities will allow Dr. Dennis to mature into an independent investigator and provide a basis for an R01 to implement real-time phylogeny to direct prevention interventions and track trends in HIV incidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV transmission continues in the U.S. despite comprehensive prevention measures; new strategies to find and interrupt chains of ongoing transmission are needed. Combining clinical, demographic, and behavioral data with analysis of highly related HIV nucleotide sequences will allow population-level transmission patterns to be uncovered and support the development of public health tools to better direct enhanced interventions, reducing HIV transmission.",Using Phylogenetics to Elucidate HIV Transmission Patterns and Inform

"Couples-Based HIV/STI Prevention for Drug-Involved, African American MSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to rigorously test the efficacy of a couples-based HIV and sexually transmitted infection (HIV/STI) preventive intervention for African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in same sex intimate relationships in which at least one partner is using stimulants (herein referred to as ""stimulant-using, African American MSM couples""). The proposed study is a logical progression from the investigative team's prior formative research to take an existing couples based intervention originally for heterosexual couples (""Connect"") and revise/tailor it for methamphetamine-using, African American MSM couples. The adapted intervention was pilot tested using a pre-/post-test design. Findings revealed statistically and clinically significant reductions in sexual and drug risk behaviors. In addition, this formative research informs the proposed study in several additional ways: (1) the importance of addressing stimulants beyond methamphetamine with African American MSM; (2) qualitative data on how a couples-based intervention can interrupt relationship dynamics more unique to drug-involved, African American MSM couples that lead to risk behavior; and (3) couples-based HIV prevention research is feasible, promising, and safe for stimulant using, African American MSM. This earlier research has culminated with a 7-session, manualized intervention entitled ""Connect 'n Unite"" (or CNU-pronounced ""seein' you""-for short) as a candidate couples-based HIV preventive intervention for stimulant-using, African American MSM couples. The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with 270 stimulant-using, African American MSM couples to test the impact of CNU versus a wellness promotion (WP) attention control condition on behavioral and biologically assayed outcomes over a 12-month follow-up period. The study has the following primary aims: (1) to test whether participants assigned to CNU engage in lower HIV/STI behavioral risk-fewer number of unprotected acts of anal intercourse, greater proportion of protected acts of anal intercourse, and fewer number of sexual partners-compared to participants assigned to WP; (2) to test whether participants assigned to CNU have lower cumulative incidence of STIs-chlamydia and gonorrhea-confirmed via biological assay compared to participants assigned to WP; and (3) to test whether participants assigned to CNU engage in less drug use and drug-related HIV risk (i.e., sex under the influence of drugs/alcohol) compared to participants assigned to WP. If successful, this study will advance the field by providing an evidence-based, innovative intervention that can be delivered in drug treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using, African American MSM. This study addresses the overrepresentation of the African American/Black community among those living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. as well as men who have sex with men (MSM), the transmission category that accounts for the majority of HIV infections. In the absence of a vaccine or cure for HIV infection, behavioral risk reduction represents the best public health tool for prevention of HIV transmission. The proposed randomized clinical trial will rigorously test an innovative, couples-based intervention targeting the intersection of stimulant use and sexual risk behavior among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, with the ultimate goal providing an evidence-based intervention that can be delivered in drug treatment and other service settings to reduce the spread of HIV among stimulant-using, African American/Black MSM.","Couples-Based HIV/STI Prevention for Drug-Involved, African American MSM",8852103,R01DA030296,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Attention ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Shoulder ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccines ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Drug user ', ' Life ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Qualifying ', ' Subgroup ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2015,561238,0.1358561539130522
"HIV intervention models for criminal justice involved substance-using Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such ""shocks"" lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM.

"Sexual Networks, Drugs, and HIV Risk among Men Who Have Sex With Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K01 award will provide Dr. Hong Van Tieu with the necessary training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in HIV epidemiology and prevention. Her short-term goals are to expand her experience in HIV epidemiology and prevention research among men who have sex with men (MSM), gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics, social network analysis, and qualitative research, and further the understanding of the influence of sexual networks on HIV and sexual risk behaviors among Black and White MSM. She will receive specialized training in the epidemiology of substance use and its relationship to HIV risk among MSM. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team has expertise in HIV and substance use epidemiology, prevention, and clinical research and strong track records of supporting junior faculty to become independently funded investigators. The New York Blood Center has a long history of conducting HIV epidemiology and behavioral and biomedical prevention research among MSM and is profoundly committed to the success of this K01 award. The dramatically disproportionate HIV infection rates among Black MSM in the U.S remain unexplained by differences in individual behavioral risk. One hypothesis is that the characteristics of sexual networks of Black MSM place them at increased risk of HIV compared to non-Black MSM. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM and to examine the relationship of their network characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors using an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The proposed research will enroll a large sample of Black and White MSM (n=878) in New York City as a substudy of an NIH R01-funded study to evaluate the hypothesis that certain structural (e.g., network size, density, partner concurrency) and compositional (e.g., assortative and disassortative mixing, durability of relationships) characteristics of Black MSM sexual networks increase the men's risk of HIV infection. The specific aims of this study are the following: (1) to describe and compare the structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, (2) to compare the association of structural and compositional characteristics of sexual networks with HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors between Black and White MSM at the egocentric network level, and determine whether differences in sexual network characteristics explain the disparity in HIV prevalence between Black and White MSM, and (3) to explore in depth the contexts and meanings of sexual partnerships and networks by evaluating how Black and White MSM subjectively experience their sexual networks and perceive them to influence their sexual risk behaviors using qualitative research methods. A focus of the research is on drug and alcohol use within sexual networks and their relationship to HIV risk among MSM. This research will provide critically important information on the sexual networks of Black MSM to explain the alarming rates of HIV infection among this population and to inform development and testing of sexual network-based intervention strategies to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission risk. It will also serve as an excellent platform for the candidate to gain essential training in HIV epidemiology and prevention research and generate innovative ideas for her first R01 grant application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The purpose of this study is to examine and compare the structure and make-up of sexual networks (connections between sexual partners) among Black and White men who have sex with men in New York City and assess the relationship of these characteristics to HIV infection and sexual risk behaviors. This study will have direct impact on the design of programs to reduce HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men.

"A Multilevel Network Model of Drug Use and HIV Racial Disparities in Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are disproportionately affected by HIV, with an annual incidence higher than any other age or race group. Despite this increasing epidemic, few studies have focused on MSM nor accounted for these disparities. The research that has examined disparities in MSM has been focused on understanding individual-level behavior, but this has been inadequate to explain HIV racial disparities. Additionally, network research is increasingly a priority area in HIV research due to the disease's high transmission dependence on drug and sexual network dynamics. However, network descriptions alone are also inadequate without considering the interplay of individual and contextual factors. Instead, it has been suggested that a broader systems-level perspective may be necessary as several interacting individual, network, and contextual differences may account for the increased epidemic in Black MSM populations. Due to this call for a systems-level perspective in understanding and preventing HIV infection, this grant seeks to advance understandings of HIV racial disparities in MSM by examining individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors within a multilevel network model. This model will be tested within an exceptional U01 NIDA-funded cohort of 1,200 diverse Chicago YMSM (PI: Primary Mentor Mustanski), which is collecting original multilevel (biologic, individual, dyadic, network) data. Utilizing methods developed within the applicant's R03 Project, YMSM will complete social (social, sexual, drug) and contextual (neighborhood & venue) network interviews. Building the study into the U01 cohort allows the current project to benefit from the strong infrastructure and resources of the U01, fortifies this project's feasibility, and provides unique opportunities to expand the aims of the U01. Data from this comprehensive longitudinal multilevel dataset will be used to build and validate a model of social contextual influences on racial disparities in HIV through innovative analyses and methods that account for the complex dynamics of HIV transmission and racial disparities. The overall project has two aims: 1) Identify social contextua factors (i.e., social relational and social contextual) which contribute to racial disparities in HV and 2) Examine the interplay of individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors in racial disparities in HIV. Additional sub- aims include: A) Compare the contribution of each level of analysis to racial disparities in HIV using innovative Multiple-Membership Multiple-Classification Models (MMMC) and B) Understand and validate the relations of individual, sexual network, and social contextual structures and attributes to racial disparities in HIV with ERGM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YMSM) have an alarming HIV/AIDS prevalence, yet the mechanisms driving these disparities are unknown. This proposal aims to examine social contextual influences on HIV disparities by building and validating a multilevel model and examining individual, network, and social contextual factors associated with HIV.                    ",A Multilevel Network Model of Drug Use and HIV Racial Disparities in Men,8847149,K08DA037825,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Social Controls ', ' Testing ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' social model ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2015,159896,0.03665592128056634
"PHASTT: A mobile Personalized HIV and STI Testing Tool for young Black men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the U.S. have a disproportionally higher incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Unrecognized and untreated HIV and bacterial STIs are likely fueling these disparities as they exist despite similar individual risk behavior compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Known barriers to HIV and STI testing and treatment include low perceived risks, difficulty accessing providers, lack of engagement in regular healthcare, stigma, and concerns about confidentiality. The recent development of two new technologies, mobile health applications on hand-held devices (mHealth) and home testing for HIV and STIs, offer potential solutions to engage young Black MSM in HIV and STI testing and treatment. The major goals of this research are to test whether a combination of technology-based interventions to increase access and awareness can overcome barriers to engaging young Black MSM in HIV and STI testing and treatment; and to understand key features that enhance uptake.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unrecognized HIV and STIs are likely driving new HIV infections among young Black men who have sex with men in the U.S. With advances in mHealth and home HIV and STI testing strategies, we seek to understand facilitators and barriers to their use, and leverage these technology advances to increase HIV and STI testing frequency and facilitate linkage to care for these men.                    ",PHASTT: A mobile Personalized HIV and STI Testing Tool for young Black men,8846249,K23MH104116,"['driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Awareness ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' information privacy ', ' Confidentiality ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Hand ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' career development ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' skill acquisition ', ' health application ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,K23,2015,180360,0.03617156821453413
"Center for AIDS Intervention Research Core Support DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes the renewal for 2014-2019 of the Center for AIDS Intervention Research (CAIR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin as an HIV behavioral research Center. CAIR's thematic mission is the conceptualization, conduct, and rigorous evaluation of interventions to prevent HIV infection in communities most vulnerable to the disease; the development of interventions to improve health outcomes among persons living with the disease; and the rapid dissemination of research findings to both the scientific community and public health service provides. The Center's Core structure supports the efforts of an interdisciplinary team of HIV prevention investigators, and CAIR has been highly productive and a strong regional, national, and international resource in the areas of research, training, and service to the scientific and public health communities. CAIR Investigators have made distinguished scientific contributions in the development of HIV prevention interventions for high-incidence populations in the United States, Eastern Europe, and other regions of the world; have advanced the field's scientific knowledge of how to transfer scientific advances to benefit service providers nationally and internationally; and have undertaken vigorous lines of behavioral and social science, methodological, and cost-effectiveness research applied to HIV prevention. CAIR's specific aims during the renewal period are: 1) the development of behavioral, social, and structural interventions that will lead to wide scale public health implementation of recently-emerging biomedical HIV prevention strategies; 2) establishing the effectiveness of multi-level HIV prevention interventions that combine potent behavioral, social, structural, and biomedical interventions to achieve greatest public health impact in reducing HIV incidence; 3) reducing HIV-related health disparities; and 4) serving as a resource that rapidly transforms scientific advances into sustainable public health practice. To support continued excellence in these areas, we propose a structure that brings together interdisciplinary teams and provides resources from the following Cores: Administration Core (Center strategic planning and oversight); Developmental Core (preliminary studies, internal peer review, Center conferences and professional development); Qualitative Core (qualitative and social science support); Quantitative Core (central data management, analysis, and biostatistical consultation); Intervention and Dissemination Core (intervention trial support and technology exchange initiatives); International Core (facilitating international initiatives); and Impact Science Core HIV prevention economic, modeling, and impact analyses).

"Addiction recovery residences to improve health outcomes in high-risk men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) adults face unique health disparities and addressing these disparities is a national health priority. Within this community, men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and other adverse health conditions. Addiction recovery residences are a promising mechanism to enhance outcomes among individuals who abuse substances, but the experiences of sexual minorities in these settings have been under-researched. To address this gaps in the literature, the proposed two-year, mixed-methods, formative research study has three specific aims: (1) To examine the service delivery components of a recovery residence serving MSM residents and how this residence may differ from residences not specifically designated for MSM residents; (2) To assess the feasibility of recruiting MSM residents and collecting baseline and 3-month follow-up data on substance abuse to estimate changes in HIV/AIDS risk behavior, health status, and service use; (3) To identify factors that may facilitate or inhibit the opening and operation of recovery residences for MSM and members of the larger LGBTI population. To address these aims, we will conduct in-person interviews with the owner and house managers of an organization that runs 12 recovery residences in Austin, Texas, including a home designated for MSM. We will also collect mixed-methods, computer-assisted telephone interviews with MSM residents (N=30) who live in these residences upon entry and at a 3-month follow-up interview. Finally, in order to better understand factors that may facilitate o inhibit the wider proliferation of recovery residences for segments of the LGBTI population, we will conduct key-informant interviews with recovery residence operators (N=10) in densely populated urban areas across the US who are affiliated with the National Alliance for Recovery Residences (NARR). The proposed study represents the first study of MSM experiences in recovery residences and the first study of an MSM recovery residence. Drs. Mericle (PI) and Polcin (Co-I) are among the few researchers in the nation who have conducted research on recovery residences and will be joined by Drs. Adam Carrico (Co-I) and Ronald Stall (Consultant) who have expertise in substance abuse and associated health problems among MSM. The findings from this study will enhance the understanding of the role that recovery residences can play in reducing HIV/AIDS risk among MSM. More importantly, this research will establish the magnitude of the effects that recovery residences may have on key health and service use outcomes among MSM, a critical first step to future trials of the effectiveness of recovery residences and services delivered in recovery residences to improve health outcomes among MSM and reduce health disparities among individuals in the larger LGBTI community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing health disparities among sexual minorities is national health priority. Addiction recovery residences are a promising mechanism to enhance outcomes among individuals who abuse substances, but the experiences of sexual minorities in these settings have been under-researched.

"Adapting the SiSTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW Prevention Trilogy for Black Men      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adapting the SISTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW HIV Prevention Trilogy  for Black Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have been disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic. Yet, there are very few scientifically demonstrated effective HIV prevention interventions targeting Black MSM. This SBIR Phase II project will address this gap and fill an important product niche for community-based organizations, health departments and clinics serving Black MSM by creating (1) a modular program package and online program builder to support the delivery of the popular SISTA/SIHLE/WILLOW HIV prevention suite with Black MSM; (2) an interactive, computer-delivered version of the adapted program; and (3) an online forum to provide updated resources and enable practitioners to share program implementation concerns and experiences. We will also conduct a 3-arm, quasi-experimental outcome study in three states to assess the effectiveness of these programs in reducing HIV risk behaviors among Black MSM. The project offers many innovations, including  the creation of the first evidence-based computer-delivered HIV prevention program specifically designed for Black MSM;  the development of a modular program package and online program builder to tailor program content for different sub-populations of Black MSM; the presentation of risk reduction activities within an explicit sexual health/harm reduction framework, an approach called for by practitioners and public health officials in recent years (Goldhanner & Mayer, 2011; Grossman et al., 2011; Wolitski & Fenton, 2011);  a discussion of the pros and cons of pre- exposure prophylaxis (PREP) as an HIV prevention strategy;  the inclusion of ""seroadaptive"" risk reduction practices (Wei et al., 2011) in the outcome study to assess the wide range of harm reduction practices currently practiced by Black MSM; and an online practitioner forum. In sum, the project's combination of a modular adaptation package, online program builder, computer-delivered intervention and practitioner forum provides a model to support the cost-effective implementation of evidence-based programs on a wide range of public health issues in diver implementation contexts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States, and Black MSM aged 18-29 have the highest new HIV infection rate of any group of MSM or African-Americans. This project will help reduce new HIV infections among Black MSM by (1) developing a version of the popular SISTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW HIV prevention trilogy specifically tailored for implementation with Black MSM; (2) creating a 2.5 hour long, computer-delivered version of the adapted program; and (3) conducting a quasi-experimental 3-arm trial to test the effectiveness of these programs. The project's combination of a modular adaptation package, online program builder, and computer-delivered intervention provides a model to support the cost-effective implementation of evidence-based programs to address a wide range of public health issues. The outcome study data will also further our understanding of how harm reduction strategies and computer technologies can be utilized to reduce disease risk and promote healthy behaviors more generally.            ",Adapting the SiSTA/SiHLE/WiLLOW Prevention Trilogy for Black Men ,8811871,R44MD005812,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Grant ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Language ', ' Love ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Play ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Sum ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Evidence based program ', ' usability ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,SOCIOMETRICS CORPORATION,R44,2015,140038,0.15415268518426384

MSM PRC is governed by a Community Coalition Board (CCB) that represents a partnership between the City of Atlanta's Neighborhood Planning Units T, V, X, Y and Z, three academic institutions and seven agencies (inclusive of state and local health departments). The CCB serves as a governing body with the majority being comprised of community residents and its Chair is always a community representative. Our research addresses priorities set by the CCB and the leading causes of health disparities and health problems in their communities.  The proposed core intervention research project seeks to expand MSM PRC's research scope and focus on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI's) among adolescents ages 14-18. The research to be undertaken is designed to address gaps in the efficacy and effectiveness literature related to HIV and STI prevention among African American youth. This research will address gender differences, the efficacy of a multi-component intervention vs. a single component intervention, and the efficacy of including parents in the intervention.  We propose a health promotion research intervention that will reach youth at local Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA's and community organizations using social media in a major social marketing campaign. The research will compare the effectiveness of four aims. Aim #1 will use the ""Be a Responsible Teen"" intervention; Aim #2 will include a social marketing intervention and a parental component; Aim #3 will be based on the HIV-RAAP intervention and will incorporate media literacy; and Aim #4 will constitute a comparison group. Ecological, Social Cognitive, and Cultivation theories and models will guide this research.               The Core HIV research project will address CDC's winnable battle on HIV and intends to impact public health by addressing the Healthy People (HP) 2020 HIV goal to prevent HIV infection and its related illness and death. This intervention research project seeks to reduce the incidence of primary HIV/STI infections among African American youth. The targeted populations in Healthy People 2020 and in this research study are persons disproportionately affected by HIV - African American youth.",Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center,8853809,U48DP005042,[''],NCCDPHP,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U48,2015,1139717,0.052986137101898007
"Syndemics and resilience for HIV transmission in a national sample of vulnerable DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay and bisexual men (GBM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 63% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2010 -they are among the only population in which infections are actually rising. The syndemics model has been applied to MSM finding considerable empirical support for a model in which several specific co-occurring psychosocial health problems (e.g., depression, substance use, trauma from childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence) compound risk for HIV. Yet this model does not account for resilience in the face of syndemic factors-there are GBM who experience syndemics and yet do not engage in hazardous (i.e., HIV risk) behavior. Yet, resilience too is not well understood among GBM. The proposed study builds from the syndemics framework by investigating patterns of resilience in a national US sample of GBM. We have partnered with Harris Interactive, Inc., a research firm that maintains the largest and most comprehensive database of GBM, to identify a national sample of 1,000 GBM to participate in a 3- year longitudinal study (Baseline, 12-, 24-, 36-months) investigating patterns and correlates of syndemic, protective, and resilient factors. We propose to collect behavioral and biological outcomes (at-home HIV and STI testing). We will: (1) Determine patterns and prevalence of syndemic factors and risk behavior in a national sample of GBM; (2) Conduct qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants to identify new/unmeasured mechanisms of resilience and to contextualize our quantitative data (Baseline and 36- months); and (3) Longitudinally track trajectories in resilience, syndemics, and HIV and STI incidence to identify psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with these changing trajectories. Our methodological design-including the use of a national sample, longitudinal assessments, biological testing for HIV and STIs-enhances this study's external validity and thus the impact of our findings. And by tracking patterns in syndemics and resilience, this study will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs. Our application addresses an important problem and barrier to progress in the field (a strengths-based approach to HIV prevention among GBM that goes above and beyond general protective factors to examine resilient factors among men with high risk for hazardous behavior). It has potential to improve scientific knowledge regarding HIV prevention efforts with GBM. And understanding resilience in the face of syndemics can change the conceptual approach, treatments, services, and interventions for a population that remains in critical need. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay and bisexual men are disproportionally impacted by HIV and STIs. Our investigation of factors that are associated with resilience, HIV risk behavior, and HIV/STI incidence over time will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs.

"Multilevel Influences on HIV and Substance use in a YMSM Cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) ages 16-29 are disproportionately affected by HIV, with high prevalence and incidence. While all other risk groups have declining rates of infection, dramatic increases are occurring among YMSM. YMSM are understudied, but preliminary research demonstrates that the HIV epidemic in YMSM forms a syndemic with drug use, violence, and mental health problems. The proposed study will build a dynamic dyadic-network cohort of 1,358 YMSM by hybridizing 2 existing cohorts of YMSM: Project Q2 (aged 20-24) and ChiGuys (aged 16-17). We will expand this unified cohort through the enrollment of serious sexual partners of core participants, thereby creating a dynamic dyadic network. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply a ""next generation"" multilevel model (Network-Individual-Resources model) to understand the syndemic among a cohort of YMSM and inform ""high-impact"" HIV prevention with this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1 is to understand how syndemics of substance use, HIV, STIs, mental disorders, and violence develop among YMSM using an accelerated longitudinal design. We will assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood, to describe the trajectories of syndemic development (including substance use) and use innovative statistical modeling to characterize different trajectories of syndemic development to predict youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. Aim 2 is to determine how dyadic processes influence HIV risk behaviors and transmission among YMSM by enrolling their serious sexual partners into the cohort. We will utilize dyadic data to identify which sexual partner and relationship factors are longitudinally related to unprotected sex and HIV/STI transmission across development. Phylogenetic analyses will link HIV transmissions within dyads to determine what behavioral, partner and dyadic factors predict such transmission. Aim 3 is to describe network and structural influences on syndemic development among YMSM. We will examine how sexual and drug use network structure Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM). The objective of this proposal is to build a large and innovative dynamic dyadic-network cohort of YMSM and their serious sexual partners in order to delineate multilevel influences on HIV and substance use. This cohort will serve as a strong resource platform for a wide range of future innovative research efforts and will inform behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention interventions for YMSM.

"Understanding Delayed Access to HIV Prevention Services among Black MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV AIDS remains a major health crisis among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). In a recent large-scale HIV seroprevalence survey, prevalence rates were highest among AA MSM (28%), compared to 16% among MSM of all other ethnicities. This is a health disparity that has been replicated in many different studies since the start of the AIDS epidemic. Given the scale of the HIV epidemic among AA MSM, we cannot prevent the ongoing spread of HIV in the United States until we find ways to field effective HIV prevention programs for AA MSM. Combination prevention approaches to HIV/AIDS offer considerable promise to achieve this goal by addressing some of the high risk contexts that increase transmission risk among AA MSM. However, our ability to design effective combination prevention approaches to lower HIV transmission risk among AA MSM depends on achieving a clear epidemiological understanding of both barriers and facilitators to HIV testing, receiving reactive test results for men who are HIV positive and timel access to medical care if HIV positive. Unfortunately, our ability to explain HIV testing and health care access behaviors among AA MSM is currently limited due to the difficulties of recruiting sufficiently large samples of AA MSM who are delaying access to HIV prevention and care services. These shortcomings hamper our ability to draw effective conclusions about targeted prevention efforts for AA MSM, including most fundamentally an informed evidence base upon which combination prevention strategies must be built. Syndemics theory, which examines the effects and interactions among multiple psychosocial health conditions (i.e. substance abuse, depression, violence victimization) associated with increased risks within marginalized and vulnerable populations provides an important theoretical framework to examining these behaviors, especially since it encompasses both vulnerabilities and resiliencies in high risk populations. This application proposes to address this situation by collecting data from a large scale sample of AA MSM (N=6000) to: 1. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of uptake of HIV testing among AA MSM 2. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of unknown HIV seropositivity among AA MSM 3. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of timely access to care among HIV+ AA MSM By partnering with well-established community groups to recruit large samples of vulnerable men, we will be in a position to characterize the barriers and facilitators to the essential buildig blocks of combination prevention approaches and so provide crucial information for developing effective programs to lower HIV transmission among AA MSM.

"STAR-Seek, Test and Retain. Linkages for Black HIV+, Substance Using MSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic in the United States most severely affects men who have sex with men (MSM): 57% of all new infections occur in this population. Black MSM bear a disproportionate burden, with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV testing less frequently than other MSM; are less likely to be aware that they are HIV infected; are more likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care; and are less likely to be prescribed ART when eligible. These disparities are pronounced in substance using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis and delayed engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM behavior and high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this population, even as the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches 50%. Reducing HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS Strategy priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the US. Setting: The study will seek and recruit substance-using Black MSM in New York City for HIV testing and will link and retain those who are HIV-infected in HIV primary care. Study Aims: In response to the urgent public health need to seek substance-using Black MSM, identify those with HIV infection, and link the latter to HIV services, the study aims are as follows: Seek and Test: Respondent driven sampling (RDS) will be used to recruit substance-using Black MSM for HIV testing. RDS has been used in HIV surveillance among hard-to-reach populations and, to a limited extent, as a strategy for engaging hard-to-reach populations in services. We will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS to seek, recruit, and offer HIV testing to this high-risk population. Link and Retain: Participants with reactive rapid HIV test results and who are not currently in care will be randomized to two linkage and retention strategies: patient navigation (PN) and financial incentives (FI). One hundred participants will be randomized into each arm of the study. The primary objectives are: 1) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using RDS for seeking and recruiting substance-using Black MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition for rapid HIV counseling and testing; 2) to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using two interventions, PN and FI, for linkage and retention in HIV care; and 3) to assess the cost-effectiveness of PN and FI for linkage and retention in HIV care. This study has the potential to identify effective methods to seek and test substance-using Black MSM, to link the HIV infected to services, and to retain them in care and treatment. The success of such an effort responds to priorities with the national HIV strategy. Results will inform innovative approaches to engaging highest-risk, difficult-to-reach individuals in HIV counseling and testing and retaining them in care and treatment. The proposed project will test the feasibility of an innovative method to recruit substance-using African-American men who have sex with men into counseling and testing for HIV, and for those who are found to be HIV-infected, into one of two interventions to facilitate retention in HIV care. These two interventions are: peer navigation and financial incentives. This project has the potential to increase timely diagnosis of HIV and retention in HIV primary care among populations disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US, and most burdened by multiple barriers to appropriate care.","STAR-Seek, Test and Retain.

"Assessing HIV Risk and Prevention Locations among Men who have Sex with Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant In the United States, most HIV infections occur in men who have sex with men (MSM). Given the continued high numbers of new HIV diagnoses and differences by race and ethnicity, it is critical to develop a deeper understanding of the context of new infections in order to better target existing resources and to develop new prevention approaches. To examine the roles of place-based and non-individual risk factors systematically, the places where MSM engage in specific behaviors must be systematically defined, and associations between these locations, their characteristics and geographic relationships, and specific HIV-related behaviors must be quantified. By better defining the space in which behaviors occur, place-based studies can also aid in our understanding of structural barriers to early HIV diagnosis and treatment and of structural determinants of risk behaviors. Therefore, an examination of specific locations representing the everyday lives of MSM may be useful in refining the understanding of HIV epidemiology and in targeting HIV prevention and treatment resources. Within this context, this research will address three aims. First, this research will examine the willingness of MSM to specify locations of HIV prevention and risk behaviors using an online map-based tool. Prior studies have validated an online map-based tool for collection of geolocated HIV-care locations among HIV-positive MSM. However, more thoroughly examining places associated with risk and prevention requires a larger sample of MSM, both HIV-negative and HIV-positive, and a willingness of MSM to report information about a broad range of locations. A large sample of MSM will use this online tool to provide various locations associated with HIV risk and prevention. Relationships between a willingness to answer these questions and age, race, and other health and socioeconomic factors will be explored. Second, this research will examine specific locations of risk and prevention behaviors among MSM. Using the concept of activity space, the distance and spatial spread of home and other locations will be quantified, and associations between these geographic distributions and HIV risk and prevention behaviors will be measured. Additionally, these measures may differ by race and level of urbanicity, providing potential information about racial and geographic disparities in HIV Finally, this research will examine migration patterns of MSM. Using data collected from the online survey, life course epidemiologic methods will be used to examine relationships among migration, and HIV risk and prevention behaviors. These methods allow simultaneous exploration of associations between risk and prevention behaviors and both timing and amount of migration. Given our large sample size, potential differences across urbanicity and by race/ethnicity will be observed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By seeking to better understand associations between places and HIV-related behaviors, including unsafe sex, HIV testing, and HIV treatment, this work will allow public health practitioners to geographically target HIV prevention and treatment activities for greater effect, to more fully understand differences in HIV epidemiology by both race/ethnicity and level of urbanicity, and to better understand fundamental assumptions of HIV surveillance data. The proposed research also explores the acceptability of a web-based tool to collect place-based data, permitting other researchers to collect similar data for future studies.           ",Assessing HIV Risk and Prevention Locations among Men who have Sex with Men,8924535,F31MH107343,"['Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' willingness ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' spatial relationship ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,0.1308394116516148
"Behavioral and institutional barriers to HIV prevention among migrant women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for collaborative U.S.-Russia research on HIV prevention among migrant women in the Russian Federation is submitted to the NIH in conjunction with a parallel application submitted by the Russian collaborators to the Russian Foundation for Basic Research. It builds upon the international team's completed and current NIH-supported pilot work in Russia as well as the US investigators' extensive cross-national research on migration and HIV. It proposes a novel combination of population-level quantitative and qualitative analyses with analyses of institutional dynamics to describe HIV risks of irregular female migrants from three Central Asian countries- Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan and to identify challenges and barriers in HIV prevention and mitigation faced by this vulnerable group. Specifically, the study will collect statistically representative survey data on migrant women from Central Asia in two Russian cities recruited through respondent driven sampling and qualitative information from a subsample of those women and their sexual partners. In addition, institutional ethnographies, including interviews with service providers and observations of provider-client interactions, will be carried out at clinics offering sexual and reproductive health and HIV/STI services to migrant women. The analyses will focus on: women's negotiation of HIV risk reduction with their sexual partners; women's use of their personal networks to obtain information about HIV risks and prevention, to evaluate their risks, and to take actions aimed at reducing those risks; and women's interactions with the formal health care sector and the provider- client gaps and disconnects that characterize those interactions. The results of this exploratory study will lay the foundation for subsequent design and testing of culturally-grounded, gender-sensitive, nationally-scalable interventions aimed at reducing the risks of HIV infection among migrant women and improving their access to HIV counseling, testing, and treatment services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed US-Russian collaborative study will examine HIV risks and barriers to HIV prevention among migrant women from Central Asia in the Russian Federation. Building on the research team's extensive prior work on migration and HIV, the study will collect quantitative and qualitative data to analyze women's use of both informal and formal resources to navigate and reduce HIV risks.

"Peer-driven Intervention to Seek, Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 21% of HIV infections in the U.S. are undiagnosed, but only about 40% of all adults have been tested. Thus, late diagnosis of HIV is common, and, furthermore, treatment delays and disruptions are widespread. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to test for HIV, are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late, and experience serious barriers to entering care compared to other groups. Our research team has studied HHR in New York City (NYC) as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) studies. We found an HIV prevalence rate of 7.4% among HHR in NYC, and only 6% of these infections had been previously diagnosed. Further, in central Brooklyn, 10% were newly diagnosed with HIV. The proposed study will use NHBS methodology to target HHR. Reduced rates of HIV testing and treatment among HHR are due to structural (e.g., poor access), social (e.g., peer norms), and individual-level (e.g., low perceived risk) barriers. Thus active recruitment approaches modeled after NHBS are needed to overcome structural barriers, and peer-delivered interventions effectively reduce individual and social barriers to testing and treatment. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-level enhanced peer-driven intervention (PDI) to seek, test, treat and retain HHR. The enhanced PDI is tailored specifically for HHR and includes computerized, navigation, and peer-delivered components to enhance future sustainability. The design of the intervention is guided by the Theories of Triadic Influence and Normative Regulation. Similar to NHBS, the enhanced PDI will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS). NHBS protocols use both venue-based sampling (VBS) and RDS for reaching populations at high risk. However, VBS and RDS have not yet been directly compared in terms of their yield of undiagnosed HIV infections. Thus the specific aims of this five-year proposed study are to: (1) compare the yield and efficiency of RDS and VBS to identify undiagnosed HIV infection among HHR; (2) measure the efficacy of an enhanced PDI compared to a control in terms of time to HIV care and HAART initiation, viral load suppression, and retention among those newly diagnosed; (3) examine whether the effects of the PDI on HIV health/treatment outcomes are mediated by changes in individual (e.g., perceived risk), social (e.g., peer norms), and structural influences (e.g., enhanced access), and/or whether other factors (e.g., substance use) moderate its effects; and (4) to project the costs and cost-effectiveness of RDS vs. VBS and PDI. We will conduct the enhanced PDI (N=3000) in central Brooklyn, a location hyperendemic for HIV and where HHR experience poor access to testing and treatment. Simultaneously, VBS (N=400) will be undertaken in central Brooklyn. The proposed study complements local and national HIV prevention initiatives and is designed to contribute an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. The vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino; therefore the proposed study may also impact racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS. Heterosexuals at high risk (HHR) are significantly less likely to have been tested for HIV, do not test as frequently, and are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV late compared to other risk groups. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to develop an efficient, innovative, and sustainable multi-level recruitment approach and intervention to the HIV prevention portfolio. Because the vast majority of HHR are African-American or Latino, the project has great potential to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.","Peer-driven Intervention to Seek, Test & Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV",8840205,R01DA032083,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appointment ', ' Attention ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' LAV-2 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 2 ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type IV ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 ', ' HTLV-IV ', ' HIV2 ', ' HIV-II ', ' HIV-2 ', ' Infection ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Respondent ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' episodic drinker ', ' bout drinker ', ' binge drinker ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' surveillance study ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,756673,0.006129866322935212
"HOME: A Comprehensive HIV Testing and Linkage Package for Young MSM of Color DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HOME is a project whose aim is to increase rates of HIV testing among young African American and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM). Young African American and Latino MSM have higher rates of HIV infection than all other groups, are more likely not to know they are HIV infected, and less likely to get adequate HIV care. To break the cycle of HIV transmission in these populations, the HOME project will harness the power of home HIV tests, soon to be licensed for over-the-counter use. We will also use new technologies for communication, such as online videos, social networking, SMS texting, and telemedicine (live video linkage from patient to clinician) to build a support network for young men to test and get linked into care. The final project will be a clinical trial in Oaklad and San Francisco to evaluate whether the HOME package is desirable and increases HIV testing rates and/or access to services in young MSM of color. If successful, the components of HOME are developed so they can be scalable to many parts of the country. The HOME project is designed to break the cycle of HIV infection between young African American and Latino men who have sex with men.

"Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the happy consequences of HAART is that HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals now have available to them medications that allow them to reach old age. This means that we have the previously unexpected challenge of finding ways to support healthy aging in communities with high HIV prevalence rates. This challenge is likely to be particularly difficult among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to not only their very high background HIV prevalence rates but also the general dearth of proven models to promote healthy aging among older MSM. To meet this challenge, we need to develop health promotion programs that are more potent than the efficacious but time-limited effects found among HIV prevention interventions. Thus, we need to identify mechanisms to raise levels of intervention efficacy to support healthy aging beyond those that have already been tapped to support other health promotion efforts among MSM. In previous research by our group, we documented that specific resiliencies among MSM appear to have robust health-promoting properties. Resiliencies research conducted among aging MSM is an innovative agenda on several counts. The dominant approach to explaining patterns of health among MSM has been to study the effects of deficits in creating health disparities. While an emphasis on deficits is useful in explaining the life course trajectories of men who have multiple psychosocial health problems that result in poor health outcomes, this focus is less helpful in explaining the trajectories of te far larger proportion of MSM who have also experienced cultural marginalization and yet remain healthy well into later life. This application proposes the following aims to test a theory-based approach to identifying both deficits and resiliencies among aging MSM over six waves of data collection (N=1850) using an ongoing cohort study.1)To measure changes in prevalence rates of psychosocial health problems and resiliencies over time; 2)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with changes in substance use and other psychosocial health problems and to test whether resiliencies moderate the pathway to syndemics; and 3)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with better HIV-related outcomes and biomarkers among HIV-positive MSM and to test if resiliencies moderate the impact of syndemics on these same outcomes. By identifying the resiliencies already used by some aging MSM to stay healthy but which have yet to be incorporated in current health promotion efforts for MSM, we can progress to the testing of potentially efficacious health promotion programs to support healthy aging among MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although many older men who have sex with men (MSM) exhibit significant strengths that have helped them remain healthy well into later life, these strategies have not been well documented. In particular, the strengths, or resiliencies, of older MSM have not been carefully studied in terms of their ability to support health as men age. This study will use a theory-based approach to follow aging MSM in six waves of an ongoing cohort study to document how resiliencies moderate the effects of health risks to better explain patterns of health and illness among aging MSM.",Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men,9150674,R01MD010680,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' violent partner ', ' partner violence ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' healthy aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Homophobia  ', ' Homophobic ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' rate of change ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,592277,0.08162792676186323

"Sexual Networks and HIV Transmission Clusters among Substance Using MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Heather A. Pines with the training and experience needed to facilitate her transition toward research independence in HIV prevention science. Dr. Pines' career development plan is designed to augment her training in epidemiology and allow her to: 1) develop expertise in social network analysis, 2) acquire skills in the use of genetic sequence analysis methods to identify HIV transmission clusters (i.e., individuals with genetically related HIV infections), 3) obtain further training in the ethical conduct of research, and 4) build the sklls necessary for a successful academic career. These training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, hands-on research, and mentoring from an interdisciplinary team of experts. Global disparities in resource allocation to HIV prevention services may limit the promise of recent breakthroughs in HIV prevention science, particularly among vulnerable substance using populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Innovative research that integrates social network and genetic sequence analysis methods to direct the delivery of biomedical HIV prevention strategies to individuals at greatest risk may help maximize their impact, control costs, and facilitate their implementation in the context of limited prevention resources. To this end, the overall objective of Dr. Pines' research project is to inform the development of comprehensive HIV prevention programs that leverage information on sexual network characteristics to interrupt HIV transmission among MSM in LMIC. The project will be embedded in a NIDA study among MSM in Tijuana, Mexico (R01DA037811; PI: Patterson), to capitalize on its research infrastructure and the expertise of its bi-national collaborators, and provide Dr. Pines with the opportunity to apply her newly acquired skills in social network and genetic sequence analysis. Pilot data suggest elevated rates of substance use and associated sexual risk behaviors may be driving the HIV epidemic among MSM in Tijuana. Thus, understanding the impact of substance use on sexual network characteristics and HIV transmission dynamics among MSM will be a major focus of this research. Specifically, the project aims to: 1) examine the influence of mean degree (number of male anal intercourse partners), the degree distribution, and sexual mixing patterns on overall sexual network structure among MSM; 2) identify individual, sexual network compositional, and socio-contextual factors associated with degree; and 3) determine whether sexual mixing patterns are associated with HIV transmission cluster membership. Findings from this project will be critical to Dr. Pines' development of an R01 proposal that integrates epidemiologic, social network, and genetic sequence analysis methods to advance HIV prevention science. These training and research activities will position Dr. Pines as the only researcher in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego with this unique skill set and enable her to develop an independent research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in HIV prevention science could significantly reduce HIV incidence worldwide.1 However, their promise may be limited among men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where HIV prevention resources for MSM populations are limited.2 The proposed training and research activities will enable the candidate to apply interdisciplinary research methods to investigate MSM sexual networks in Tijuana, Mexico in order to direct the delivery of scarce prevention resources and support the development of cost-effective,

"Effects of Individual and Structural-Level Factors on Sex Risk and STI in High-Risk MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In addition to being the subgroup with the highest HIV incidence, men who have sex with men (MSM) are also disproportionately affected by other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which make it more likely for HIV transmission to occur. For example, in 2012, MSM accounted for three-quarters of all primary and secondary syphilis infections11. Additionally, MSM were found to be more likely to be infected with strains of gonorrhea which are resistant to antibiotic drugs20,29. Evidence further suggests that a racial disparity within the MSM community may exist where Blacks and Hispanics have shown a steeper increase in STI infection relative to their non-Hispanic white counterparts 53. In addition to being disproportionately affected by STIs, recent empirical work has also suggested that nearly one-in-three MSM has experienced childhood sexual abuse (CSA)37. CSA has been associated with increased use of avoidance coping50 and substance use37,41 in order to remedy negative affect. It has also been linked to increased PTSD symptom expression38. Each of these individual-level psychological variables is thought to be a determinant to STI infection as they've been linked to STI acquisition and transmission16,52,44. However, these psychological factors alone fail to account for the ways in which systemic social factors may play a role in disproportionate rates of STI infection 12. Structural factors such as poverty, unstable housing, and neighborhood crime have also been linked to increased sexual risk3, 15, 30, 35.These social determinants have also been associated with STI infection 1, 6, 35. The current proposal seeks to investigate both psychological (avoidance coping, substance use, and PTSD symptomology) and social (poverty, unstable housing, and neighborhood crime) determinants and relate them to sexual risk and STI infection both cross-sectionally and longitudinally among high-risk MSM with histories of CSA. The proposal seeks to model baseline interrelationships between psychological/social determinants and sexual risk (Aim 1) and self-reported STI infection in the past year (Aim 2). We will evaluate the effects of racial identity on these relationships. It then seeks to longitudinally examine the impact of psychological and social determinants on the trajectory of sexual risk over 12 months (Aim 3). Lastly, the proposal will employ a prospective longitudinal design to examine how psychological/social determinants affect likelihood of acquiring an STI over the course of 12 months (Aim 4). Findings from this study may better inform us of relative risk associated with psychological and social determinants. This can be used to design structural interventions aimed at reducing the disparity in STI incidence for MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ameliorating the ethnic/racial disparity that exists in sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among men who have sex with men (MSM) is a critical public health concern as untreated STIs facilitate HIV transmission. Understanding the relationship between both individual-level and structural factors and sexual risk behavior/STI acquisition is an important benchmark in the realization of this goal as structural factors have been understudied. Structural factors must be studied with individual factors to ascertain the relative degree of risk associated with each in an effort to inform innovative structural interventions designed to reduce STI transmission in at-risk populations of MSM.            ",Effects of Individual and Structural-Level Factors on Sex Risk and STI in High-Risk MSM,9068675,F31MH107315,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Crime ', ' Cross Infection ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Investigation ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' psychosocial ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Low income ', ' Symptoms ', ' Psychological Impact ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' distress tolerance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial minority ', ' racial identity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,F31,2016,43576,0.07747644771001976

"A New Approach to Integrating Primary and Secondary HIV Prevention in Young Male Couples Project Summary Adolescent and young adult men who have sex with men (YMSM) are the only group in the U.S. where rates of new HIV infections are increasing, which reflects a large disparity relative to heterosexuals. Steady or main partner relationships account for a substantial proportion of new HIV infections in YMSM. Among YMSM a serious relationship status is perhaps the strongest predictor of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), and pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may also be discontinued in a relationship. Alcohol and drug use are important influences on HIV risk in YMSM, particularly in serious relationships. Romantic relationships also provide myriad benefits, including promotion of mental, behavioral, and physical health. Despite the critical importance of romantic relationship factors for HIV prevention, the vast majority of studies and interventions focus on individuals. My research team and I conducted formative research on coupled YMSM through an NIH R21 from which I developed an innovative couples-based intervention that addresses the continuum of HIV prevention and care for YMSM couples. The 2GETHER program integrates couples- and group-based modalities and is innovative in its design to address HIV transmission risk in couples regardless of serostatus; couples learn to utilize behavioral and biomedical approaches to prevent both HIV acquisition and transmission, with an overarching emphasis on improving relationship functioning. 2GETHER further encourages uptake of couples- based HIV testing for HIV-/unknown YMSM and addresses medication adherence and barriers to care for HIV+ YMSM. I established feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy 2GETHER in a pilot trial of coupled YMSM (N=52 couples; 104 individuals), including significant decreases in HIV transmission risk behavior. My pilot focused primarily on prevention of risk behavior, and given its highly promising effects, I now take an important scientific risk to also evaluate its effects on engagement in care. I propose to test the efficacy of 2GETHER in a comparative effectiveness RCT relative to existing public health practice (PHP). I will: (a) enroll racially diverse coupled YMSM; (b) randomize couples to either the 2GETHER intervention or PHP (couples voluntary HIV counseling and testing for HIV- YMSM; Life-Steps HIV medication adherence for HIV+ YMSM); (c) measure intervention outcomes through 12 months post-intervention. Primary behavioral outcome: an individual-level transmission risk variable for both HIV+/- men calculated based on relative risk of sex acts (a traditional CAI outcome will also be examined). Primary biomedical outcome: Chlamydia/Gonnorhea incidence. Secondary outcomes: HIV incidence and HIV testing uptake (HIV- men), viral load (HIV+ men), and substance use problems and relationship functioning as these are mediators of HIV risk. In the context of increasing fatigue for HIV prevention, I believe a healthy relationships program for coupled YMSM presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Further, in the era of treatment as prevention, we must develop transmission prevention strategies for MSM regardless of serostatus that address the full continuum of prevention and care. Project Narrative Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM), but YMSM report increasing fatigue with HIV prevention messages and strategies. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among YMSM by establishing the efficacy of an innovative, healthy relationship program for coupled YMSM (regardless of HIV status) that aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies, as well as primary and secondary prevention approaches.",A New Approach to Integrating Primary and Secondary HIV Prevention in Young Male Couples,9179853,DP2DA042417,"['Accounting ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Mental health promotion ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Relative Risks ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' post intervention ', ' pilot trial ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' YMSM ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ']",NIDA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,DP2,2016,2317500,0.07045267361815401
"Center/Coordination, Analysis and Management/MACS This application is to renew the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a comprehensive quality-assured  prospective cohort study of over 7000 men, which has contributed almost 1300 research papers on the  natural history of HIV infection and the impact of effective combination antiretroviral therapies (cART). The  follow-up of the existing cohort with continuing dynamic enrollment will enable elucidation of long-term  effects of cART, including newer and evolving cART regimens, in men who have sex with men (MSM), the  largest population impacted by HIV in the U.S. The overarching goals of the MACS are to continue to  elucidate the biology of infection and the clinical outcomes of treated and untreated infection, combining  immunologic, virologic, genetic and psychosocial approaches. The scientific agenda of the MACS focuses on  four primary areas: 1) clinical epidemiology of HIV-related and non-AIDS-defining outcomes with particular  emphasis on the effects of cART and age; 2) pathogenic mechanisms underlying HIV susceptibility, disease  progression and treatment response including genetic and other molecular factors; 3) psychosocial factors,  including substance use which influence risk of HIV infection, co-morbidities and treatment utilization; and 4)  development of novel applied methodology. Following HIV-uninfected MSM with the same standardized  protocols will facilitate distinguishing the contributions of HIV, age, genetics,co-infections and behaviors on  the development of non-AIDS-defining outcomes including malignancies, and aging. The role of unresolved  inflammation and immune activation, and more rapid senescence of the immune system, on disease course  in treated HIV will be investigated. Data with linked specimens, particularly from over 700 HIV seroconverters,  provides an unparalleled resource for studying the entire natural history of HIV, ranging from pre-infection  (e.g. susceptibility) to infection, through treatment to old age and death. The MACS is and will  continue to be ideally positioned to address these issues because of its long-term standardized follow-up, an  extensive repository of over 1 million specimens that have been collected semiannually since 1984, an  appropriate control group of HIV- MSM, and a seasoned and expanding cadre of experienced investigators. In the US, the highest HIV incidence is among men who have sex with men (MSM), and with effective  treatment, the median age of HIV-infected persons is soon expected to be 50 years. The MACS is ideal for  elucidating biological and psychosocial effects of aging with HIV, and effects of evolving therapies on  biomarkers related to resulting outcomes. The proposed research will provide information for development of  vaccines for HIV as well as for the prevention of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining outcomes.","Center/Coordination, Analysis and Management/MACS",9032426,UM1AI035043,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Laboratories ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Seasons ', ' United States ', ' Coping Skills ', ' HIV vaccine ', ' human immunodeficiency virus vaccine ', ' HIV/AIDS Vaccines ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Natural History ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' vaccine development ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV risk ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Adherence ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Biology of HIV Infection ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Regimen ', ' immune activation ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,UM1,2016,4041453,0.05911057628208413
"A Multilevel Network Model of Drug Use and HIV Racial Disparities in Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are disproportionately affected by HIV, with an annual incidence higher than any other age or race group. Despite this increasing epidemic, few studies have focused on MSM nor accounted for these disparities. The research that has examined disparities in MSM has been focused on understanding individual-level behavior, but this has been inadequate to explain HIV racial disparities. Additionally, network research is increasingly a priority area in HIV research due to the disease's high transmission dependence on drug and sexual network dynamics. However, network descriptions alone are also inadequate without considering the interplay of individual and contextual factors. Instead, it has been suggested that a broader systems-level perspective may be necessary as several interacting individual, network, and contextual differences may account for the increased epidemic in Black MSM populations. Due to this call for a systems-level perspective in understanding and preventing HIV infection, this grant seeks to advance understandings of HIV racial disparities in MSM by examining individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors within a multilevel network model. This model will be tested within an exceptional U01 NIDA-funded cohort of 1,200 diverse Chicago YMSM (PI: Primary Mentor Mustanski), which is collecting original multilevel (biologic, individual, dyadic, network) data. Utilizing methods developed within the applicant's R03 Project, YMSM will complete social (social, sexual, drug) and contextual (neighborhood & venue) network interviews. Building the study into the U01 cohort allows the current project to benefit from the strong infrastructure and resources of the U01, fortifies this project's feasibility, and provides unique opportunities to expand the aims of the U01. Data from this comprehensive longitudinal multilevel dataset will be used to build and validate a model of social contextual influences on racial disparities in HIV through innovative analyses and methods that account for the complex dynamics of HIV transmission and racial disparities. The overall project has two aims: 1) Identify social contextua factors (i.e., social relational and social contextual) which contribute to racial disparities in HV and 2) Examine the interplay of individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors in racial disparities in HIV. Additional sub- aims include: A) Compare the contribution of each level of analysis to racial disparities in HIV using innovative Multiple-Membership Multiple-Classification Models (MMMC) and B) Understand and validate the relations of individual, sexual network, and social contextual structures and attributes to racial disparities in HIV with ERGM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YMSM) have an alarming HIV/AIDS prevalence, yet the mechanisms driving these disparities are unknown.

"Multilevel Influences on HIV and Substance use in a YMSM Cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) ages 16-29 are disproportionately affected by HIV, with high prevalence and incidence. While all other risk groups have declining rates of infection, dramatic increases are occurring among YMSM. YMSM are understudied, but preliminary research demonstrates that the HIV epidemic in YMSM forms a syndemic with drug use, violence, and mental health problems. The proposed study will build a dynamic dyadic-network cohort of 1,358 YMSM by hybridizing 2 existing cohorts of YMSM: Project Q2 (aged 20-24) and ChiGuys (aged 16-17). We will expand this unified cohort through the enrollment of serious sexual partners of core participants, thereby creating a dynamic dyadic network. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply a ""next generation"" multilevel model (Network-Individual-Resources model) to understand the syndemic among a cohort of YMSM and inform ""high-impact"" HIV prevention with this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1 is to understand how syndemics of substance use, HIV, STIs, mental disorders, and violence develop among YMSM using an accelerated longitudinal design. We will assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood, to describe the trajectories of syndemic development (including substance use) and use innovative statistical modeling to characterize different trajectories of syndemic development to predict youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. Aim 2 is to determine how dyadic processes influence HIV risk behaviors and transmission among YMSM by enrolling their serious sexual partners into the cohort. We will utilize dyadic data to identify which sexual partner and relationship factors are longitudinally related to unprotected sex and HIV/STI transmission across development. Phylogenetic analyses will link HIV transmissions within dyads to determine what behavioral, partner and dyadic factors predict such transmission. Aim 3 is to describe network and structural influences on syndemic development among YMSM. We will examine how sexual and drug use network structure Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM). The objective of this proposal is to build a large and innovative dynamic dyadic-network cohort of YMSM and their serious sexual partners in order to delineate multilevel influences on HIV and substance use. This cohort will serve as a strong resource platform for a wide range of future innovative research efforts and will inform behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention interventions for YMSM.

"Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM Project Summary/Abstract Racial/ethnic disparities in HIV have been a hallmark of the US HIV epidemic for decades, with black/African Americans experiencing higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans. These disparities are also observed in men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom the highest incidence rates are in young black/African American MSM (YBAAMSM). Despite a rich literature demonstrating the prevalent levels of drug and alcohol use among MSM and the potential relationships between these substances and high-risk sexual behaviors, individual risk behaviors do not explain why black MSM and YBAAMSM are more likely to become infected with HIV, compared to other MSM. Studies of self-reported use have collectively demonstrated no greater substance use among black MSM than among white MSM. However, a key finding of our previous R01, which examined factors associated with prevalent and incident HIV infection among a prospective cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta, was that black MSM had substantially lower validity of self-reported drug use, compared to white MSM. Biomarker-classified drug use was also more predictive of HIV seroconversions than self-reported sexual behavior measures, suggesting that, in this population, substance use may be a marker of high-risk partners and environments. Furthermore, the racial disparity in prevalent HIV infection was most associated with differences in network and community factors rather than individual factors. Despite emerging data on sexual partners and structures among YBAAMSM, little is known about the overlap of sexual and substance-use networks, though this might amplify HIV/STI transmission risk. Therefore, we propose to conduct a new prospective cohort study of 300 HIV-negative YBAAMSM in Atlanta, GA, to understand prospective patterns of biomarker-supported substance use in YBAAMSM, as well as its antecedents, contexts, and consequences. This new project will build on the strong institutional infrastructure, community partnerships, theoretical frameworks, analytical approaches, and multidisciplinary research that contributed to the success of our previous cohort study. Results will provide a more detailed understanding of the multilevel associations between substance use and HIV risk, and will yield new opportunities for combination interventions that address the syndemics of HIV/STI and drug use among YBAAMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Profound disparities in HIV incidence exist for young black/African American MSM compared to other subgroups of MSM. Substance use is prevalent and associated with HIV infection for young black/African American MSM, but the mechanisms by which substances impart added HIV risk are unclear. A cohort study of HIV-negative black MSM ages 18-29 is proposed to further understanding of the relationships between substances and HIV/STI incidence and risk behaviors, and suggest possible interventions.",Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM,9057496,R01DA038196,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Cocaine ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pre-clinical Drug Evaluation ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Community Networks ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' HIV risk ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Sentinel ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validity of Self Report ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' cocaine use ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' METH using ', ' METH use ', ' community partnership ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,643825,0.048950165357782495
"Activity Space Neighborhoods, Drug Use and HIV among Black MSM in the Jackson, MS MSA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project seeks to utilize real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods, drug use and HIV risk among Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan statistical area (MSA). We will recruit 150 Black MSM in the proposed study to address the aims of the research using multiple community-based methods implemented in our current and past portfolio of work in Mississippi. Eligibility requirements include: self-report as African American or Black race; report having had sex (any physical contact that could lead to orgasm) with another male in the past six months; aged 18-29 years; reside in the five-county Jackson, MS MSA; self-report no restrictions to usual physical activity; and willingness to complete a two-week GPS protocol. Consistent with previous research conducted in the Jackson, MS MSA, including the NIH-funded Jackson Heart Study, participants will be recruited from urban and rural areas of counties that make up the Jackson, MS MSA. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols we have used in our previous feasibility research projects. Of the 150 participants, fifty participants will be randomized to undergo two rounds of 2-week GPS protocol: at baseline, and after a 3-month follow-up period. Obtaining GPS data over time will enable us to understand the extent of spatial overlap in people's spatial patterns over time, which may vary in part due to seasonal variation. Findings from the proposed research will impact drug use and HIV prevention intervention activities. First, this research will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increasing community efforts to combat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender hate crime neighborhood rates through increased local police attention in high-crime locations may be an HIV prevention intervention. Second, given that we will know the travel patterns of Black MSM, we will be able to identify optimal geographic locations for drug use and HIV testing/prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions ar seldom geographically targeted. Third, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time (3-month follow-up) will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces change or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. If these risk environments change, this suggests that prevention needs to be very dynamic and fluid and perhaps need rapid change-detection feedback loops. Finally, this research will also facilitate the identification of geographic locations suitable for recruiting Blck MSM in research studies (an improved method of venue- based sampling), in this understudied group.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between GPS-defined activity space neighborhoods, drug use

"HIV intervention models for criminal justice involved substance-using Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such ""shocks"" lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations.

"Intervention to increase access to PEP to prevent HIV infection among Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black MSM in the US are affected by HIV at severely disproportionate rates. A key component of HIV prevention for communities at risk is increasing access to and uptake of biomedical HIV prevention, including pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP). PEP is underutilized by those at risk for HIV acquisition after exposure, despite the fact that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued the first PEP guidelines over 15 years ago. Numerous barriers to successful PEP treatment exist along the ""PEP cascade"" for Black MSM. Research on the PEP cascade and barriers is sparse, with almost none focused solely on Black MSM. Increasing access to and uptake of PEP among Black MSM has the potential to reduce racial disparities in HIV incidence. To address this gap, we propose to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a multi- component intervention designed to increase awareness of, demand for, and access to PEP among Black MSM at high risk of HIV infection. The intervention has three components: 1) a social media campaign to increase demand for PEP among Black MSM; 2) a 24-hour helpline to link patients to timely clinical care; and 3) a PEP advocate intervention, modeled on peer health navigation, to ensure medication access and sustain engagement. The research will involve three phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct formative research to inform the media campaign and the PEP advocate intervention. In Phase 2, we will translate the results of the formative research into optimal messaging across relevant social and print media and standardize the PEP advocate intervention. In Phase 3, to assess impact of the media campaign, we will evaluate social media metrics and calls to the helpline. To assess the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary impact of the PEP advocate intervention, we will survey the first 50 eligible helpline callers and all patients accessing PEP at the clinical study site at 1-week and 3-months post exposure to describe the following outcomes: PEP uptake and completion, PEP care engagement, incident HIV and STIs, HIV testing, PrEP use, sexual risk behavior, select psychosocial factors and receipt of health services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New HIV infections among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 13 to 24 increased by 133% between 2001 and 2011 in the United States (US) and HIV disproportionately affects Black MSM; a recent study reporting a 5.9% annual HIV incidence among Black MSM (aged 18-30) in 6 US cities. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can prevent infection among Black MSM, but is underutilized. This study propose to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary impact of a multi-component intervention designed to increase awareness of, demand for, access to and uptake of PEP among Black MSM at high risk of HIV infection.

"Web-facilitated intervention for heavy drinking and HIV risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Annual rates of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States continue to grow rapidly, despite stability or decline among other groups. This trend highlights the ongoing importance of developing new tools to fight the continued expansion of the HIV epidemic among MSM. Although a number of sex risk reduction interventions exist for MSM, important limitations have restricted their impact. These include barriers to dissemination and/or implementation, such as lengthy treatment protocols, the need for highly- trained interventionists, and confining delivery only to healthcare settings. Interventions have also failed to address pivotal factors that lead to high-risk behavior specifically heavy drinking. Research testing the efficacy of interventions to reduce heavy drinking among MSM is scarce, and has mostly only explored lengthier treatment protocols that span several weeks or months. Single-exposure intervention approaches for reducing heavy drinking based on the principles of motivational interviewing (MI), commonly referred to as ""Personalized Feedback Interventions,"" have been developed and tested in other populations with success. Similar brief interventions for HIV-risk reduction based on stages of change and MI-principles, such as Personalized Cognitive Counseling, have also been shown to produce meaningful reductions in unprotected sex among these individuals. These parallel lines of research highlight the opportunity for developing a brief, combined intervention for reducing both alcohol use and sex risk among MSM. Adapting and delivering these interventions via a technology-based or mHealth format would also begin to allow the extension of interventions beyond the traditional interactions and settings, potentially improving efficacy, flexibility, and scalability. As such, the proposed research will serve as the foundation for a research program focusing on developing technology-assisted tools that can be easily delivered to high-risk individuals. This three-year project aims to develop and pilot test a brief, combined intervention for reducing heavy drinking and unprotected sex among MSM based on principles of MI. This combined intervention will be adapted to a tablet- based format and developed specifically for use with high-risk MSM in community-based settings. The research involves two phases: Phase 1 involves conducting qualitative research to (1) integrate alcohol use and sex risk intervention components, (2) adapt them to a technology-based format, and (3) understand and address challenges in implementation, feasibility, and acceptability. Phase 2 entails conducting a randomized- controlled pilot test of the intervention among MSM seeking HIV testing in community-based settings to explore its potential impact on alcohol and HIV-related behavioral outcomes. This research will ultimately produce a combined, theory-based, and technology-delivered intervention for heavy drinking and sex risk that is fully portable and has been preliminarily tested for efficacy in community settings where high-risk MSM engage with prevention services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to develop a tablet-based intervention based on principles of motivational interviewing for use in community settings to help high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM) reduce heavy drinking and sex risks. These tools will help MSM at high-risk for HIV acquisition to evaluate their current behavior, consider options for change, and develop a plan for reducing harm. The research will thus provide prevention personnel with an evidence-based, low-cost, high-fidelity tool for reducing risk among high-risk MSM that present for voluntary HIV testing and

"RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV, interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present, only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. Our team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect, reductions in stimulant use, improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count, and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed randomized controlled trial addresses a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM). By utilizing contingency management as the platform for the delivery of an innovative positive affect intervention, this research could identify the first efficacious integrative intervention for promoting long-term reductions in HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM.

"PHASTT: A mobile Personalized HIV and STI Testing Tool for young Black men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the U.S. have a disproportionally higher incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Unrecognized and untreated HIV and bacterial STIs are likely fueling these disparities as they exist despite similar individual risk behavior compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Known barriers to HIV and STI testing and treatment include low perceived risks, difficulty accessing providers, lack of engagement in regular healthcare, stigma, and concerns about confidentiality. The recent development of two new technologies, mobile health applications on hand-held devices (mHealth) and home testing for HIV and STIs, offer potential solutions to engage young Black MSM in HIV and STI testing and treatment. The major goals of this research are to test whether a combination of technology-based interventions to increase access and awareness can overcome barriers to engaging young Black MSM in HIV and STI testing and treatment; and to understand key features that enhance uptake. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unrecognized HIV and STIs are likely driving new HIV infections among young Black men who have sex with men in the U.S. With advances in mHealth and home HIV and STI testing strategies, we seek to understand facilitators and barriers to their use, and leverage these technology advances to increase HIV and STI testing frequency and facilitate linkage to care for these men.",PHASTT: A mobile Personalized HIV and STI Testing Tool for young Black men,9012851,K23MH104116,"['driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Awareness ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' career development ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' health application ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Prevention trial ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,K23,2016,180360,0.03617156821453413

"A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM Project Summary  Adolescent (ages 13-18) men who have sex with men (AMSM) experience a dramatic health disparity as they represent 2% of young people but account for almost 80% of HIV diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based HIV prevention programs. Implementation issues are critical as traditional HIV prevention delivery channels (community organizations, schools, parents), have significant limitations when it comes to AMSM. eHealth interventions represent an excellent modality for delivering AMSM-specific intervention material where youth “are.”  We should not continue to deliver the same intervention when a participant is not responding. Rather, stepped-care strategies increase in intensity to meet the needs of those who do not respond to a less intense intervention. Using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, we will evaluate the impact of a package of increasingly intensive interventions that have already shown evidence of efficacy with diverse adolescent and young adult MSM. The SMART design is an ideal approach to achieve the goals of this RFA because SMART designs mimic treatment decisions as they are made in real-world clinical settings. Collectively we brand our package of eHealth interventions as the SMART Program (Sexual Minority Adolescent Risk Taking). The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis. Public Health Relevance Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group among youth in the US and rates of infections are increasing, however, few HIV prevention programs have been developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve public health by establishing the effectiveness of an innovative, eHealth HIV prevention program for YMSM.",A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM,9206727,U01MD011281,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Magic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' community organizations ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' sexual minority ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' YMSM ', ' queer ', ' trial design ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2016,1987674,0.03355851604940887
"Understanding disparities in effective HIV treatment and prevention: Involvement+ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MSM are a key risk group in the United States and are disproportionately impacted in terms of HIV prevalence and incidence. For decades, black/white disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence have been recognized. Much of the dialogue about disparities has focused on what might cause disparities in new HIV infections, and we recently completed an NIMH-supported R01 (InvolveMENt) to examine reasons for black/white HIV disparities in an HIV/STI incidence cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta. An early, important finding from that study is that HIV-negative black MSM, while having comparable levels of individual risk behaviors, have a much greater chance of having a sex partner with a detectable HIV viral load - thus black MSM are at higher risk for acquiring HIV, despite comparable individual risk behaviors. But disparities extend beyond risks for infection: black MSM may fare less well in the treatment cascade because of later access to care, lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ARV), mistrust of providers, or, perhaps, stigma and discrimination. Recent national estimates have documented consistent racial disparities at each step of the HIV treatment cascade, culminating in a 30% lower likelihood of viral suppression among black non-Hispanic, compared to white non- Hispanic HIV-positive individuals. This pattern has been observed in the state of Georgia. In a Lancet systematic review in 2012, Millet et al. illustrated that the racial disparities after HIV infection are profound for MSM: black MSM were found to be less likely to initiate ARVT, less likely to adhere to therapy, and less likely to be virally suppressed. Further, this analysis suggested that structural factors, such as education, poverty, and lack of employment, played key roles in care disparities. Thus, we propose to build on our previous MSM cohort in Atlanta, to identify the factors that are prospectively associated with racial disparities in effective HIV care and prevention. The proposed work will build on the infrastructure, community relationships, multilevel conceptual framework and multidisciplinary team assembled for our previous grant, but will shift focus from HIV-negative MSM to those living with HIV. The design will be a prospective cohort of HIV-positive black and white MSM in Atlanta, with rich laboratory, survey, and qualitative data collections. Results will help provide deeper understanding of why disparities in care outcomes occur, and will provide actionable data for the development of interventions to reduce disparities in effective HIV care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Profound disparities in effective HIV care exist for black MSM compared to white MSM; the reasons are most likely related to structural and community factors. A cohort study of HIV-positive black and white MSM is proposed to further understanding of these disparities, and suggest possible interventions.",Understanding disparities in effective HIV treatment and prevention: Involvement+,9034539,R01AI112723,"['Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicaid ', ' Millet ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Community Networks ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Sentinel ', ' Provider ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,768729,0.10627880349808765
"HIV Risk, Drug Use, Social Networks: Homeless Persons Transitioned to Housing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We utilize a social ecological model to understand longitudinal changes in HIV risk and prevention behaviors among chronically homeless, predominantly African American men and women who transition into permanent supportive housing (PSH). Homeless persons face disproportionate risk of HIV and drug use. PSH is intended as the locus of integrated health services for this vulnerable population, yet there has been almost no research to understand HIV risk and prevention among residents, or the provision of HIV prevention services within PSH, except specifically for people living with HIV/AIDS. Some evidence suggests that transitioning to housing could increase rather than decrease risk behaviors over time, although research to clarify these complexities is absent.  Specific Aims are as follows: 1) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 2) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with changes in social networks of PSH residents, and how networks are associated with changes in HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 3) To examine how transition to PSH is associated with changes in drug use and mental health symptoms among PSH residents, and how changes in these individual characteristics are associated with HIV risk and prevention behaviors over time; 4) To determine whether and how PSH providers promote HIV prevention, and to understand policies and procedures that may impact HIV risk among residents; 5) To synthesize findings from Aims 1- 4 to inform specific strategies to reduce risk of HIV transmission and to enhance HIV prevention services for residents in PSH.  Aims 1-3 will be addressed through structured interviews (baseline, 3, 6, 12 months) with consecutive admissions to PSH (N=405 at 12 months). Aim 4 will be addressed through individual interviews with supervisory staff (N=30) and focus groups with front line staff (N=100) of PSH programs, and ethnographic shadowing of PSH residents (N=30). Aim 5 will synthesize findings of Aims 1-4 through focus groups with 50 PSH providers and 50 residents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The planned study is relevant to the public health because of its focus on understanding and reducing HIV risk in a highly vulnerable population: chronically homeless, predominantly African American individuals. The U.S. is investing in housing and supportive health services for chronically homeless persons yet faces a knowledge gap in the delivery of HIV prevention services to this population.","HIV Risk, Drug Use, Social Networks: Homeless Persons Transitioned to Housing",9012067,R01DA036345,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Homeless persons ', ' Housing ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Social Network ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' sexually active ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' transitionally housed ', ' transitional housing ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' supportive housing ', ' supported housing ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,697062,-0.019691306227088572
"Syndemics and resilience for HIV transmission in a national sample of vulnerable DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay and bisexual men (GBM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 63% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2010 -they are among the only population in which infections are actually rising. The syndemics model has been applied to MSM finding considerable empirical support for a model in which several specific co-occurring psychosocial health problems (e.g., depression, substance use, trauma from childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence) compound risk for HIV. Yet this model does not account for resilience in the face of syndemic factors-there are GBM who experience syndemics and yet do not engage in hazardous (i.e., HIV risk) behavior. Yet, resilience too is not well understood among GBM. The proposed study builds from the syndemics framework by investigating patterns of resilience in a national US sample of GBM. We have partnered with Harris Interactive, Inc., a research firm that maintains the largest and most comprehensive database of GBM, to identify a national sample of 1,000 GBM to participate in a 3- year longitudinal study (Baseline, 12-, 24-, 36-months) investigating patterns and correlates of syndemic, protective, and resilient factors. We propose to collect behavioral and biological outcomes (at-home HIV and STI testing). We will: (1) Determine patterns and prevalence of syndemic factors and risk behavior in a national sample of GBM; (2) Conduct qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants to identify new/unmeasured mechanisms of resilience and to contextualize our quantitative data (Baseline and 36- months); and (3) Longitudinally track trajectories in resilience, syndemics, and HIV and STI incidence to identify psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with these changing trajectories. Our methodological design-including the use of a national sample, longitudinal assessments, biological testing for HIV and STIs-enhances this study's external validity and thus the impact of our findings. And by tracking patterns in syndemics and resilience, this study will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs. Our application addresses an important problem and barrier to progress in the field (a strengths-based approach to HIV prevention among GBM that goes above and beyond general protective factors to examine resilient factors among men with high risk for hazardous behavior). It has potential to improve scientific knowledge regarding HIV prevention efforts with GBM. And understanding resilience in the face of syndemics can change the conceptual approach, treatments, services, and interventions for a population that remains in critical need. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay and bisexual men are disproportionally impacted by HIV and STIs.

"Addressing Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Current and Future Epidemics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related deaths now exceed HIV-related deaths in the US. Throughout the world, HCV is hyperendemic in people who inject drugs (PWID). New outbreaks of acute HCV infection are unfolding in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) and in 15-24 year olds who have transitioned from abuse of prescription opioids to illicit opiate injection. In patients with chronic HCV infection, 20-25% wil develop liver disease which may manifest as cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognosis for HCC is extremely poor, and HCV is the chief etiologic agent for this type of cancer. Recent discoveries in HCV prevention and treatment provide a great opportunity to reverse the trend toward increasing rates of HCV, HCV/HIV co-infection, and HCC. This study will use the methods of Implementation Science - research synthesis, mathematical modeling and simulation, and comparative effectiveness analyses - to determine how best to constitute a portfolio of interventions for the prevention and control of HCV and its consequences while taking into limited resources and underlying epidemiologic and social network features account. A dissemination plan will make extensive use of technology, including social media, and guidance from key stakeholders. These are our specific aims: 1. Synthesize evidence characterizing a) transition from misuse of prescription opioids to drug injection, b) HCV epidemiology and prevention for PWID and HIV+ MSM, and c) progression and treatment of HCV disease in these two groups, to derive best estimates to populate our HCV natural history and transmission models. 2. Use agent-based modeling to estimate the effects of scale-up of individual and combined prevention- and treatment-related interventions on HCV transmission and natural history in PWID and HIV+MSM. 3. Determine the combination of interventions for particular budget and epidemiologic scenarios that a) minimizes acute and chronic HCV infections, including HIV/HCV co-infection, b) prevents the greatest number of cases of HCV-related HCC and other serious sequelae, c) maximizes life expectancy and quality- adjusted life expectancy and d) reduces health disparities. 4. In collaboration with our Dissemination Advisory Board, apply an integrated knowledge-exchange approach to providing our target audiences (policymakers, public health and harm reduction practice communities, PWID and HIV+MSM) with the knowledge and tools to implement evidence-based HCV control strategies or reduce personal risk of infection and its consequences. The broad objective of this study is to provide an evidence base to guide allocation of scarce public resources in the US and other countries where HCV is principally transmitted among PWID. This will be accomplished by synthesizing, modeling and translating very recent developments in HCV epidemiology, prevention and treatment into practical tools to optimize population health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Statement The goal of this study is to help decision makers improve population health by providing guidance on the most effective set of interventions to control hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in people who inject drugs and HIV- positive men who have sex with men. In the US, HCV is the main causal factor in hepatocellular carcinoma which has a very poor prognosis, and HCV-related deaths now exceed deaths related to HIV. This research will synthesize evidence as to the effectiveness of different intervention strategies in terms of both individual benefit (preventing HCV infections in these populations, reducing HCC and other consequences of HCV), and in terms of societal benefit (reducing health care costs and impact on life expectancy).",Addressing Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Current and Future

"Using Phylogenetics to Elucidate HIV Transmission Patterns and Inform Prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a K08 award for Ann Dennis MD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, who is training to become an independent investigator in HIV transmission, epidemiology, and prevention. Despite marked advances in HIV treatment and prevention, new HIV diagnoses continue in the southeastern US where significant disparities still exist among racial minorities and men who have sex with men. Innovative methods are needed to successfully decrease incident HIV infections among these vulnerable groups. The identification of phylogenetic HIV transmission networks or ""clusters"", which are highly related sequences from individuals with shared HIV transmission, offers unique insight into the structure of HIV transmission on a population level that cannot be obtained through contact tracing or other patient-reported history. Paired with clinical and demographic data, these transmission clusters may provide new targets to direct HIV prevention efforts for groups at highest risk for ongoing transmission. The overall research objective is to characterize local phylogenetic clusters in North Carolina and investigate the use of phylogeny in the public health setting to target future interventions. The proposed study will employ innovative methods in molecular epidemiology to reconstruct transmission clusters using large repositories of HIV pol sequences extracted from antiretroviral resistance testing sent during routine clinical care. The aims of the study are to: 1) Identify the temporal and clinical features of emerging or expanding HIV transmission clusters in a large clinical cohort of new and established HIV cases; 2) Assess the effect of higher density sampling of prevalent HIV cases on the detection of transmission clusters and characterize the statewide epidemic structure; and 3) Determine feasibility of incorporating HIV sequence analysis into routine HIV surveillance in a circumscribed geographic area. Dr. Dennis's mentoring team will consist of primary mentor Joseph Eron, MD, Professor of Medicine at UNC with over 20 years of experience in HIV clinical and epidemiologic research. Two co-mentors will offer complementary areas of expertise in HIV epidemiology and phylogenetics: William Miller, MD, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine at UNC whose research focuses on HIV epidemiology; and Stephane Hue, PhD, virologist at University College London, an internationally recognized expert in HIV phylogenetics and UNC collaborator since 2010. Dr. Dennis' training plan links to the proposed research aims: establish a solid foundation in HIV epidemiology including surveillance and outbreak investigation; expand skills in phylogenetic analyses integrating time- scaled and geographic data; and explore ethical issues surrounding phylogenetics in HIV prevention. Training will be accomplished through a combination of didactic courses, workshops, and practicums. These training and research activities will allow Dr. Dennis to mature into an independent investigator and provide a basis for an R01 to implement real-time phylogeny to direct prevention interventions and track trends in HIV incidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV transmission continues in the U.S. despite comprehensive prevention measures; new strategies to find and interrupt chains of ongoing transmission are needed. Combining clinical, demographic, and behavioral data with analysis of highly related HIV nucleotide sequences will allow population-level transmission patterns to be uncovered and support the development of public health tools to better direct enhanced interventions, reducing HIV transmission.",Using Phylogenetics to Elucidate HIV Transmission Patterns and Inform

"Ethics in HIV Prevention Research Involving LGBT Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women are at alarmingly high risk for HIV, and the risk among women who have sex with women and transgender men is estimated to be at least as high as that of heterosexuals. However, there are no empirically recommended behavioral or biomedical HIV prevention programs for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth (LGBTY) under the age of 18 despite this clear evidence of need. A major reason for the absence of HIV prevention programs in this population is the challenge of initiating research on LGBTY under age 18. There is a lack of consensus among investigators and their IRBs about appropriate ethical procedures for protecting LGBTY's research rights and welfare. And, without empirical data to guide their decisions, IRBs must often rely on subjective judgments that can lead to over- or under-estimation of the magnitude and probability of risks of LGBTY participation in HIV prevention research. Consequently, many investigators have excluded LGBTY under 18 in HIV prevention research because of anticipated or actual difficulties obtaining IRB approval. This unfortunate exclusion prevents LGBTY from participating in research that has the potential to determine the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of HIV behavioral or biomedical preventive interventions that are developmentally appropriate for this population. The overarching goal of the current proposal is to inform evidence-based decision making by investigators and IRBs alike regarding the responsible design and conduct of HIV prevention research involving LGBTY. We propose to address this knowledge gap with three specific aims: (1) To inform ethically responsible decision making and IRB application of relevant federal regulations (46.102i; 46.111.a) to the evaluation of psychological, social and informational risk-benefits of LGBTY involvement in HIV prevention research. Using focus groups and surveys we will generate empirical data on LGBTY's appraisals of the magnitude and probability of the risks and anticipated benefits of recruitment strategies, risk behavior surveys, HIV/STI and drug use testing, and biomedical prevention trial participation. (2) To inform ethically responsible decisio making and IRB application of regulations permitting waivers of guardian permission (46.116d and 46.408c) for LGBTY participation in HIV prevention research. Using focus groups and surveys we will generate empirical data on LGBTY's appraisals of whether guardian permission is or is not a ""practical"" or a ""reasonable"" requirement for their participation in studies involvig risk behavior surveys, HIV/STI and drug use testing, and biomedical prevention trials. We will explore if these appraisals differ by youth characteristics (e.g., degree of ""outness,"" HIV risk). (3): To inform ethically responsible decision making and IRB application of regulations on youth capacity to consent (46.116d and 46.408c) for LGBTY participation in biomedical HIV prevention trials. Using a hypothetical HIV prevention trial, we will generate empirical data on the consent preparedness of LGBT youths' ages 14 - 17 compared to LGBT youth with adult legal status (18 - 20 years). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth under age 18 [LGBTY] are at high risk for HIV and other negative health outcomes. However, LGBTY are often excluded from research that has the potential to improve their health - particularly their rik of HIV infection - due to lack of knowledge on how to conduct research with this population in an ethical, responsible way. In hopes of ultimately reducing LGBTY's barriers to participating in HIV prevention research, the goal of this proposal is to assess LGBTYs knowledge of the risks and benefits of involvement in research related to HIV prevention, and the extent to which they are able to provide informed consent at a level equivalent to that of adults.",Ethics in HIV Prevention Research Involving LGBT Youth,9068678,R01MD009561,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Decision Making ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Judgment ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Legal Status ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Nature ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' psychosocial ', ' transgender ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Exclusion ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' age difference ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Regulation ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' waiver ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender men ', ' transmen ', ' transman ', ' trans-men ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' YMSM ', ' Prevention trial ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' women who have sex with women ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,473255,0.053487778039232416
"Addiction recovery residences to improve health outcomes in high-risk men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) adults face unique health disparities and addressing these disparities is a national health priority. Within this community, men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, and other adverse health conditions. Addiction recovery residences are a promising mechanism to enhance outcomes among individuals who abuse substances, but the experiences of sexual minorities in these settings have been under-researched. To address this gaps in the literature, the proposed two-year, mixed-methods, formative research study has three specific aims: (1) To examine the service delivery components of a recovery residence serving MSM residents and how this residence may differ from residences not specifically designated for MSM residents; (2) To assess the feasibility of recruiting MSM residents and collecting baseline and 3-month follow-up data on substance abuse to estimate changes in HIV/AIDS risk behavior, health status, and service use; (3) To identify factors that may facilitate or inhibit the opening and operation of recovery residences for MSM and members of the larger LGBTI population. To address these aims, we will conduct in-person interviews with the owner and house managers of an organization that runs 12 recovery residences in Austin, Texas, including a home designated for MSM. We will also collect mixed-methods, computer-assisted telephone interviews with MSM residents (N=30) who live in these residences upon entry and at a 3-month follow-up interview. Finally, in order to better understand factors that may facilitate o inhibit the wider proliferation of recovery residences for segments of the LGBTI population, we will conduct key-informant interviews with recovery residence operators (N=10) in densely populated urban areas across the US who are affiliated with the National Alliance for Recovery Residences (NARR). The proposed study represents the first study of MSM experiences in recovery residences and the first study of an MSM recovery residence. Drs. Mericle (PI) and Polcin (Co-I) are among the few researchers in the nation who have conducted research on recovery residences and will be joined by Drs. Adam Carrico (Co-I) and Ronald Stall (Consultant) who have expertise in substance abuse and associated health problems among MSM. The findings from this study will enhance the understanding of the role that recovery residences can play in reducing HIV/AIDS risk among MSM. More importantly, this research will establish the magnitude of the effects that recovery residences may have on key health and service use outcomes among MSM, a critical first step to future trials of the effectiveness of recovery residences and services delivered in recovery residences to improve health outcomes among MSM and reduce health disparities among individuals in the larger LGBTI community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing health disparities among sexual minorities is national health priority. Addiction recovery residences are a promising mechanism to enhance outcomes among individuals who abuse substances, but the experiences of sexual minorities in these settings have been under-researched.

"The Transnational Cohort: global HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transwomen bear a disproportionate burden of HIV worldwide, yet incidence is seldom measured and the determinants of acquiring infection are unknown. There is no HIV prevention intervention for transwomen with evidence of efficacy. Our project's goals are to create an international platform for HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen, obtain benchmarks for HIV incidence, and characterize causal factors for infection. We propose a cohort study of 1,100 transwomen in San Francisco, USA and São Paulo, Brazil where capacities are ready for longitudinal research. The cohort will measure HIV incidence and test hypotheses on HIV acquisition related to social and biomedical gender transition events and components of the Gender Affirmation, Behavioral Ecological, and Minority Stress models. Meanwhile, little is known about transwomen in China, the world's largest country, or sub- Saharan Africa, where the HIV epidemic is most severe. Basic epidemiological research on transwomen in these regions is overdue. We therefore also propose a cross-sectional survey of 250 transwomen in Nanjing, China and a formative assessment of transwomen in Windhoek, Namibia. In addition to obtaining the first estimates of HIV prevalence among transwomen in China and the first focused study of transwomen in sub-Saharan Africa, we will prepare these sites for future inclusion in the cohort. Our specific aims for the current proposal are: 1) to establish a population-based cohort of transwomen in San Francisco and São Paulo to measure HIV incidence; 2) to test hypotheses on social and biomedical gender transition events as causal factors in HIV acquisition among transwomen; 3) to initiate HIV prevention research for transwomen in China and sub-Saharan Africa. We will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS) for recruitment in order to approximate population-based samples for high external validity. Social media and mobile and web-based technologies will be used to increase cohort retention for high internal validity. HIV is only one health disparity experienced by transwomen. Transwomen are at increased risk for multiple mental health disorders and little is known about the impact of gender transition procedures on non-communicable diseases. The project will culminate in an international collaborative for rigorous HIV prevention research with incident endpoints and an infrastructure for ancillary studies on transwomen health issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Transnational Cohort: global HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen PROJECT NARATIVE The proposed study progressively builds an international platform for HIV prevention and health research for transwomen, including a longitudinal cohort in San Francisco, USA and São Paulo, Brazil, a cross-sectional survey in Nanjing, China, and formative investigation in Windhoek, Namibia. The longitudinal study will measure HIV incidence and identify causes of HIV acquisition. The studies in China and sub-Saharan Africa will provide basic epidemiological data and build capacity for future transwomen health research.

"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Morehouse School of Medicine Prevention Research Center (MSM PRC) seeks continued funding through the 2014-2019 period. MSM PRC conducts interdisciplinary community-based prevention research in African American and other minority communities; trains minority community-based researchers and public health practitioners; and demonstrates the value of community coalitions in conducting research. MSM PRC is governed by a Community Coalition Board (CCB) that represents a partnership between the City of Atlanta's Neighborhood Planning Units T, V, X, Y and Z, three academic institutions and seven agencies (inclusive of state and local health departments). The CCB serves as a governing body with the majority being comprised of community residents and its Chair is always a community representative. Our research addresses priorities set by the CCB and the leading causes of health disparities and health problems in their communities.  The proposed core intervention research project seeks to expand MSM PRC's research scope and focus on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI's) among adolescents ages 14-18. The research to be undertaken is designed to address gaps in the efficacy and effectiveness literature related to HIV and STI prevention among African American youth. This research will address gender differences, the efficacy of a multi-component intervention vs. a single component intervention, and the efficacy of including parents in the intervention.  We propose a health promotion research intervention that will reach youth at local Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA's and community organizations using social media in a major social marketing campaign. The research will compare the effectiveness of four aims. Aim #1 will use the ""Be a Responsible Teen"" intervention; Aim #2 will include a social marketing intervention and a parental component; Aim #3 will be based on the HIV-RAAP intervention and will incorporate media literacy; and Aim #4 will constitute a comparison group. Ecological, Social Cognitive, and Cultivation theories and models will guide this research.               The Core HIV research project will address CDC's winnable battle on HIV and intends to impact public health by addressing the Healthy People (HP) 2020 HIV goal to prevent HIV infection and its related illness and death.

"Community Engagement to Enhance EBI Implementation in a Public Housing Community ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For HIV prevention efforts to be most effective they must reach populations most at risk, use efficacious interventions, and be deliverable in real-world settings. While many efficacious evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for HIV prevention currently exist, community-based organizations (CBOs) often have difficulties implementing them among those most likely to benefit, with fidelity, good effect, and sustainability. Structural factors related to poverty often hinder HIV prevention delivery in communities most in need of the programs. For CBOs to successfully prevent the transmission of HIV in high risk communities, strategies to overcome the challenges of implementation are needed. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) offers one approach to work with community members to pinpoint community resources, priorities, needs, and barriers to consider in implementation. This application explores these issues among an often under-recognized group at enormously increased risk of HIV: African American women in the US South. The South is disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, with incidence rising over the last decade, and the largest burden on African Americans and women. HIV burden in women has also grown the past 25 years from 8% to over 25% of US AIDS cases. While African American women are only 12% of US women, they comprise 64% of newly infected women. Compounding the great need represented by these disparities, in previous studies, African American women in North Carolina reported significant structural obstacles to accessing HIV prevention programs in their communities, such as lack of transportation and childcare, food insecurity, and competing demands and suggested that program delivery in or near public housing facilities may represent a feasible way to overcome some of these barriers in locations where many people at elevated risk of HIV are concentrated. In a unique, transdisciplinary collaboration between UNC, CAARE, and the Durham Housing Authority, the central objective of this application is to design a structurally-informed implementation program plan for sustainable HIV prevention in public housing developments, using the Real AIDS Prevention Program EBI for African American women, as a test-case model in three aims. We will 1) Engage a broad range of community stakeholders to participate in the design of study methods and adaptation of RAPP for women living in public housing developments in the southern US through CBPR methods; 2) Understand perceived community resources, needs, priorities, and obstacles to the implementation of HIV prevention programs, particularly RAPP, among DHA residents and DHA and CAARE staff; 3) Create a replicable program plan for implementing RAPP within southern housing authority developments and pilot-test the implementation plan within the DHA for fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability.If successful, our next step will be to test the implementation program plan more widely at multiple southern US sites in an R01 application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to identify effective methods for implementing evidence-based HIV prevention programs for African American women in real-world settings in the rural south. It represents a partnership between community based organizations and the academic center to use community-based participatory research approaches. The proposed project is highly relevant to public health because it will help further understanding of how to implement high-quality evidence-based HIV prevention interventions in vulnerable communities.",Community Engagement to Enhance EBI Implementation in a Public Housing Community,9117631,R34MH104081,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' North Carolina ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' Consult ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' authority ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R34,2016,228760,0.05364277699838051

"RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV, interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present, only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. Our team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect, reductions in stimulant use, improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count, and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed randomized controlled trial addresses a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM). By utilizing contingency management as the platform for the delivery of an innovative positive affect intervention, this research could identify the first efficacious integrative intervention for promoting long-term reductions in HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM.

"Seattle HIV/AIDS modeling for Prevention The goal of this project is to examine the feasibility of developing an HIV transmission model for use in local HIV prevention planning for heterosexuals. Advances in HIV treatment and prevention have changed the intervention policy landscape, and public health departments in the US are now tasked with determining which combination of treatment and prevention strategies will have the greatest impact. Epidemic modeling is a valuable resource for this type of comprehensive HIV prevention planning. However, these models are often parameterized with a combination of data from multiple populations. As a result they are not rooted in, or representative of, a local epidemic, even though treatment and prevention strategies are designed mostly at state and local levels in the U.S. This project seeks to bring the modeling closer to the decision making: to create robust, modifiable and accessible modeling tools for HIV transmission dynamics at the state and local level that will support HIV prevention planning activities. Seattle/King County is an ideal setting for this pilot project because it has a robust HIV treatment and prevention program, the Governor has set a goal of reducing incidence by 50% by 2020, there is a strong team of epidemic modelers at the University of Washington (UW), and there is long history of collaboration between the UW, the state (WA DoH), and Public Health Seattle King County (PHSKC). The UW and local health departments have a history of working together to design local prevention initiatives and the UW CFAR currently supports a collaborative project adapting a model of MSM HIV transmission dynamics from an Emory/UW/CDC project to Seattle and WA State. Building a similar model for heterosexual HIV prevention planning has been identified as a priority by the new Director of the Washington State Department of Health Infectious Disease Office, Claudia Catastini. Heterosexuals account for ~25% of HIV incidence in the U.S. and 10-15% in WA State, with significant disparities by race. Adapting the Atlanta MSM model to represent a heterosexual population is a non-trivial effort – both the model structure and the data sources are different. The purpose of this project is to conduct a thorough and systematic review the data that are locally available and to develop and validate a model prototype, working closely with our partners in the local and state Public Health departments. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a prototype stochastic network epidemic model for heterosexual populations, (2) Parameterize the model using local data and conduct a preliminary assessment of the validity of the simulations (3) Work with our public health partners to identify data gaps and opportunities for data collection. If this project demonstrates feasibility, it will establish the rationale for public health investments to collect additional data if necessary, and an R01 level proposal to build out the code for a full working model. This project seeks to develop a prototype HIV transmission model for heterosexuals in Seattle/King County and Washington State, and identify gaps in existing local data for parameterizing the model. The goal is to assess the feasibility of designing a model that can be used for local and state comprehensive HIV prevention planning purposes. All aspects of this project involve close collaboration with our local and state health departments in order to ensure that the models meet their programmatic needs and the data gaps we identify inform future data collection.",Seattle HIV/AIDS modeling for Prevention,9202791,R21AI124789,"['Accounting ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cataloging ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Persons ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Catalogs ', ' meetings ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' systematic review ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' network models ', ' prototype ', ' treatment strategy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2016,193125,0.06903406402198906
"Evaluation of TransLife Center: A Locally-Developed Combination Prevention Intervention for Transgender Women at High Risk of HIV Infection Combination interventions to reduce disparities in HIV infection for transgender women (TW) who have sex with men are sorely needed, as this population is one of the highest risk and most underserved groups in the United States. The goal of this proposed research project is to evaluate a locally developed and potentially effective intervention, the TransLife Center (TLC), which provides combination (i.e., biomedical, behavioral, social/structural) HIV prevention services to adult TW at high risk for HIV infection, in a culturally specific and highly accessible affirming environment. The TLC intervention directly addresses the structural barriers to health promotion among TW through a coordinated screening and service model, including direct access to services most needed and requested by TW: employment, housing, legal, and health services, following a social determinants of health conceptual model. To date there are no evidence-based HIV prevention interventions (EBIs) for TW listed in the CDC compendium of EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap through collaboration between Chicago House and Social Service Agency (Chicago House), a long-standing HIV/AIDS service provider and HIV prevention researchers who have been actively engaged in the development of HIV prevention interventions for TW. Our experience suggests that Chicago House's TLC intervention is feasible and acceptable to the target population, with over 200 HIV-uninfected TW participating in services over the past three years and evidence suggesting potential efficacy of the intervention for both sexual risk reduction and health promotion. We propose to test the TLC intervention in a single arm trial among 100 HIV-uninfected and sexually active TW, ages 18 and older, and evaluate intervention effectiveness over a 12-month period with visits at 6-month intervals (baseline, 6-months, 12-months). All participants will receive standard-of-care HIV/STI prevention and testing services, assessment and linkage to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as indicated. We will evaluate the TLC intervention via the following aims: AIM 1) To determine the pre-post efficacy of the TLC intervention on the primary outcome: number of condomless anal sex acts without protection by PrEP. 1a) To assess the dose response relationship between intervention exposure as well as exposure to specific components (i.e., employment, housing, legal, and health) on reductions in the primary outcome. 1b) To assess mediation of intervention effects on protective processes (gender affirmation, collective self-esteem, social support) theorized to increase with intervention exposure; AIM 2) To examine intervention implementation experiences through semi-structured interviews with 20 TLC participants and 10 Chicago House staff members. AIM 3) Exploratory Aims: 3a) To describe the trajectory of PrEP indication, uptake, retention and adherence in the community-based sample over a 12-month follow-up period and evaluate the impact of the TLC intervention on the PrEP continuum of care. 3b) To explore whether reductions in HIV risk are associated with epidemiologically-linked moderators including age and race/ethnicity.   Extremely high rates of HIV infection among transgender women (TW) and evidence that socioeconomic marginalization (e.g., unemployment, incarceration, homelessness) drives HIV-related risk indicate a need for comprehensive HIV prevention programs targeted to their unique circumstances. The goal of this proposed research project is to evaluate a locally developed and potentially effective intervention, Chicago House's TransLife Center (TLC), which provides combination (i.e., biomedical, behavioral, social/structural) HIV prevention and care services to adult transgender women at high risk for HIV infection, in a culturally specific and highly accessible affirming environment.

"Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men ABSTRACT From 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among MSM aged 13-24 years old more than doubled. There are stark racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections among YMSM; 13- 24 year old racial and ethnic minority MSM now represent a rapidly growing share of all new HIV infections. Although the likelihood of HIV acquisition is greater at older ages, many of the cognitive and behavioral risk factors that contribute to the risk of HIV infection rates develop in adolescence. As adolescent MSM (AMSM; 13-18 years old) begin to develop and express gender and sexual identities, to experiment and begin sexual behaviors, and to begin to establish a sense of self, there is the opportunity to parallel this period of growth with targeted, tailored interventions that equip AMSM with the life skills they need to reduce their vulnerability to HIV risk and to establish the life skills necessary to manage risk. We developed a mobile-friendly WebApp intervention focused on life skills training (iCON) across 16 topics, ranging from stigma and discrimination to sexual health, with links to local resources. In the proposed activities, we will adapt iCON for four U.S regions heavily impacted by HIV, and revise the content to include materials that are age-appropriate for 13 to 18 year- olds. Given the role that stigma and social isolation plays in the lives of many AMSM, we also propose to embed a peer-to-peer motivational interviewing component to iCON, allowing participants to access motivational interviewing counseling via VSee video-chat. With a large and diverse sample (n=500), we will test the efficacy of the intervention, now referred to as iCON+, on cognitive and behavioral HIV-related outcomes using a two-arm randomized control design. In addition, we examine whether structural characteristics in a region (e.g., race/ethnicity segregation, HIV prevalence) influence the efficacy of the proposed intervention. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Adapt a multilevel, online life skills intervention (iCON+) to address HIV vulnerability among AMSM living in four heavily impacted regions constituting diverse racial/ethnic and geographic areas (Chicago-Detroit; Atlanta-Washington, DC; Memphis- New Orleans; San Francisco-San Diego) in the US. (2) Test the efficacy of iCON+, as compared to a delayed intervention condition, to improve cognitive (e.g., comfort discussing sexuality; HIV prevention attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, behavioral intentions) and behavioral (e.g., condom use, HIV testing, PrEP use) factors using a prospective RCT design. (3) Examine the differential efficacy of iCON+ in improving psychosocial mediators (e.g., personal competency) associated with our outcomes and (4) Examine how socio-ecological determinants at the individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, urbanity) and regional (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, HIV prevalence) level are associated with iCON+'s efficacy. PROJECT RELEVANCE Consistent with the National HIV/AIDS Prevention Plan's call to reduce new HIV infections by intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities where HIV is most heavily concentrated, we propose to deliver and test a life skills intervention targeting the key domains that fuel HIV disparities among adolescent MSM in the United States. This RCT will yield important information regarding the delivery of a developmentally-appropriate HIV prevention program that reaches racial/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse sample of AMSM across four regions in the United States.",Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men,9204446,U01MD011274,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Young Black MSM: Neighborhood and Network Determinants PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods, social and sexual networks, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence cross-sectionally and longitudinally among young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Chicago IL metropolitan statistical area (MSA) followed over two years. We will enroll 350 Black MSM in the proposed NIH-funded uConnect Neighborhoods and Networks Cohort Study to address the aims of the research. Eligibility requirements include: HIV-seronegative; self-report no restrictions to usual physical activity; no plans to move outside of Chicago IL MSA in the next two years; and willingness to complete a two-week GPS protocol at nine time-points over two years. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols we have used in our previous feasibility research projects, including studies among Black MSM. In this longitudinal study, three months after completing the initial 2-week GPS protocol, participants will carry the GPS device for an additional 2-weeks every three-months over the two-year study period—for a total of nine times. GPS activity space environment and social/sexual networks data at baseline could potentially influence PrEP outcomes over time. Also, multiple GPS measures and social/sexual networks (at different time points) can better capture the breadth of people’s exposure to neighborhood-level factors and dynamics in social/sexual networks. The proposed study will be the largest GPS study of HIV disparities in any MSM population and presents a remarkable opportunity to study environmental influences on HIV prevention. Findings from the proposed research will impact HIV prevention intervention activities. First, it will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increased community efforts to combat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender hate crime neighborhood rates through increased local police attention in high- crime locations may be an HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV health disparities. Second, from the GPS dataset we will know the travel patterns of Black MSM and therefore be able to identify optimal geographic locations for HIV prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions are seldom geographically targeted. Third, this research will facilitate the identification of geographic locations suitable for recruiting Black MSM in research studies, an improved method of venue- based sampling, in this understudied population. Fourth, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces changes or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. Changing risk environments would suggest that prevention requires significant dynamism and fluidity, as well as rapid change-detection feedback loops. Finally, our dynamic network analysis we propose will deepen understanding of the effects of social and sexual networks on HIV prevention behaviors and will improve network-based HIV prevention interventions.

"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, after the emergence of antiretroviral therapy but before the potential of treatment as prevention had been established. Since its inception, CIRA has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings,contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, focused on the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment and the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive and multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized implementation science and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs that will diversify and replenish the field of HIV research. Building on recent advances in HIV science, the Center will foster and support various research programs in strategic areas with emphasis on implementation/translation research and combination, multi-level approaches. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will create a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers focused on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence and New Haven, This unique initiative will complement ongoing efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the 12 largest metropolitan areas by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to smaller cities with high HIV prevalence. Our global research will also focus on advancing implementation science and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, particularly South Africa, Russia and China. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five Cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods, In keeping with our strategic foci, each Core will have a role in supporting implementation science and building capacity to conduct research in small urban centers with high HIV prevalence. Addressing law, policy and ethics issues related to the conduct of HIV research will also be integral to the work of CIRA and its Cores in the new project period. Core level and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation.        RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Advances in HIV science hold great promise yet there are formidable barriers to translating this knowledge into practice. HIV disparities, a,resurgence of HIV in young MSM, the rise of HIV co-morbid conditions, the  aging ofthe HIV population, and need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public  health.

"Mathematical models to inform effective home-use HIV testing strategies for MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first over-the-counter home-use HIV test in 2012. Public health departments have started to implement programs to increase their use; however, the potential impact of these tests on the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) is unknown. The aim of this research is to inform public health approaches to promote safe and effective home-use HIV testing strategies for diverse populations of MSM. Home-use HIV tests may reduce HIV incidence if used by MSM who would otherwise not test or if they increase rates of testing, diagnosis and treatment. However, home-use tests may increase transmission if men replace clinic-based tests with home-use tests because the relatively long window period of available tests can result in false-negative tests during acute infection when HIV-infected persons are most infectious. Home-use tests may also negatively impact the infected individual's health and pose a challenge for HIV prevention if men who test positive at home do not seek care and initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a timely manner. Men may use home-use tests with sex partners prior to sex to make decisions about whether and how to have sex [5]. Such point-of-sex testing may be beneficial if partners test more often and seroadapt based on more accurate information but may increase HIV risk if men forgo condoms based on incorrect information about serostatus. Using data from two different epidemiologic settings in the U.S., Seattle and Atlanta, we will use mathematical models to estimate how different strategies of home-use HIV testing at the individual and partnership levels affects HIV incidence. First, we will develop a se of parameters to represent novel and heterogeneous HIV testing strategies for MSM, and adapt, expand, and validate a stochastic network-based HIV transmission model to account for home-use testing strategies and seroadaptive behavior for MSM in Seattle, WA and Atlanta, GA. Second, we will use the models to identify the most effective individual home-use HIV testing strategies to increase awareness of HIV infection and reduce HIV incidence among MSM in the two settings. Third, we will predict the impact of home-use point-of-sex HIV testing strategies on dyadic-level awareness of HIV infection and HIV incidence among MSM in Seattle versus Atlanta. In this proposal, our models are akin to a virtual laboratory: a practical and cost-effective way to examine the scenarios under which home-use testing can effectively reduce HIV incidence in diverse high-risk populations. Moreover, our models can support the design of clinical trials to test the effectiveness of home-use HIV testing interventions if such an initiatie is warranted.

"Understanding Delayed Access to HIV Prevention Services among Black MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV AIDS remains a major health crisis among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). In a recent large-scale HIV seroprevalence survey, prevalence rates were highest among AA MSM (28%), compared to 16% among MSM of all other ethnicities. This is a health disparity that has been replicated in many different studies since the start of the AIDS epidemic. Given the scale of the HIV epidemic among AA MSM, we cannot prevent the ongoing spread of HIV in the United States until we find ways to field effective HIV prevention programs for AA MSM. Combination prevention approaches to HIV/AIDS offer considerable promise to achieve this goal by addressing some of the high risk contexts that increase transmission risk among AA MSM. However, our ability to design effective combination prevention approaches to lower HIV transmission risk among AA MSM depends on achieving a clear epidemiological understanding of both barriers and facilitators to HIV testing, receiving reactive test results for men who are HIV positive and timel access to medical care if HIV positive. Unfortunately, our ability to explain HIV testing and health care access behaviors among AA MSM is currently limited due to the difficulties of recruiting sufficiently large samples of AA MSM who are delaying access to HIV prevention and care services. These shortcomings hamper our ability to draw effective conclusions about targeted prevention efforts for AA MSM, including most fundamentally an informed evidence base upon which combination prevention strategies must be built. Syndemics theory, which examines the effects and interactions among multiple psychosocial health conditions (i.e. substance abuse, depression, violence victimization) associated with increased risks within marginalized and vulnerable populations provides an important theoretical framework to examining these behaviors, especially since it encompasses both vulnerabilities and resiliencies in high risk populations. This application proposes to address this situation by collecting data from a large scale sample of AA MSM (N=6000) to: 1. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of uptake of HIV testing among AA MSM 2. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of unknown HIV seropositivity among AA MSM 3. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of timely access to care among HIV+ AA MSM By partnering with well-established community groups to recruit large samples of vulnerable men, we will be in a position to characterize the barriers and facilitators to the essential buildig blocks of combination prevention approaches and so provide crucial information for developing effective programs to lower HIV transmission among AA MSM.

"Race-related Social Contextual Factors, Substance Use, and HIV ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are more likely to contract HIV than White MSM. Research thus far has been unable to account for the mechanisms driving this racial disparity, as HIV research has largely targeted individual risk factors, but Black MSM consistently report comparable or fewer of these behaviors than other MSM. In addition, little research examining racial disparities acknowledges that substance use and other HIV risk behaviors are socially and spatially dependent; thus, differences in network and venue affiliation may shape the risk environments and behaviors of YMSM of different racial groups, and may be key in understanding differences in HIV. Emerging research with Black MSM documents racial differences in the network, venue, and neighborhood affiliations of YMSM. These findings suggest that although rates of drug use and other HIV risk behaviors may be lower among Black YMSM than other racial groups, their consequences may be different due to the nature of the risk environments experienced by these young men. The overall objective of this project is to contribute to knowledge about structural mechanisms (e.g., stigma and discrimination) that shape these risk environments, which in turn shape consequences of substance use and other HIV risk behaviors for young Black MSM. However, appropriately interpreting the empirical data describing these social and cultural contexts (i.e., the structure of social, sex, drug, venue, and neighborhood affiliation networks) i problematic without the incorporation of the voices, lived experiences, and knowledge of participants. Therefore, the innovative mixed methods approach proposed by this project will guide the interpretation of network-level structures captured within an existing NIH-funded cohort of YMSM. Three phases will occur in which network and geographic data is visualized (Phase 1) and used to guide interviews with YMSM, leading to a theory of mechanisms and functions in this population (Phase 2), which will be subsequently tested using multilevel modeling (Phase 3). The overall project has two aims: 1) identify how networks, venues, and neighborhoods operate as risk environments that shape the consequences of substance use and HIV risk behavior for YMSM of different racial groups, and 2) identify how structural mechanisms, such as stigma and discrimination, influence the networks, venue attendance, and neighborhood affiliations of YMSM of different racial groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young Black men who have sex with men (YMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS despite having lower rates of important individual risk factors, and the mechanisms driving these racial disparities are unknown. This application aims to examine (1) how networks, venues, and neighborhoods function as risk environments that shape the consequences of risk behaviors, such as drug use, for YMSM of different racial groups as well as (2) structural mechanisms that shape racial differences in risk environments. The project incorporates the voices and lived experiences of YMSM to deepen understanding of social contextual factors associated with HIV and drug use, which has the potential to further our understanding of these important mechanisms as well as to provide a platform for the development of multilevel HIV/STI risk reduction interventions.        ","Race-related Social Contextual Factors, Substance Use, and HIV",9063844,F31DA040524,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Life Experience ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Sexuality ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Agreement ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' YMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' illicit drug use ', ' ']",NIDA,DE PAUL UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.03241236723279134
"Facilitating Integration of HIV Prevention Strategies in Underserved Populations Through an mHealth Intervention ABSTRACT Each year there are at least 50,000 new HIV infections in the United States. African Americans, who make up only 12 percent of the U.S. population, make up 44 percent of the HIV-positive population.[1] Latinos face three times the HIV infection rates as whites.[2] This circumstance occurs in an era of highly effective and tolerable treatment regimens for HIV that improve health, prevent premature death, and have the ability to halt transmission. Yet, the burden of the illness continues to be disproportionately borne by minority and other health disparity populations. The knowledge and tools to prevent and treat HIV infection exist; yet, providers and patients do not have the necessary science and treatment knowledge to fully leverage the advances in HIV prevention, treatment, and care. Our proposed mobile health intervention has the potential to change the course of HIV prevention and treatment efforts in the U.S. by creating a mechanism for initiating and enhancing the provider-patient dialogue around HIV science and treatment. The proposed project has two specific aims with defined milestones to ensure appropriate evaluation and timely completion of the project. Aim 1 is focused on Prototype Development, including content development, and will be guided by a Project Advisory Panel of experts in HIV prevention and treatment research and clinical care. Aim 2 involves Feasibility Testing and Refinement of the prototype based on end user input. The formative research in this Phase 1 SBIR will provide critical information to guide the design of a commercially viable provider-patient communication channel that could surmount health literacy barriers and result in more rapid diffusion of HIV prevention efforts into the healthcare system. Primary care provider participants, not limited to physicians, and patient participants will be recruited from clinics within a community-based health center serving a large, residentially segregated, minority population.[3] The proposed intervention is innovative in both function and design and builds on the growing precedent of using electronic interfaces in clinic waiting rooms to complete either general or topical questionnaires. The application is unique in that it promotes provider-patient HIV literacy by creating a channel for the provider and patient to have an open, frank dialogue about the patient’s HIV risk using current evidence-based recommendations and data collected in real-time in a primary care setting. This approach is designed to maximize the impact of prevention efforts, particularly for those most at risk for HIV infection—communities of color, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and medically underserved populations. Project Narrative  The formative research in this Phase 1 SBIR will provide critical information to guide the design of a provider-patient communication channel that could improve HIV science and treatment knowledge of primary care providers and their patients through an mHealth intervention. The envisioned application would address many of the longstanding challenges that have thwarted advancement in HIV prevention and treatment in health disparity populations, including HIV-related stigma, and leverages the increasing use of mobile technology-based interventions in public health. Such an approach could maximize the impact of prevention efforts, particularly for those most at risk for HIV infection—communities of color, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and medically underserved populations.",Facilitating Integration of HIV Prevention Strategies in Underserved Populations Through an mHealth Intervention,9312504,R43MD012222,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

This application aims to examine (1) how networks, venues, and neighborhoods function as risk environments that shape the consequences of risk behaviors, such as drug use, for YMSM of different racial groups as well as (2) structural mechanisms that shape racial differences in risk environments. The project incorporates the voices and lived experiences of YMSM to deepen understanding of social contextual factors associated with HIV and drug use, which has the potential to further our understanding of these important mechanisms as well as to provide a platform for the development of multilevel HIV/STI risk reduction interventions.        ","Race-related Social Contextual Factors, Substance Use, and HIV",9249393,F31DA040524,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Socialization ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Agreement ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' illicit drug use ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIDA,DE PAUL UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.03241236723279134
"Syndemics and resilience for HIV transmission in a national sample of vulnerable DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gay and bisexual men (GBM) and other men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 63% of all new HIV diagnoses in 2010 -they are among the only population in which infections are actually rising. The syndemics model has been applied to MSM finding considerable empirical support for a model in which several specific co-occurring psychosocial health problems (e.g., depression, substance use, trauma from childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence) compound risk for HIV. Yet this model does not account for resilience in the face of syndemic factors-there are GBM who experience syndemics and yet do not engage in hazardous (i.e., HIV risk) behavior. Yet, resilience too is not well understood among GBM. The proposed study builds from the syndemics framework by investigating patterns of resilience in a national US sample of GBM. We have partnered with Harris Interactive, Inc., a research firm that maintains the largest and most comprehensive database of GBM, to identify a national sample of 1,000 GBM to participate in a 3- year longitudinal study (Baseline, 12-, 24-, 36-months) investigating patterns and correlates of syndemic, protective, and resilient factors. We propose to collect behavioral and biological outcomes (at-home HIV and STI testing). We will: (1) Determine patterns and prevalence of syndemic factors and risk behavior in a national sample of GBM; (2) Conduct qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants to identify new/unmeasured mechanisms of resilience and to contextualize our quantitative data (Baseline and 36- months); and (3) Longitudinally track trajectories in resilience, syndemics, and HIV and STI incidence to identify psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with these changing trajectories. Our methodological design-including the use of a national sample, longitudinal assessments, biological testing for HIV and STIs-enhances this study's external validity and thus the impact of our findings. And by tracking patterns in syndemics and resilience, this study will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs. Our application addresses an important problem and barrier to progress in the field (a strengths-based approach to HIV prevention among GBM that goes above and beyond general protective factors to examine resilient factors among men with high risk for hazardous behavior). It has potential to improve scientific knowledge regarding HIV prevention efforts with GBM. And understanding resilience in the face of syndemics can change the conceptual approach, treatments, services, and interventions for a population that remains in critical need. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay and bisexual men are disproportionally impacted by HIV and STIs. Our investigation of factors that are associated with resilience, HIV risk behavior, and HIV/STI incidence over time will inform (1) the development of the next generation of HIV prevention methods and (2) potential ways to improve established CDC DEBIs. By design, our findings will be generalizable such to inform HIV prevention for gay and bisexual men on a national scale.",Syndemics and resilience for HIV transmission in a national sample of vulnerable,9246514,R01DA036466,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vacuum ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Gays ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' service intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' ']",NIDA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2017,649411,0.03274153692465971
"Transwomen Connected, a mobile app delivered HIV prevention program ABSTRACT Transwomen Connected: a mobile app delivered HIV prevention program During the past two decades, the HIV epidemic has severely impacted transgender women in the U.S. Analysis of 2013 national HIV testing data found that transgender persons have the highest HIV incidence of any risk group, and discrepancies between self-reported prevalence and HIV testing data indicate that many HIV-infected transgender women are not aware of their HIV status. Other public health conditions among transgender women include discrimination-based physical and verbal abuse, poor mental health, alcohol and drug use, and unmet health care needs resulting from limited healthcare access and negative healthcare encounters. These co- occurring problems additively increase sexual risk for transgender women. Despite these health disparities and health-care access barriers, the U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that HIV prevention efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal. In particular, there are no transgender-specific, evidence- based programs that address the unique prevention needs of transgender women, leaving practitioners to implement programs designed for men who have sex with men (MSM) or cisgender women, even though transgender women's experiences of gender abuse, gender transition, transactional sex and violence distinguish them from most MSM and cisgender women. This project will address these gaps and fill an important product niche by testing the feasibility of creating Transwomen Connected: A Sexual Health Promotion Mobile App designed to engage transgender women through a strengths-based approach to HIV prevention and sexual health that uses the power of social networks to identify and encourage protective factors that support the health and well-being of transgender women. The mobile delivered intervention will expand the HIV prevention opportunities for transgender women by (1) providing organizations a cost-effective and easily implementable intervention option that is specifically designed for transgender women; (2) not requiring participants to attend multiple face-to-face sessions in a physical location and instead support iterative intervention implementation at any time or place; (3) permit transgender women to anonymously view the program on their phone in private settings; and (4) offer practitioners and agencies with low levels of technological infrastructure an effective means to connect with clients via mobile technology. The Phase I project, guided by an expert panel of transgender women of color, will produce: extensive formative research; a complete curriculum outline developed using a holistic, sexual harm reduction and life skills framework based on Social Cognitive Theory, gender affirmation, social support, and resilience; a prototype mobile app with complete app design, architecture, and three activities; and a usability evaluation to determine usability, appeal, and impact on knowledge and attitudes. Phase II will complete development and conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE During the past two decades, the HIV epidemic has severely impacted transgender women in the United States. Transgender persons have the highest HIV incidence of any risk group, and discrepancies between self-reported prevalence and HIV testing data indicate that many HIV-infected transgender women are not aware of their HIV status. The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that transgender persons are at high risk for HIV infection and yet efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal. To date there are no evidence- based HIV prevention programs that have been developed for and evaluated with this population. To fill this unmet need this project will develop a mobile app delivered multimedia interactive HIV prevention and sexual health promotion program developed for transgender women that delivers the intervention as a series of interactive activities tailored to the user. All activities will include gender affirmation and opportunities for social support. When complete, the resulting product will provide a cost effective HIV/STI intervention that can be implemented with transgender women across diverse settings with fidelity, while increasing uptake and effective delivery by appealing to the target audience on their mobile device and ultimately reducing new HIV/STI infections among transgender women.","Transwomen Connected, a mobile app delivered

"The Transnational Cohort: global HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transwomen bear a disproportionate burden of HIV worldwide, yet incidence is seldom measured and the determinants of acquiring infection are unknown. There is no HIV prevention intervention for transwomen with evidence of efficacy. Our project's goals are to create an international platform for HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen, obtain benchmarks for HIV incidence, and characterize causal factors for infection. We propose a cohort study of 1,100 transwomen in San Francisco, USA and São Paulo, Brazil where capacities are ready for longitudinal research. The cohort will measure HIV incidence and test hypotheses on HIV acquisition related to social and biomedical gender transition events and components of the Gender Affirmation, Behavioral Ecological, and Minority Stress models. Meanwhile, little is known about transwomen in China, the world's largest country, or sub- Saharan Africa, where the HIV epidemic is most severe. Basic epidemiological research on transwomen in these regions is overdue. We therefore also propose a cross-sectional survey of 250 transwomen in Nanjing, China and a formative assessment of transwomen in Windhoek, Namibia. In addition to obtaining the first estimates of HIV prevalence among transwomen in China and the first focused study of transwomen in sub-Saharan Africa, we will prepare these sites for future inclusion in the cohort. Our specific aims for the current proposal are: 1) to establish a population-based cohort of transwomen in San Francisco and São Paulo to measure HIV incidence; 2) to test hypotheses on social and biomedical gender transition events as causal factors in HIV acquisition among transwomen; 3) to initiate HIV prevention research for transwomen in China and sub-Saharan Africa. We will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS) for recruitment in order to approximate population-based samples for high external validity. Social media and mobile and web-based technologies will be used to increase cohort retention for high internal validity. HIV is only one health disparity experienced by transwomen. Transwomen are at increased risk for multiple mental health disorders and little is known about the impact of gender transition procedures on non-communicable diseases. The project will culminate in an international collaborative for rigorous HIV prevention research with incident endpoints and an infrastructure for ancillary studies on transwomen health issues.

Consistent with previous research conducted in the Jackson, MS MSA, including the NIH-funded Jackson Heart Study, participants will be recruited from urban and rural areas of counties that make up the Jackson, MS MSA. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols we have used in our previous feasibility research projects. Of the 150 participants, fifty participants will be randomized to undergo two rounds of 2-week GPS protocol: at baseline, and after a 3-month follow-up period. Obtaining GPS data over time will enable us to understand the extent of spatial overlap in people's spatial patterns over time, which may vary in part due to seasonal variation. Findings from the proposed research will impact drug use and HIV prevention intervention activities. First, this research will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increasing community efforts to combat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender hate crime neighborhood rates through increased local police attention in high-crime locations may be an HIV prevention intervention. Second, given that we will know the travel patterns of Black MSM, we will be able to identify optimal geographic locations for drug use and HIV testing/prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions ar seldom geographically targeted. Third, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time (3-month follow-up) will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces change or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. If these risk environments change, this suggests that prevention needs to be very dynamic and fluid and perhaps need rapid change-detection feedback loops. Finally, this research will also facilitate the identification of geographic locations suitable for recruiting Blck MSM in research studies (an improved method of venue- based sampling), in this understudied group. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between GPS-defined activity space neighborhoods, drug use and HIV risk among Black MSM in the Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan statistical area (MSA), a population in the United States heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS.","Activity Space Neighborhoods, Drug Use and HIV among Black MSM in the

"A Multilevel Network Model of Drug Use and HIV Racial Disparities in Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are disproportionately affected by HIV, with an annual incidence higher than any other age or race group. Despite this increasing epidemic, few studies have focused on MSM nor accounted for these disparities. The research that has examined disparities in MSM has been focused on understanding individual-level behavior, but this has been inadequate to explain HIV racial disparities. Additionally, network research is increasingly a priority area in HIV research due to the disease's high transmission dependence on drug and sexual network dynamics. However, network descriptions alone are also inadequate without considering the interplay of individual and contextual factors. Instead, it has been suggested that a broader systems-level perspective may be necessary as several interacting individual, network, and contextual differences may account for the increased epidemic in Black MSM populations. Due to this call for a systems-level perspective in understanding and preventing HIV infection, this grant seeks to advance understandings of HIV racial disparities in MSM by examining individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors within a multilevel network model. This model will be tested within an exceptional U01 NIDA-funded cohort of 1,200 diverse Chicago YMSM (PI: Primary Mentor Mustanski), which is collecting original multilevel (biologic, individual, dyadic, network) data. Utilizing methods developed within the applicant's R03 Project, YMSM will complete social (social, sexual, drug) and contextual (neighborhood & venue) network interviews. Building the study into the U01 cohort allows the current project to benefit from the strong infrastructure and resources of the U01, fortifies this project's feasibility, and provides unique opportunities to expand the aims of the U01. Data from this comprehensive longitudinal multilevel dataset will be used to build and validate a model of social contextual influences on racial disparities in HIV through innovative analyses and methods that account for the complex dynamics of HIV transmission and racial disparities. The overall project has two aims: 1) Identify social contextua factors (i.e., social relational and social contextual) which contribute to racial disparities in HV and 2) Examine the interplay of individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors in racial disparities in HIV. Additional sub- aims include: A) Compare the contribution of each level of analysis to racial disparities in HIV using innovative Multiple-Membership Multiple-Classification Models (MMMC) and B) Understand and validate the relations of individual, sexual network, and social contextual structures and attributes to racial disparities in HIV with ERGM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YMSM) have an alarming HIV/AIDS prevalence, yet the mechanisms driving these disparities are unknown. This proposal aims to examine social contextual influences on HIV disparities by building and validating a multilevel model and examining individual, network, and social contextual factors associated with HIV.",A Multilevel Network Model of Drug Use and HIV Racial Disparities in Men,9222000,K08DA037825,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Testing ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' model building ', ' ']",NIDA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2017,175527,0.03665592128056634
"Sexual Networks and HIV Transmission Clusters among Substance Using MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Heather A. Pines with the training and experience needed to facilitate her transition toward research independence in HIV prevention science. Dr. Pines' career development plan is designed to augment her training in epidemiology and allow her to: 1) develop expertise in social network analysis, 2) acquire skills in the use of genetic sequence analysis methods to identify HIV transmission clusters (i.e., individuals with genetically related HIV infections), 3) obtain further training in the ethical conduct of research, and 4) build the sklls necessary for a successful academic career. These training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, hands-on research, and mentoring from an interdisciplinary team of experts. Global disparities in resource allocation to HIV prevention services may limit the promise of recent breakthroughs in HIV prevention science, particularly among vulnerable substance using populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Innovative research that integrates social network and genetic sequence analysis methods to direct the delivery of biomedical HIV prevention strategies to individuals at greatest risk may help maximize their impact, control costs, and facilitate their implementation in the context of limited prevention resources. To this end, the overall objective of Dr. Pines' research project is to inform the development of comprehensive HIV prevention programs that leverage information on sexual network characteristics to interrupt HIV transmission among MSM in LMIC. The project will be embedded in a NIDA study among MSM in Tijuana, Mexico (R01DA037811; PI: Patterson), to capitalize on its research infrastructure and the expertise of its bi-national collaborators, and provide Dr. Pines with the opportunity to apply her newly acquired skills in social network and genetic sequence analysis. Pilot data suggest elevated rates of substance use and associated sexual risk behaviors may be driving the HIV epidemic among MSM in Tijuana. Thus, understanding the impact of substance use on sexual network characteristics and HIV transmission dynamics among MSM will be a major focus of this research. Specifically, the project aims to: 1) examine the influence of mean degree (number of male anal intercourse partners), the degree distribution, and sexual mixing patterns on overall sexual network structure among MSM; 2) identify individual, sexual network compositional, and socio-contextual factors associated with degree; and 3) determine whether sexual mixing patterns are associated with HIV transmission cluster membership. Findings from this project will be critical to Dr. Pines' development of an R01 proposal that integrates epidemiologic, social network, and genetic sequence analysis methods to advance HIV prevention science. These training and research activities will position Dr. Pines as the only researcher in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego with this unique skill set and enable her to develop an independent research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in HIV prevention science could significantly reduce HIV incidence worldwide.1 However, their promise may be limited among men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where HIV prevention resources for MSM populations are limited.2 The proposed training and research activities will enable the candidate to apply interdisciplinary research methods to investigate MSM sexual networks in Tijuana, Mexico in order to direct the delivery of scarce prevention resources and support the development of cost-effective, sexual network-based HIV prevention strategies for MSM in LMIC.",Sexual Networks and HIV Transmission Clusters among Substance Using MSM,9298615,K01DA040543,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+

"Structural Stigma and HIV Prevention Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. At current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Extant research has largely focused on identifying individual- and interpersonal-level risk factors for HIV infection among GBM; however, accumulating evidence also points to structural determinants of HIV outcomes in this population. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that structural stigma—defined as societal- level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the resources and opportunities of stigmatized individuals—is associated with adverse health outcomes, including HIV risk, among GBM. For example, pilot data from our research group showed that 4,098 GBM living in states with high levels of structural stigma—measured with a composite index of discriminatory state laws and negative social attitudes towards homosexuality—had lower levels of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge and use, lower odds of HIV testing, and greater odds of condomless anal sex compared with those living in low structural stigma states. While promising, the few existing studies of structural stigma and HIV outcomes among GBM have been limited by a reliance on cross-sectional designs, a small number of structural covariates, little attention to mediators/moderators of the structural stigma-HIV risk association, and non-probability samples of GBM. To address these limitations, we will create a new, prospective, nationally representative study of HIV-uninfected/unknown status GBM who will be followed for 5 waves of data collection over a 24-month period (N=500). With a representative sample of participants from across the U.S., we will have substantial variation in the social context surrounding GBM. This will be the first and largest prospective study with a nationally representative sample of GBM specifically designed to: (1) examine whether structural forms of stigma related to sexual identity increase vulnerability to adverse HIV prevention outcomes (e.g., less HIV testing and PEP/PrEP use); (2) identify mutable mechanisms (e.g., self-stigma, depressive symptoms, safer-sex self efficacy) through which structural stigma influences HIV outcomes; and (3) evaluate resilience processes (e.g., LGB community connectedness) that may mitigate the negative effects of structural stigma on HIV outcomes. In the final phase of the project, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 key informants and 30 GBM. We will use data from these interviews, together with the quantitative results, to inform the development of multi-level HIV intervention strategies that are maximally responsive to the structural conditions in which GBM are embedded. We have assembled a team of experts in structural stigma, HIV prevention among GBM, qualitative research, and survey research with nationally representative samples to address our study aims. This project stands to make important contributions to research on reducing disparities in the incidence of HIV infections among GBM, identified as a high NIH HIV/AIDS research priority. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the United States; further, recent estimates suggest that at current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Research into the underlying factors that can explain this risk—especially at the structural level, which has been relatively understudied—constitutes a critical area for public health. The goal of this proposed research is to evaluate structural determinants of HIV prevention outcomes among a nationally representative cohort of GBM, which will provide essential information that can be used to inform the development of effective HIV preventive strategies that address the social conditions surrounding the general population of GBM.",Structural Stigma and HIV Prevention Outcomes,9410775,R01MH112384,"['designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' secondary outcome ', ' family support ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Services ', ' Safe Sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,622919,0.04717313603330204
"Engaging African American and Latino MSM for HIV Testing and Prevention Services through Technology Abstract Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a key risk group in the United States and are disproportionately impacted in terms of HIV prevalence. The disparities experienced by MSM, and especially by Black and Hispanic MSM, are explicitly recognized in the National HIV AIDS Strategy, which calls for reducing disparities experienced by MSM, especially MSM of color. HIV testing is a key component of combination HIV prevention packages. Testing allows men to be aware of their HIV infection status and serves as a stepping stone to additional HIV prevention services, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. Increasing testing rates among Black and Hispanic MSM is a key component to reducing disparities among these groups. We propose a comparative effectiveness study to assess the effects of two innovative strategies that combine online recruitment and testing promotion strategies to increase HIV testing in Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM. The two innovative strategies will be compared to a traditional recruiting strategy and comaprison condition involving providing information about HIV testing and testing locations. The recruitment methods will be a social networking and dating app targeted to MSM (Grindr) and advertisements on gay-related websites; these recruiting strategies will be compared to a non-innovative strategy of targeted Facebook advertising. Innovative testing promotion strategies will be an app-based HIV prevention portal (HealthMindr) and a mobile-optimized website (healthMpowerment). Our primary aims are to conduct formative research to develop culturally appropriate innovative recruiting and testing promotion strategies, conduct a comparative effectiveness study to assess the effectiveness of each strategy in black and Hispanic MSM, and to develop a translation and dissemination plan to support uptake of the resulting intervention strategies in state and local health departments and community-based organizations. Narrative Black and Hispanic MSM are the most heavily impacted risk groups in the US HIV epidemic, but past studies have illustrated challenges with recruiting these men to uptake routine HIV testing. We propose a comparative effectiveness study to evaluate the relative performance of two strategies – each based on an innovative, established internet-based platform – to promote HIV testing among Black and Hispanic MSM.",Engaging African American and Latino MSM for HIV Testing and Prevention Services through Technology,9413847,U01PS005181,[''],NCHHSTP,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,849015,0.1626629573852693
"Efficacy of Couples-Based HIV Prevention in Vulnerable Young Men Project Summary Adolescent and young adult men who have sex with men (YMSM) are the only group in the U.S. in which rates of new HIV infections are increasing, which reflects a large disparity relative to heterosexuals. Steady or main partner relationships account for a substantial proportion of new HIV infections in YMSM. Among YMSM a serious relationship status is perhaps the strongest predictor of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), and pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be discontinued in a relationship. Romantic relationships also provide myriad benefits, including promotion of mental, behavioral, and physical health. Despite the critical importance of romantic relationship factors for HIV prevention, the vast majority of studies and interventions focus on individuals. We conducted formative research on coupled YMSM through an NIH R21 from which we developed an innovative couples-based intervention that addresses the continuum of HIV prevention and care for YMSM couples. The 2GETHER program integrates couples- and group-based modalities and is innovative in its design to address HIV transmission risk in couples regardless of serostatus; couples learn to utilize behavioral and biomedical approaches to prevent both HIV acquisition and transmission, with an overarching emphasis on improving relationship functioning. 2GETHER further encourages uptake of couples-based HIV testing for HIV-/unknown YMSM and medication adherence and engagement in care for HIV+ YMSM. We established feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of 2GETHER in a pilot trial of coupled YMSM (N=60 couples; 120 individuals), including significant decreases in HIV transmission risk behavior. Based on our highly successful pilot, we propose to test the efficacy of 2GETHER in large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will: (a) enroll racially diverse coupled YMSM; (b) randomize couples to either the 2GETHER intervention or attention-matched positive affect skills program for couples; (c) measure intervention outcomes through 12 months post-intervention. Analysis of study outcomes will utilize both individual- and dyadic-level data. Primary HIV risk behavioral outcome: an individual-level dichotomous variable indicating presence of CAI with a serodiscordant or unknown status partner. Exploratory analysis will calculate an innovative variable that accounts for the relative risk of sexual behaviors with partners of different serostatus, accounting for biomedical prevention. Primary biomedical outcome: Chlamydia/Gonnorhea incidence in individuals. Secondary dyadic-level HIV risk outcomes: concordance/discordance in relationship sexual agreement type and presence of agreement breaks. Secondary individual-level engagement in care outcomes: HIV testing uptake (HIV- men) and medication adherence (HIV+ men). In the context of increasing fatigue for HIV prevention, a healthy relationships program for coupled YMSM presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Further, in the era of treatment as prevention, we must develop transmission prevention strategies for MSM regardless of serostatus that address the full continuum of prevention and care. Project Narrative Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM), but YMSM report increasing fatigue with HIV prevention messages and strategies. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among YMSM by establishing the efficacy of an innovative, healthy relationship program for coupled YMSM (regardless of HIV status) that aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies, as well as primary and secondary prevention approaches.",Efficacy of Couples-Based

"Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the happy consequences of HAART is that HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals now have available to them medications that allow them to reach old age. This means that we have the previously unexpected challenge of finding ways to support healthy aging in communities with high HIV prevalence rates. This challenge is likely to be particularly difficult among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to not only their very high background HIV prevalence rates but also the general dearth of proven models to promote healthy aging among older MSM. To meet this challenge, we need to develop health promotion programs that are more potent than the efficacious but time-limited effects found among HIV prevention interventions. Thus, we need to identify mechanisms to raise levels of intervention efficacy to support healthy aging beyond those that have already been tapped to support other health promotion efforts among MSM. In previous research by our group, we documented that specific resiliencies among MSM appear to have robust health-promoting properties. Resiliencies research conducted among aging MSM is an innovative agenda on several counts. The dominant approach to explaining patterns of health among MSM has been to study the effects of deficits in creating health disparities. While an emphasis on deficits is useful in explaining the life course trajectories of men who have multiple psychosocial health problems that result in poor health outcomes, this focus is less helpful in explaining the trajectories of te far larger proportion of MSM who have also experienced cultural marginalization and yet remain healthy well into later life. This application proposes the following aims to test a theory-based approach to identifying both deficits and resiliencies among aging MSM over six waves of data collection (N=1850) using an ongoing cohort study.1)To measure changes in prevalence rates of psychosocial health problems and resiliencies over time; 2)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with changes in substance use and other psychosocial health problems and to test whether resiliencies moderate the pathway to syndemics; and 3)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with better HIV-related outcomes and biomarkers among HIV-positive MSM and to test if resiliencies moderate the impact of syndemics on these same outcomes. By identifying the resiliencies already used by some aging MSM to stay healthy but which have yet to be incorporated in current health promotion efforts for MSM, we can progress to the testing of potentially efficacious health promotion programs to support healthy aging among MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although many older men who have sex with men (MSM) exhibit significant strengths that have helped them remain healthy well into later life, these strategies have not been well documented. In particular, the strengths, or resiliencies, of older MSM have not been carefully studied in terms of their ability to support health as men age. This study will use a theory-based approach to follow aging MSM in six waves of an ongoing cohort study to document how resiliencies moderate the effects of health risks to better explain patterns of health and illness among aging MSM.",Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men,9308726,R01MD010680,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' violent partner ', ' partner violence ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' resilience ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older men ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' rate of change ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,588891,0.08162792676186323
"RCT of an integrative intervention for non-treatment-seeking meth users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), efforts are needed to identify evidence-based combination prevention approaches that achieve greater decreases HIV viral load among populations that are more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behavior. Because methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) are at greater risk for acquiring and transmitting medication-resistant strains of HIV, interventions targeting stimulant use in this population of high-risk men could boost the effectiveness of TasP. At present, only conditional cash transfer approaches such as contingency management (CM) have demonstrated short- term efficacy in reducing stimulant use among substance-using MSM who are not actively seeking formal treatment. The proposed RCT will examine the efficacy of a positive affect intervention that is designed to optimize the effectiveness of CM to achieve long-term reductions in stimulant use and HIV viral load in this population. Our team will examine the efficacy of this integrative intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 230 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM. After enrolling in CM, participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) the positive affect intervention; or 2) a attention-matched control condition. Follow-up data will be collected at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. This RCT will provide an opportunity to examine the efficacy of an integrative intervention designed to promote long-term reductions in HIV viral load as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes that will be examined include: increases positive affect, reductions in stimulant use, improvements in T-helper (CD4+) count, and decreases HIV transmission risk behavior. Identifying an efficacious intervention approach to decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy to reduce HIV incidence and mitigate HIV-related health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed randomized controlled trial addresses a critical public health issue facing men who have sex with men (MSM). By utilizing contingency management as the platform for the delivery of an innovative positive affect intervention, this research could identify the first efficacious integrative intervention for promoting long-term reductions in HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM.

"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Morehouse School of Medicine Prevention Research Center (MSM PRC) seeks continued funding through the 2014-2019 period. MSM PRC conducts interdisciplinary community-based prevention research in African American and other minority communities; trains minority community-based researchers and public health practitioners; and demonstrates the value of community coalitions in conducting research. MSM PRC is governed by a Community Coalition Board (CCB) that represents a partnership between the City of Atlanta's Neighborhood Planning Units T, V, X, Y and Z, three academic institutions and seven agencies (inclusive of state and local health departments). The CCB serves as a governing body with the majority being comprised of community residents and its Chair is always a community representative. Our research addresses priorities set by the CCB and the leading causes of health disparities and health problems in their communities.  The proposed core intervention research project seeks to expand MSM PRC's research scope and focus on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI's) among adolescents ages 14-18. The research to be undertaken is designed to address gaps in the efficacy and effectiveness literature related to HIV and STI prevention among African American youth. This research will address gender differences, the efficacy of a multi-component intervention vs. a single component intervention, and the efficacy of including parents in the intervention.  We propose a health promotion research intervention that will reach youth at local Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA's and community organizations using social media in a major social marketing campaign. The research will compare the effectiveness of four aims. Aim #1 will use the ""Be a Responsible Teen"" intervention; Aim #2 will include a social marketing intervention and a parental component; Aim #3 will be based on the HIV-RAAP intervention and will incorporate media literacy; and Aim #4 will constitute a comparison group.

"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, after the emergence of antiretroviral therapy but before the potential of treatment as prevention had been established. Since its inception, CIRA has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings,contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, focused on the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment and the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive and multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized implementation science and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs that will diversify and replenish the field of HIV research. Building on recent advances in HIV science, the Center will foster and support various research programs in strategic areas with emphasis on implementation/translation research and combination, multi-level approaches. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will create a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers focused on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence and New Haven, This unique initiative will complement ongoing efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the 12 largest metropolitan areas by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to smaller cities with high HIV prevalence. Our global research will also focus on advancing implementation science and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, particularly South Africa, Russia and China. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five Cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods, In keeping with our strategic foci, each Core will have a role in supporting implementation science and building capacity to conduct research in small urban centers with high HIV prevalence. Addressing law, policy and ethics issues related to the conduct of HIV research will also be integral to the work of CIRA and its Cores in the new project period. Core level and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation.        RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Advances in HIV science hold great promise yet there are formidable barriers to translating this knowledge into practice. HIV disparities, a,resurgence of HIV in young MSM, the rise of HIV co-morbid conditions, the  aging ofthe HIV population, and need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public  health.

"HIV intervention models for criminal justice involved substance-using Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such ""shocks"" lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations.

"Community Engagement to Enhance EBI Implementation in a Public Housing Community ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For HIV prevention efforts to be most effective they must reach populations most at risk, use efficacious interventions, and be deliverable in real-world settings. While many efficacious evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for HIV prevention currently exist, community-based organizations (CBOs) often have difficulties implementing them among those most likely to benefit, with fidelity, good effect, and sustainability. Structural factors related to poverty often hinder HIV prevention delivery in communities most in need of the programs. For CBOs to successfully prevent the transmission of HIV in high risk communities, strategies to overcome the challenges of implementation are needed. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) offers one approach to work with community members to pinpoint community resources, priorities, needs, and barriers to consider in implementation. This application explores these issues among an often under-recognized group at enormously increased risk of HIV: African American women in the US South. The South is disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, with incidence rising over the last decade, and the largest burden on African Americans and women. HIV burden in women has also grown the past 25 years from 8% to over 25% of US AIDS cases. While African American women are only 12% of US women, they comprise 64% of newly infected women. Compounding the great need represented by these disparities, in previous studies, African American women in North Carolina reported significant structural obstacles to accessing HIV prevention programs in their communities, such as lack of transportation and childcare, food insecurity, and competing demands and suggested that program delivery in or near public housing facilities may represent a feasible way to overcome some of these barriers in locations where many people at elevated risk of HIV are concentrated. In a unique, transdisciplinary collaboration between UNC, CAARE, and the Durham Housing Authority, the central objective of this application is to design a structurally-informed implementation program plan for sustainable HIV prevention in public housing developments, using the Real AIDS Prevention Program EBI for African American women, as a test-case model in three aims. We will 1) Engage a broad range of community stakeholders to participate in the design of study methods and adaptation of RAPP for women living in public housing developments in the southern US through CBPR methods; 2) Understand perceived community resources, needs, priorities, and obstacles to the implementation of HIV prevention programs, particularly RAPP, among DHA residents and DHA and CAARE staff; 3) Create a replicable program plan for implementing RAPP within southern housing authority developments and pilot-test the implementation plan within the DHA for fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability.If successful, our next step will be to test the implementation program plan more widely at multiple southern US sites in an R01 application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to identify effective methods for implementing evidence-based HIV prevention programs for African American women in real-world settings in the rural south. It represents a partnership between community based organizations and the academic center to use community-based participatory research approaches. The proposed project is highly relevant to public health because it will help further understanding of how to implement high-quality evidence-based HIV prevention interventions in vulnerable communities.",Community Engagement to Enhance EBI Implementation in a Public Housing Community,9281080,R34MH104081,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' North Carolina ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' Consult ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' authority ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Evidence based program ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R34,2017,222680,0.05364277699838051
"A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM Project Summary  Adolescent (ages 13-18) men who have sex with men (AMSM) experience a dramatic health disparity as they represent 2% of young people but account for almost 80% of HIV diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based HIV prevention programs. Implementation issues are critical as traditional HIV prevention delivery channels (community organizations, schools, parents), have significant limitations when it comes to AMSM. eHealth interventions represent an excellent modality for delivering AMSM-specific intervention material where youth “are.”  We should not continue to deliver the same intervention when a participant is not responding. Rather, stepped-care strategies increase in intensity to meet the needs of those who do not respond to a less intense intervention. Using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, we will evaluate the impact of a package of increasingly intensive interventions that have already shown evidence of efficacy with diverse adolescent and young adult MSM. The SMART design is an ideal approach to achieve the goals of this RFA because SMART designs mimic treatment decisions as they are made in real-world clinical settings. Collectively we brand our package of eHealth interventions as the SMART Program (Sexual Minority Adolescent Risk Taking). The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis. Public Health Relevance Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group among youth in the US and rates of infections are increasing, however, few HIV prevention programs have been developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve public health by establishing the effectiveness of an innovative, eHealth HIV prevention program for YMSM.",A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM,9322389,U01MD011281,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Magic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' community organizations ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' sexual minority ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' queer ', ' trial design ', ' adolescent men who have sex with men ', ' adolescent MSM ', ' AMSM ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2017,3291161,0.03355851604940887
"Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men ABSTRACT From 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among MSM aged 13-24 years old more than doubled. There are stark racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections among YMSM; 13- 24 year old racial and ethnic minority MSM now represent a rapidly growing share of all new HIV infections. Although the likelihood of HIV acquisition is greater at older ages, many of the cognitive and behavioral risk factors that contribute to the risk of HIV infection rates develop in adolescence. As adolescent MSM (AMSM; 13-18 years old) begin to develop and express gender and sexual identities, to experiment and begin sexual behaviors, and to begin to establish a sense of self, there is the opportunity to parallel this period of growth with targeted, tailored interventions that equip AMSM with the life skills they need to reduce their vulnerability to HIV risk and to establish the life skills necessary to manage risk. We developed a mobile-friendly WebApp intervention focused on life skills training (iCON) across 16 topics, ranging from stigma and discrimination to sexual health, with links to local resources. In the proposed activities, we will adapt iCON for four U.S regions heavily impacted by HIV, and revise the content to include materials that are age-appropriate for 13 to 18 year- olds. Given the role that stigma and social isolation plays in the lives of many AMSM, we also propose to embed a peer-to-peer motivational interviewing component to iCON, allowing participants to access motivational interviewing counseling via VSee video-chat. With a large and diverse sample (n=500), we will test the efficacy of the intervention, now referred to as iCON+, on cognitive and behavioral HIV-related outcomes using a two-arm randomized control design. In addition, we examine whether structural characteristics in a region (e.g., race/ethnicity segregation, HIV prevalence) influence the efficacy of the proposed intervention. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Adapt a multilevel, online life skills intervention (iCON+) to address HIV vulnerability among AMSM living in four heavily impacted regions constituting diverse racial/ethnic and geographic areas (Chicago-Detroit; Atlanta-Washington, DC; Memphis- New Orleans; San Francisco-San Diego) in the US. (2) Test the efficacy of iCON+, as compared to a delayed intervention condition, to improve cognitive (e.g., comfort discussing sexuality; HIV prevention attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, behavioral intentions) and behavioral (e.g., condom use, HIV testing, PrEP use) factors using a prospective RCT design. (3) Examine the differential efficacy of iCON+ in improving psychosocial mediators (e.g., personal competency) associated with our outcomes and (4) Examine how socio-ecological determinants at the individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, urbanity) and regional (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, HIV prevalence) level are associated with iCON+'s efficacy. PROJECT RELEVANCE Consistent with the National HIV/AIDS Prevention Plan's call to reduce new HIV infections by intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities where HIV is most heavily concentrated, we propose to deliver and test a life skills intervention targeting the key domains that fuel HIV disparities among adolescent MSM in the United States. This RCT will yield important information regarding the delivery of a developmentally-appropriate HIV prevention program that reaches racial/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse sample of AMSM across four regions in the United States.",Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men,9322370,U01MD011274,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', '

"HIV intervention models for criminal justice involved substance-using Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such ""shocks"" lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations.

The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis. Public Health Relevance Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group among youth in the US and rates of infections are increasing, however, few HIV prevention programs have been developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population.

"Seattle HIV/AIDS modeling for Prevention The goal of this project is to examine the feasibility of developing an HIV transmission model for use in local HIV prevention planning for heterosexuals. Advances in HIV treatment and prevention have changed the intervention policy landscape, and public health departments in the US are now tasked with determining which combination of treatment and prevention strategies will have the greatest impact. Epidemic modeling is a valuable resource for this type of comprehensive HIV prevention planning. However, these models are often parameterized with a combination of data from multiple populations. As a result they are not rooted in, or representative of, a local epidemic, even though treatment and prevention strategies are designed mostly at state and local levels in the U.S. This project seeks to bring the modeling closer to the decision making: to create robust, modifiable and accessible modeling tools for HIV transmission dynamics at the state and local level that will support HIV prevention planning activities. Seattle/King County is an ideal setting for this pilot project because it has a robust HIV treatment and prevention program, the Governor has set a goal of reducing incidence by 50% by 2020, there is a strong team of epidemic modelers at the University of Washington (UW), and there is long history of collaboration between the UW, the state (WA DoH), and Public Health Seattle King County (PHSKC). The UW and local health departments have a history of working together to design local prevention initiatives and the UW CFAR currently supports a collaborative project adapting a model of MSM HIV transmission dynamics from an Emory/UW/CDC project to Seattle and WA State. Building a similar model for heterosexual HIV prevention planning has been identified as a priority by the new Director of the Washington State Department of Health Infectious Disease Office, Claudia Catastini. Heterosexuals account for ~25% of HIV incidence in the U.S. and 10-15% in WA State, with significant disparities by race. Adapting the Atlanta MSM model to represent a heterosexual population is a non-trivial effort – both the model structure and the data sources are different. The purpose of this project is to conduct a thorough and systematic review the data that are locally available and to develop and validate a model prototype, working closely with our partners in the local and state Public Health departments. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a prototype stochastic network epidemic model for heterosexual populations, (2) Parameterize the model using local data and conduct a preliminary assessment of the validity of the simulations (3) Work with our public health partners to identify data gaps and opportunities for data collection. If this project demonstrates feasibility, it will establish the rationale for public health investments to collect additional data if necessary, and an R01 level proposal to build out the code for a full working model. This project seeks to develop a prototype HIV transmission model for heterosexuals in Seattle/King County and Washington State, and identify gaps in existing local data for parameterizing the model. The goal is to assess the feasibility of designing a model that can be used for local and state comprehensive HIV prevention planning purposes. All aspects of this project involve close collaboration with our local and state health departments in order to ensure that the models meet their programmatic needs and the data gaps we identify inform future data collection.",Seattle HIV/AIDS modeling for Prevention,9294929,R21AI124789,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Persons ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Catalogs ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' Community Health ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' systematic review ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' network models ', ' prototype ', ' treatment strategy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2017,231750,0.06903406402198906
"Center for AIDS Intervention Research Core Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes the renewal for 2014-2019 of the Center for AIDS Intervention Research (CAIR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin as an HIV behavioral research Center. CAIR's thematic mission is the conceptualization, conduct, and rigorous evaluation of interventions to prevent HIV infection in communities most vulnerable to the disease; the development of interventions to improve health outcomes among persons living with the disease; and the rapid dissemination of research findings to both the scientific community and public health service provides. The Center's Core structure supports the efforts of an interdisciplinary team of HIV prevention investigators, and CAIR has been highly productive and a strong regional, national, and international resource in the areas of research, training, and service to the scientific and public health communities. CAIR Investigators have made distinguished scientific contributions in the development of HIV prevention interventions for high-incidence populations in the United States, Eastern Europe, and other regions of the world; have advanced the field's scientific knowledge of how to transfer scientific advances to benefit service providers nationally and internationally; and have undertaken vigorous lines of behavioral and social science, methodological, and cost-effectiveness research applied to HIV prevention. CAIR's specific aims during the renewal period are: 1) the development of behavioral, social, and structural interventions that will lead to wide scale public health implementation of recently-emerging biomedical HIV prevention strategies; 2) establishing the effectiveness of multi-level HIV prevention interventions that combine potent behavioral, social, structural, and biomedical interventions to achieve greatest public health impact in reducing HIV incidence; 3) reducing HIV-related health disparities; and 4) serving as a resource that rapidly transforms scientific advances into sustainable public health practice. To support continued excellence in these areas, we propose a structure that brings together interdisciplinary teams and provides resources from the following Cores: Administration Core (Center strategic planning and oversight); Developmental Core (preliminary studies, internal peer review, Center conferences and professional development); Qualitative Core (qualitative and social science support); Quantitative Core (central data management, analysis, and biostatistical consultation); Intervention and Dissemination Core (intervention trial support and technology exchange initiatives); International Core (facilitating international initiatives); and Impact Science Core HIV prevention economic, modeling, and impact analyses).

"Multilevel Influences on HIV and Substance use in a YMSM Cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) ages 16-29 are disproportionately affected by HIV, with high prevalence and incidence. While all other risk groups have declining rates of infection, dramatic increases are occurring among YMSM. YMSM are understudied, but preliminary research demonstrates that the HIV epidemic in YMSM forms a syndemic with drug use, violence, and mental health problems. The proposed study will build a dynamic dyadic-network cohort of 1,358 YMSM by hybridizing 2 existing cohorts of YMSM: Project Q2 (aged 20-24) and ChiGuys (aged 16-17). We will expand this unified cohort through the enrollment of serious sexual partners of core participants, thereby creating a dynamic dyadic network. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply a ""next generation"" multilevel model (Network-Individual-Resources model) to understand the syndemic among a cohort of YMSM and inform ""high-impact"" HIV prevention with this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1 is to understand how syndemics of substance use, HIV, STIs, mental disorders, and violence develop among YMSM using an accelerated longitudinal design. We will assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood, to describe the trajectories of syndemic development (including substance use) and use innovative statistical modeling to characterize different trajectories of syndemic development to predict youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. Aim 2 is to determine how dyadic processes influence HIV risk behaviors and transmission among YMSM by enrolling their serious sexual partners into the cohort. We will utilize dyadic data to identify which sexual partner and relationship factors are longitudinally related to unprotected sex and HIV/STI transmission across development. Phylogenetic analyses will link HIV transmissions within dyads to determine what behavioral, partner and dyadic factors predict such transmission. Aim 3 is to describe network and structural influences on syndemic development among YMSM. We will examine how sexual and drug use network structure Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM). The objective of this proposal is to build a large and innovative dynamic dyadic-network cohort of YMSM and their serious sexual partners in order to delineate multilevel influences on HIV and substance use. This cohort will serve as a strong resource platform for a wide range of future innovative research efforts and will inform behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention interventions for YMSM.

"Center/Coordination, Analysis and Management/MACS This application is to renew the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a comprehensive quality-assured  prospective cohort study of over 7000 men, which has contributed almost 1300 research papers on the  natural history of HIV infection and the impact of effective combination antiretroviral therapies (cART). The  follow-up of the existing cohort with continuing dynamic enrollment will enable elucidation of long-term  effects of cART, including newer and evolving cART regimens, in men who have sex with men (MSM), the  largest population impacted by HIV in the U.S. The overarching goals of the MACS are to continue to  elucidate the biology of infection and the clinical outcomes of treated and untreated infection, combining  immunologic, virologic, genetic and psychosocial approaches. The scientific agenda of the MACS focuses on  four primary areas: 1) clinical epidemiology of HIV-related and non-AIDS-defining outcomes with particular  emphasis on the effects of cART and age; 2) pathogenic mechanisms underlying HIV susceptibility, disease  progression and treatment response including genetic and other molecular factors; 3) psychosocial factors,  including substance use which influence risk of HIV infection, co-morbidities and treatment utilization; and 4)  development of novel applied methodology. Following HIV-uninfected MSM with the same standardized  protocols will facilitate distinguishing the contributions of HIV, age, genetics,co-infections and behaviors on  the development of non-AIDS-defining outcomes including malignancies, and aging. The role of unresolved  inflammation and immune activation, and more rapid senescence of the immune system, on disease course  in treated HIV will be investigated. Data with linked specimens, particularly from over 700 HIV seroconverters,  provides an unparalleled resource for studying the entire natural history of HIV, ranging from pre-infection  (e.g. susceptibility) to infection, through treatment to old age and death. The MACS is and will  continue to be ideally positioned to address these issues because of its long-term standardized follow-up, an  extensive repository of over 1 million specimens that have been collected semiannually since 1984, an  appropriate control group of HIV- MSM, and a seasoned and expanding cadre of experienced investigators. In the US, the highest HIV incidence is among men who have sex with men (MSM), and with effective  treatment, the median age of HIV-infected persons is soon expected to be 50 years. The MACS is ideal for  elucidating biological and psychosocial effects of aging with HIV, and effects of evolving therapies on  biomarkers related to resulting outcomes. The proposed research will provide information for development of  vaccines for HIV as well as for the prevention of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining outcomes.","Center/Coordination, Analysis and

"Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men  The overarching goal of this proposed study is to leverage existing and ongoing data to examine the role of sexual behavior stigma on access to HIV healthcare as well as sexual and mental health outcomes among men who have sex with men (MSM). Worldwide MSM are a key population that bear a disproportionate burden of HIV with high prevalence and incidence yet they have low uptake and/or access to treatment and prevention. Consistent with NIH HIV/AIDS research priorities, the proposed project aims to reduce health disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes by addressing stigma towards MSM in the context of intersecting stigmas and potentially modifiable mediators (e.g., depression). In particular, validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed to effectively measure stigma-related interventions and to better understand the mechanisms of how stigma potentiates HIV risks among this key population. We propose to leverage existing data collected from over 15,000 MSM across 7 different Sub-Saharan African nations, the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS), the UCLA mSTUDY, and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 078 study on Enhancing Recruitment, Linkage to Care and Treatment for HIV-Infected MSM in the US. The specific aims of the work are: Aim 1) Develop validated measures used to assess sexual behavior stigma among MSM using factor analysis and validity and reliability testing. This will result in finalized stigma metrics and recommendations for integration of MSM stigma items that can be used in future studies. Aim 2) Identify specific mediated associations between stigma and HIV-related outcomes using structural equation modeling. In addition, test for intersectionality of multiple forms of stigma (e.g., gender, HIV status, race/ethnicity) using an inter- and intra-categorical approach. The delivered outcomes will include quantified associations of sexual behavior stigma with HIV-related outcomes that can be used to inform HIV intervention planning by setting feasible targets for stigma mitigation interventions. Aim 3) Include final validated stigma metrics in an upcoming cycle of AMIS and bio-validate the stigma metrics. Bio-validation will consist of testing associations of sexual behavior stigma with testing positive for sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia and gonorrhea), and with chronic stress measured using telomere DNA length. Participants will self-collect urine, rectal, and saliva specimens using home-based STI test kits. Overall, the proposed study will result in a thorough assessment of a sexual behavior stigma scale for MSM and how it operates comparatively with other types of stigma. The validated stigma metrics will provide recommendations for future studies that seek to measure stigma and its relation to HIV among this key population. The World Health Organization, UNAIDS, and the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy have collectively called for the need to reduce stigma towards MSM as a vital component of an effective HIV response. Consistent and validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed in the context of multiple intersecting stigmas; therefore, the proposed research project will develop, test, and validate sexual behavior stigma metrics using existing and ongoing data collected across Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. Using bio- specimens collected in the American Men's Internet Survey, the proposed project will additionally contribute to the understanding of relationships between stigma and risk for chronic stress and sexually transmitted infections among this key population.",Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men ,9270763,R01MH110358,"['Affect ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', '

"Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM Project Summary/Abstract Racial/ethnic disparities in HIV have been a hallmark of the US HIV epidemic for decades, with black/African Americans experiencing higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans. These disparities are also observed in men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom the highest incidence rates are in young black/African American MSM (YBAAMSM). Despite a rich literature demonstrating the prevalent levels of drug and alcohol use among MSM and the potential relationships between these substances and high-risk sexual behaviors, individual risk behaviors do not explain why black MSM and YBAAMSM are more likely to become infected with HIV, compared to other MSM. Studies of self-reported use have collectively demonstrated no greater substance use among black MSM than among white MSM. However, a key finding of our previous R01, which examined factors associated with prevalent and incident HIV infection among a prospective cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta, was that black MSM had substantially lower validity of self-reported drug use, compared to white MSM. Biomarker-classified drug use was also more predictive of HIV seroconversions than self-reported sexual behavior measures, suggesting that, in this population, substance use may be a marker of high-risk partners and environments. Furthermore, the racial disparity in prevalent HIV infection was most associated with differences in network and community factors rather than individual factors. Despite emerging data on sexual partners and structures among YBAAMSM, little is known about the overlap of sexual and substance-use networks, though this might amplify HIV/STI transmission risk. Therefore, we propose to conduct a new prospective cohort study of 300 HIV-negative YBAAMSM in Atlanta, GA, to understand prospective patterns of biomarker-supported substance use in YBAAMSM, as well as its antecedents, contexts, and consequences. This new project will build on the strong institutional infrastructure, community partnerships, theoretical frameworks, analytical approaches, and multidisciplinary research that contributed to the success of our previous cohort study. Results will provide a more detailed understanding of the multilevel associations between substance use and HIV risk, and will yield new opportunities for combination interventions that address the syndemics of HIV/STI and drug use among YBAAMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Profound disparities in HIV incidence exist for young black/African American MSM compared to other subgroups of MSM. Substance use is prevalent and associated with HIV infection for young black/African American MSM, but the mechanisms by which substances impart added HIV risk are unclear. A cohort study of HIV-negative black MSM ages 18-29 is proposed to further understanding of the relationships between substances and HIV/STI incidence and risk behaviors, and suggest possible interventions.",Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM,9271174,R01DA038196,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Cocaine ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pre-clinical Drug Evaluation ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Modality ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sentinel ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validity of Self Report ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' cocaine use ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' METH using ', ' METH use ', ' community partnership ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,638245,0.048950165357782495
"Intervention to increase access to PEP to prevent HIV infection among Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black MSM in the US are affected by HIV at severely disproportionate rates. A key component of HIV prevention for communities at risk is increasing access to and uptake of biomedical HIV prevention, including pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP). PEP is underutilized by those at risk for HIV acquisition after exposure, despite the fact that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued the first PEP guidelines over 15 years ago. Numerous barriers to successful PEP treatment exist along the ""PEP cascade"" for Black MSM. Research on the PEP cascade and barriers is sparse, with almost none focused solely on Black MSM. Increasing access to and uptake of PEP among Black MSM has the potential to reduce racial disparities in HIV incidence. To address this gap, we propose to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a multi- component intervention designed to increase awareness of, demand for, and access to PEP among Black MSM at high risk of HIV infection. The intervention has three components: 1) a social media campaign to increase demand for PEP among Black MSM; 2) a 24-hour helpline to link patients to timely clinical care; and 3) a PEP advocate intervention, modeled on peer health navigation, to ensure medication access and sustain engagement. The research will involve three phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct formative research to inform the media campaign and the PEP advocate intervention. In Phase 2, we will translate the results of the formative research into optimal messaging across relevant social and print media and standardize the PEP advocate intervention. In Phase 3, to assess impact of the media campaign, we will evaluate social media metrics and calls to the helpline. To assess the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary impact of the PEP advocate intervention, we will survey the first 50 eligible helpline callers and all patients accessing PEP at the clinical study site at 1-week and 3-months post exposure to describe the following outcomes: PEP uptake and completion, PEP care engagement, incident HIV and STIs, HIV testing, PrEP use, sexual risk behavior, select psychosocial factors and receipt of health services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New HIV infections among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 13 to 24 increased by 133% between 2001 and 2011 in the United States (US) and HIV disproportionately affects Black MSM; a recent study reporting a 5.9% annual HIV incidence among Black MSM (aged 18-30) in 6 US cities. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can prevent infection among Black MSM, but is underutilized. This study propose to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary impact of a multi-component intervention designed to increase awareness of, demand for, access to and uptake of PEP among Black MSM at high risk of HIV infection.

"Web-facilitated intervention for heavy drinking and HIV risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Annual rates of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States continue to grow rapidly, despite stability or decline among other groups. This trend highlights the ongoing importance of developing new tools to fight the continued expansion of the HIV epidemic among MSM. Although a number of sex risk reduction interventions exist for MSM, important limitations have restricted their impact. These include barriers to dissemination and/or implementation, such as lengthy treatment protocols, the need for highly- trained interventionists, and confining delivery only to healthcare settings. Interventions have also failed to address pivotal factors that lead to high-risk behavior specifically heavy drinking. Research testing the efficacy of interventions to reduce heavy drinking among MSM is scarce, and has mostly only explored lengthier treatment protocols that span several weeks or months. Single-exposure intervention approaches for reducing heavy drinking based on the principles of motivational interviewing (MI), commonly referred to as ""Personalized Feedback Interventions,"" have been developed and tested in other populations with success. Similar brief interventions for HIV-risk reduction based on stages of change and MI-principles, such as Personalized Cognitive Counseling, have also been shown to produce meaningful reductions in unprotected sex among these individuals. These parallel lines of research highlight the opportunity for developing a brief, combined intervention for reducing both alcohol use and sex risk among MSM. Adapting and delivering these interventions via a technology-based or mHealth format would also begin to allow the extension of interventions beyond the traditional interactions and settings, potentially improving efficacy, flexibility, and scalability. As such, the proposed research will serve as the foundation for a research program focusing on developing technology-assisted tools that can be easily delivered to high-risk individuals. This three-year project aims to develop and pilot test a brief, combined intervention for reducing heavy drinking and unprotected sex among MSM based on principles of MI. This combined intervention will be adapted to a tablet- based format and developed specifically for use with high-risk MSM in community-based settings. The research involves two phases: Phase 1 involves conducting qualitative research to (1) integrate alcohol use and sex risk intervention components, (2) adapt them to a technology-based format, and (3) understand and address challenges in implementation, feasibility, and acceptability. Phase 2 entails conducting a randomized- controlled pilot test of the intervention among MSM seeking HIV testing in community-based settings to explore its potential impact on alcohol and HIV-related behavioral outcomes. This research will ultimately produce a combined, theory-based, and technology-delivered intervention for heavy drinking and sex risk that is fully portable and has been preliminarily tested for efficacy in community settings where high-risk MSM engage with prevention services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to develop a tablet-based intervention based on principles of motivational interviewing for use in community settings to help high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM) reduce heavy drinking and sex risks. These tools will help MSM at high-risk for HIV acquisition to evaluate their current behavior, consider options for change, and develop a plan for reducing harm. The research will thus provide prevention personnel with an evidence-based, low-cost, high-fidelity tool for reducing risk among high-risk MSM that present for voluntary HIV testing and

"Understanding disparities in effective HIV treatment and prevention: Involvement+ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MSM are a key risk group in the United States and are disproportionately impacted in terms of HIV prevalence and incidence. For decades, black/white disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence have been recognized. Much of the dialogue about disparities has focused on what might cause disparities in new HIV infections, and we recently completed an NIMH-supported R01 (InvolveMENt) to examine reasons for black/white HIV disparities in an HIV/STI incidence cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta. An early, important finding from that study is that HIV-negative black MSM, while having comparable levels of individual risk behaviors, have a much greater chance of having a sex partner with a detectable HIV viral load - thus black MSM are at higher risk for acquiring HIV, despite comparable individual risk behaviors. But disparities extend beyond risks for infection: black MSM may fare less well in the treatment cascade because of later access to care, lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ARV), mistrust of providers, or, perhaps, stigma and discrimination. Recent national estimates have documented consistent racial disparities at each step of the HIV treatment cascade, culminating in a 30% lower likelihood of viral suppression among black non-Hispanic, compared to white non- Hispanic HIV-positive individuals. This pattern has been observed in the state of Georgia. In a Lancet systematic review in 2012, Millet et al. illustrated that the racial disparities after HIV infection are profound for MSM: black MSM were found to be less likely to initiate ARVT, less likely to adhere to therapy, and less likely to be virally suppressed. Further, this analysis suggested that structural factors, such as education, poverty, and lack of employment, played key roles in care disparities. Thus, we propose to build on our previous MSM cohort in Atlanta, to identify the factors that are prospectively associated with racial disparities in effective HIV care and prevention. The proposed work will build on the infrastructure, community relationships, multilevel conceptual framework and multidisciplinary team assembled for our previous grant, but will shift focus from HIV-negative MSM to those living with HIV. The design will be a prospective cohort of HIV-positive black and white MSM in Atlanta, with rich laboratory, survey, and qualitative data collections. Results will help provide deeper understanding of why disparities in care outcomes occur, and will provide actionable data for the development of interventions to reduce disparities in effective HIV care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Profound disparities in effective HIV care exist for black MSM compared to white MSM; the reasons are most likely related to structural and community factors. A cohort study of HIV-positive black and white MSM is proposed to further understanding of these disparities, and suggest possible interventions.",Understanding disparities in effective HIV treatment and prevention: Involvement+,9230326,R01AI112723,"['Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicaid ', ' Millet ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Sentinel ', ' Provider ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' ']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,758382,0.10627880349808765

"PHASTT: A mobile Personalized HIV and STI Testing Tool for young Black men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the U.S. have a disproportionally higher incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Unrecognized and untreated HIV and bacterial STIs are likely fueling these disparities as they exist despite similar individual risk behavior compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Known barriers to HIV and STI testing and treatment include low perceived risks, difficulty accessing providers, lack of engagement in regular healthcare, stigma, and concerns about confidentiality. The recent development of two new technologies, mobile health applications on hand-held devices (mHealth) and home testing for HIV and STIs, offer potential solutions to engage young Black MSM in HIV and STI testing and treatment. The major goals of this research are to test whether a combination of technology-based interventions to increase access and awareness can overcome barriers to engaging young Black MSM in HIV and STI testing and treatment; and to understand key features that enhance uptake. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unrecognized HIV and STIs are likely driving new HIV infections among young Black men who have sex with men in the U.S. With advances in mHealth and home HIV and STI testing strategies, we seek to understand facilitators and barriers to their use, and leverage these technology advances to increase HIV and STI testing frequency and facilitate linkage to care for these men.",PHASTT: A mobile Personalized HIV and STI Testing Tool for young Black men,9187051,K23MH104116,"['driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Awareness ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Hand ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' career development ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' health application ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' screening ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' on-line resource ', ' internet resource ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,K23,2017,200540,0.03617156821453413
"Understanding the Epidemiology of Syphilis in the United States Project Summary/Abstract Syphilis is increasing in the United States (U.S.) and Baltimore has one of the most severe epidemics among Black gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men (MSM). The racial disparities and number of new syphilis infections and reinfections demonstrate that our current prevention strategies are not effective. The proposed study will provide a new understanding of the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of syphilis among Black MSM including HIV infected and uninfected MSM for urban areas in the U.S. in order to identify ways to alter and strengthen local health department practices. We will explicitly address limitations in current practice and previous research on key aspects of the syphilis prevention-care continuum including: syphilis case finding, access to and treatment completion, treatment follow-up and the likelihood of reinfection and co- infection with HIV and other STIs over time. Our approach will include a cohort study of Black MSM, respondent driven-sampling and a focus on places where sexual networks are formed such as sex partner meeting venues (e.g. clubs, bars, internet sites, parks) and their context, as venues have been shown to be an effective method of accessing hard-to-reach populations at risk for syphilis. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Determine sex partner meeting venues and their characteristics (e.g. type, venue network centrality) as well as social and sexual network individual risk behaviors (e.g. sex without a condom, new partners, substance use) associated with new syphilis incidence and repeat syphilis over time; (2) Determine individual (e.g. health care access and usage patterns, insurance status, distance to clinic, substance use), social network (e.g. support, risk network) and systems level (e.g. availability of health care services, cultural competency factors. perceived stigma) healthcare-related factors associated with treatment completion and engagement in follow-up for syphilis over time; and (3) Examine the impact of clinical factors (e.g. syphilis stage, reinfection, baseline nontreponemal titers, HIV and PrEP status) on changes in non- treponemal antibody titers over time following treatment. Our study will be cooperatively designed and conducted by the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD), Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and CDC to inform public health targeted control activities for syphilis and co- morbid syphilis/HIV infection. The BCHD and JHU have a long-standing, successful partnership in the translation of evidence to public health practice. In addition, our expert team has extensive experience and demonstrated past performance in recruitment and retention of MSM in longitudinal studies, and in the collection of sociodemographic, epidemiologic, sexual and social network data and biologic specimens for research purposes. In addition, we bring a rich track record of syphilis clinical care and research, sex partner meeting place research and translation of evidence to public health practice. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase our understanding of the epidemiology of syphilis among Black men-who-have-sex-with-men. Our team is uniquely poised to translate the findings in order to alter and strengthen local health department practices regarding the syphilis prevention-care continuum.",Understanding the Epidemiology of Syphilis in the United States,9392433,U01PS005171,[''],NCHHSTP,BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT,U01,2017,500000,0.06605553670771194
"Evaluation of TransLife Center: A Locally-Developed Combination Prevention Intervention for Transgender Women at High Risk of HIV Infection Combination interventions to reduce disparities in HIV infection for transgender women (TW) who have sex with men are sorely needed, as this population is one of the highest risk and most underserved groups in the United States. The goal of this proposed research project is to evaluate a locally developed and potentially effective intervention, the TransLife Center (TLC), which provides combination (i.e., biomedical, behavioral, social/structural) HIV prevention services to adult TW at high risk for HIV infection, in a culturally specific and highly accessible affirming environment. The TLC intervention directly addresses the structural barriers to health promotion among TW through a coordinated screening and service model, including direct access to services most needed and requested by TW: employment, housing, legal, and health services, following a social determinants of health conceptual model. To date there are no evidence-based HIV prevention interventions (EBIs) for TW listed in the CDC compendium of EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap through collaboration between Chicago House and Social Service Agency (Chicago House), a long-standing HIV/AIDS service provider and HIV prevention researchers who have been actively engaged in the development of HIV prevention interventions for TW. Our experience suggests that Chicago House's TLC intervention is feasible and acceptable to the target population, with over 200 HIV-uninfected TW participating in services over the past three years and evidence suggesting potential efficacy of the intervention for both sexual risk reduction and health promotion. We propose to test the TLC intervention in a single arm trial among 100 HIV-uninfected and sexually active TW, ages 18 and older, and evaluate intervention effectiveness over a 12-month period with visits at 6-month intervals (baseline, 6-months, 12-months). All participants will receive standard-of-care HIV/STI prevention and testing services, assessment and linkage to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as indicated. We will evaluate the TLC intervention via the following aims: AIM 1) To determine the pre-post efficacy of the TLC intervention on the primary outcome: number of condomless anal sex acts without protection by PrEP. 1a) To assess the dose response relationship between intervention exposure as well as exposure to specific components (i.e., employment, housing, legal, and health) on reductions in the primary outcome. 1b) To assess mediation of intervention effects on protective processes (gender affirmation, collective self-esteem, social support) theorized to increase with intervention exposure; AIM 2) To examine intervention implementation experiences through semi-structured interviews with 20 TLC participants and 10 Chicago House staff members. AIM 3) Exploratory Aims: 3a) To describe the trajectory of PrEP indication, uptake, retention and adherence in the community-based sample over a 12-month follow-up period and evaluate the impact of the TLC intervention on the PrEP continuum of care. 3b) To explore whether reductions in HIV risk are associated with epidemiologically-linked moderators including age and race/ethnicity.   Extremely high rates of HIV infection among transgender women (TW) and evidence that socioeconomic marginalization (e.g., unemployment, incarceration, homelessness) drives HIV-related risk indicate a need for comprehensive HIV prevention programs targeted to their unique circumstances. The goal of this proposed research project is to evaluate a locally developed and potentially effective intervention, Chicago House's TransLife Center (TLC), which provides combination (i.e., biomedical, behavioral, social/structural) HIV prevention and care services to adult transgender women at high risk for HIV infection, in a culturally specific and highly accessible affirming environment.

"Social Capital and Late HIV Diagnosis in the United States Project Summary DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate with competencies to become an independent NIH-funded researcher. The candidate’s long-term goal is to develop expertise in HIV prevention research and in community-level HIV prevention design, implementation, and evaluation. The proposed research in the K01 period is to investigate the role of community-level mechanisms linking social capital to late HIV diagnosis in the United States (US). Late HIV diagnosis remains a persistent public health threat in the US; it is associated with poorer survival among HIV+ persons, and drives onward HIV transmission in the community. The association among social capital, mediating mechanisms and HIV diagnosis remains under-investigated in the US. Aim 1: To characterize the longitudinal relationship between social capital and late HIV diagnosis across race/ethnicity. AIM 2: To investigate mechanisms (HIV testing and HIV stigma) in relation to the association between social capital and late HIV diagnosis across race/ethnicity. AIM 3: To develop and pilot social capital indicators, tailored to HIV prevention. The candidate will develop additional training through didactic coursework in 1) advanced quantitative and qualitative research methods including spatial econometrics, ethnography, and community based participatory research; 2) epidemiologic/clinical study design, and 3) intervention development. The candidate will be mentored by a team of internationally renowned experts in HIV prevention research, social determinants of health, causal inference, and HIV surveillance systems. Mentor and advisory committee members are from Harvard University, City University of New York, Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, Emory University, and University of Pennsylvania. Institutional resources available to the candidate include Harvard Center for AIDS Research and The Fenway Institute. Findings from the proposed research will provide the competencies and preliminary data for the candidate to write an R01 or R34 proposal to develop, implement, and evaluate a community-level social capital-based HIV prevention intervention. Project Narrative/ Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed research is to develop a deeper understanding on the role of social capital and late HIV diagnosis in the United States (US), and to better understand mechanisms that link the two. The project also aims to develop an indicator of social capital tailored to HIV prevention that is distinctly different from traditional indicators (e.g., social cohesion or collective efficacy). My research is significant because intervening at the stage of HIV diagnosis could have significant downstream impact on lowering community-level viral load suppression and reducing HIV incidence in key populations.

"Using Phylogenetics to Elucidate HIV Transmission Patterns and Inform Prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a K08 award for Ann Dennis MD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, who is training to become an independent investigator in HIV transmission, epidemiology, and prevention. Despite marked advances in HIV treatment and prevention, new HIV diagnoses continue in the southeastern US where significant disparities still exist among racial minorities and men who have sex with men. Innovative methods are needed to successfully decrease incident HIV infections among these vulnerable groups. The identification of phylogenetic HIV transmission networks or ""clusters"", which are highly related sequences from individuals with shared HIV transmission, offers unique insight into the structure of HIV transmission on a population level that cannot be obtained through contact tracing or other patient-reported history. Paired with clinical and demographic data, these transmission clusters may provide new targets to direct HIV prevention efforts for groups at highest risk for ongoing transmission. The overall research objective is to characterize local phylogenetic clusters in North Carolina and investigate the use of phylogeny in the public health setting to target future interventions. The proposed study will employ innovative methods in molecular epidemiology to reconstruct transmission clusters using large repositories of HIV pol sequences extracted from antiretroviral resistance testing sent during routine clinical care. The aims of the study are to: 1) Identify the temporal and clinical features of emerging or expanding HIV transmission clusters in a large clinical cohort of new and established HIV cases; 2) Assess the effect of higher density sampling of prevalent HIV cases on the detection of transmission clusters and characterize the statewide epidemic structure; and 3) Determine feasibility of incorporating HIV sequence analysis into routine HIV surveillance in a circumscribed geographic area. Dr. Dennis's mentoring team will consist of primary mentor Joseph Eron, MD, Professor of Medicine at UNC with over 20 years of experience in HIV clinical and epidemiologic research. Two co-mentors will offer complementary areas of expertise in HIV epidemiology and phylogenetics: William Miller, MD, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine at UNC whose research focuses on HIV epidemiology; and Stephane Hue, PhD, virologist at University College London, an internationally recognized expert in HIV phylogenetics and UNC collaborator since 2010. Dr. Dennis' training plan links to the proposed research aims: establish a solid foundation in HIV epidemiology including surveillance and outbreak investigation; expand skills in phylogenetic analyses integrating time- scaled and geographic data; and explore ethical issues surrounding phylogenetics in HIV prevention. Training will be accomplished through a combination of didactic courses, workshops, and practicums. These training and research activities will allow Dr. Dennis to mature into an independent investigator and provide a basis for an R01 to implement real-time phylogeny to direct prevention interventions and track trends in HIV incidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV transmission continues in the U.S. despite comprehensive prevention measures; new strategies to find and interrupt chains of ongoing transmission are needed. Combining clinical, demographic, and behavioral data with analysis of highly related HIV nucleotide sequences will allow population-level transmission patterns to be uncovered and support the

"PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Young Black MSM: Neighborhood and Network Determinants PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods, social and sexual networks, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence cross-sectionally and longitudinally among young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Chicago IL metropolitan statistical area (MSA) followed over two years. We will enroll 350 Black MSM in the proposed NIH-funded uConnect Neighborhoods and Networks Cohort Study to address the aims of the research. Eligibility requirements include: HIV-seronegative; self-report no restrictions to usual physical activity; no plans to move outside of Chicago IL MSA in the next two years; and willingness to complete a two-week GPS protocol at nine time-points over two years. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols we have used in our previous feasibility research projects, including studies among Black MSM. In this longitudinal study, three months after completing the initial 2-week GPS protocol, participants will carry the GPS device for an additional 2-weeks every three-months over the two-year study period—for a total of nine times. GPS activity space environment and social/sexual networks data at baseline could potentially influence PrEP outcomes over time. Also, multiple GPS measures and social/sexual networks (at different time points) can better capture the breadth of people’s exposure to neighborhood-level factors and dynamics in social/sexual networks. The proposed study will be the largest GPS study of HIV disparities in any MSM population and presents a remarkable opportunity to study environmental influences on HIV prevention. Findings from the proposed research will impact HIV prevention intervention activities. First, it will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increased community efforts to combat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender hate crime neighborhood rates through increased local police attention in high- crime locations may be an HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV health disparities. Second, from the GPS dataset we will know the travel patterns of Black MSM and therefore be able to identify optimal geographic locations for HIV prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions are seldom geographically targeted. Third, this research will facilitate the identification of geographic locations suitable for recruiting Black MSM in research studies, an improved method of venue- based sampling, in this understudied population. Fourth, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces changes or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. Changing risk environments would suggest that prevention requires significant dynamism and fluidity, as well as rapid change-detection feedback loops. Finally, our dynamic network analysis we propose will deepen understanding of the effects of social and sexual networks on HIV prevention behaviors and will improve network-based HIV prevention interventions.

"Understanding Delayed Access to HIV Prevention Services among Black MSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV AIDS remains a major health crisis among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM). In a recent large-scale HIV seroprevalence survey, prevalence rates were highest among AA MSM (28%), compared to 16% among MSM of all other ethnicities. This is a health disparity that has been replicated in many different studies since the start of the AIDS epidemic. Given the scale of the HIV epidemic among AA MSM, we cannot prevent the ongoing spread of HIV in the United States until we find ways to field effective HIV prevention programs for AA MSM. Combination prevention approaches to HIV/AIDS offer considerable promise to achieve this goal by addressing some of the high risk contexts that increase transmission risk among AA MSM. However, our ability to design effective combination prevention approaches to lower HIV transmission risk among AA MSM depends on achieving a clear epidemiological understanding of both barriers and facilitators to HIV testing, receiving reactive test results for men who are HIV positive and timel access to medical care if HIV positive. Unfortunately, our ability to explain HIV testing and health care access behaviors among AA MSM is currently limited due to the difficulties of recruiting sufficiently large samples of AA MSM who are delaying access to HIV prevention and care services. These shortcomings hamper our ability to draw effective conclusions about targeted prevention efforts for AA MSM, including most fundamentally an informed evidence base upon which combination prevention strategies must be built. Syndemics theory, which examines the effects and interactions among multiple psychosocial health conditions (i.e. substance abuse, depression, violence victimization) associated with increased risks within marginalized and vulnerable populations provides an important theoretical framework to examining these behaviors, especially since it encompasses both vulnerabilities and resiliencies in high risk populations. This application proposes to address this situation by collecting data from a large scale sample of AA MSM (N=6000) to: 1. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of uptake of HIV testing among AA MSM 2. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of unknown HIV seropositivity among AA MSM 3. Measure the prevalence and identify syndemic associations of timely access to care among HIV+ AA MSM By partnering with well-established community groups to recruit large samples of vulnerable men, we will be in a position to characterize the barriers and facilitators to the essential buildig blocks of combination prevention approaches and so provide crucial information for developing effective programs to lower HIV transmission among AA MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV AIDS is a major health crisis among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM).

This study will allow us to characterize for the first time the barriers and facilitators to HIV preventon and care services among these highly vulnerable men and so provide crucial information for developing effective programs to lower HIV transmission among AA MSM.            ",Understanding Delayed Access to HIV Prevention Services among Black MSM,9244681,R01NR013865,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' HIV Seroprevalence ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' virusemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' viraemia ', ' Viremia ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Test Result ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' medically necessary care ', ' medically necessary ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Positive Test Result ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' violence victimization ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,513738,0.04397792657788051
"Natural History of AIDS in Homosexual Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UCLA Center of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study proposes to continue to document  clinical, immunologic, physiologic, behavioral, virologic, genetic and psychosocial changes in  HIV-infected and -uninfected men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM).  This includes proposed  studies to document these changes in MSM recruited 1983-4 and 2001-2, as well as plans to  recruit new untreated and recently treated HIV-infected MSM (primarily African- and Hispanic- Americans), to maintain the cohort. The UCLA MACS will provide leadership and participation in the working groups, MACS-wide and local studies and research publications, and collaborative multi-cohort studies, as it has since the inception of the MACS 30 years ago. The UCLA MACS has recruited a large team of young and established co-investigators from a wide range of disciplines. These investigators have developed, and are continuing to develop, innovative proposals to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology, immunology, genetics and biobehavioral characteristics of treated and untreated HIV infection. The breadth, youth,  experience and innovation of the UCLA MACS investigators, combined with the experience and  commitment of the long-term staff, and our leadership of quality control procedures for  immunologic and virologic measures and specimen processing, will continue to play an  invaluable role in the success of the MACS over the next five years.

"Getting Off: A Theory-based mHealth Intervention for Methamphetamine-using MSM Abstract Methamphetamine (MA) use among men who have sex with men (MSM) is associated with increased rates of HIV prevalence and transmission, as well as substandard advancement along the HIV Prevention and Care Continua. MA use among MSM is deeply integrated into socio-sexual networks including the use of smartphone applications (“app”) and websites to find sexual partners. Given the growth of mobile health technology, it is no longer necessary or reasonable to limit MA treatment options to physical sites, clustered in urban areas, and administered using generic, non-tailored content. The project builds upon the established efficacy of our manualized MA-abuse treatment intervention, “Getting Off: A Behavioral Treatment Intervention for Gay and Bisexual Male Methamphetamine Users,” and the highly promising findings from our successful Stage I proof-of-concept study, to complete translation of Getting Off into a cross-platform (iOS and Android) app and assess the app’s efficacy and non-inferiority in a scientifically rigorous randomized trial. The Getting Off app, like the group-based intervention before it, will use the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Theory and Stages of Change to help MSM reduce or eliminate MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increase advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum (including uptake of HIV testing, pre-, and post- exposure prophylaxis [PEP/PrEP] and PrEP adherence and persistence for those who are HIV negative; ART uptake and adherence for those who are HIV positive). This project will 1) refine and enhance the first 8 sessions of the Getting Off MA-abuse treatment intervention developed in Stage I based on feasibility pilot test user feedback, 2) conduct formative research to develop the remaining 16 sessions of the Getting Off MA- abuse treatment intervention into a cross-platform computerized mobile app targeted to reduce MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increase advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum, and 3) conduct a RCT to evaluate reductions of MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increased advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum, using three approaches: a) Efficacy Trial – a two-arm RCT to determine intervention effects through comparison of the Immediate Delivery (ID; n=150) and Delayed Delivery (DD; n=150) arms; b) Efficacy Trial – an observed treatment effects analysis to compare pre/post data from the pooled ID and DD conditions (N=300); and, c) Non-inferiority Trial – a two-arm historical matched comparison design to evaluate the outcomes of the Getting Off app (ID + DD; N=300) relative to a matched sample of participants having previously attended the brick-and-mortar group-based Getting Off intervention (N~600; total N=900). The RCT uses repeated measures to assess participants at baseline, 1-, 2- (DD condition only), 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up. This study could have significant public health impact by greatly expanding access to effective, affordable, private, culturally competent and highly scalable MA treatment to this very high-risk population. Project Narrative Methamphetamine (MA) use among MSM is strongly associated with HIV infection and interrupted progression along the HIV Prevention and Care Continua. This study will complete the development and evaluation of an evidence-based, theory-driven, and culturally competent treatment app for MA-using MSM, designed to reduce or eliminate MA use and HIV sexual risks, increase uptake of HIV testing and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP), including PrEP adherence and persistence for those who are HIV negative, and increase retention in HIV care and adherence to ART for those who are HIV positive. Given the severe personal and public health consequences of MA use, the public health significance of this app is very high as it will provide this population with a tailored treatment opportunity that is easily accessible, affordable, private, and highly scalable.",Getting Off: A Theory-based mHealth Intervention for Methamphetamine-using MSM,9628755,R01DA045562,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM Project Summary  Adolescent (ages 13-18) men who have sex with men (AMSM) experience a dramatic health disparity as they represent 2% of young people but account for almost 80% of HIV diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based HIV prevention programs. Implementation issues are critical as traditional HIV prevention delivery channels (community organizations, schools, parents), have significant limitations when it comes to AMSM. eHealth interventions represent an excellent modality for delivering AMSM-specific intervention material where youth “are.”  We should not continue to deliver the same intervention when a participant is not responding. Rather, stepped-care strategies increase in intensity to meet the needs of those who do not respond to a less intense intervention. Using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, we will evaluate the impact of a package of increasingly intensive interventions that have already shown evidence of efficacy with diverse adolescent and young adult MSM. The SMART design is an ideal approach to achieve the goals of this RFA because SMART designs mimic treatment decisions as they are made in real-world clinical settings. Collectively we brand our package of eHealth interventions as the SMART Program (Sexual Minority Adolescent Risk Taking). The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis. Public Health Relevance Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group among youth in the US and rates of infections are increasing, however, few HIV prevention programs have been developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve public health by establishing the effectiveness of an innovative, eHealth HIV prevention program for YMSM.",A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM,9581303,U01MD011281,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Magic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' implementation trial ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' community organizations ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' queer ', ' trial design ', ' adolescent MSM ', ' AMSM ', ' adolescent men who have sex with men ', ' recruit ', ' program costs ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2018,107361,0.03355851604940887
"Structural Stigma and HIV Prevention Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. At current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Extant research has largely focused on identifying individual- and interpersonal-level risk factors for HIV infection among GBM; however, accumulating evidence also points to structural determinants of HIV outcomes in this population. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that structural stigma—defined as societal- level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the resources and opportunities of stigmatized individuals—is associated with adverse health outcomes, including HIV risk, among GBM. For example, pilot data from our research group showed that 4,098 GBM living in states with high levels of structural stigma—measured with a composite index of discriminatory state laws and negative social attitudes towards homosexuality—had lower levels of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge and use, lower odds of HIV testing, and greater odds of condomless anal sex compared with those living in low structural stigma states. While promising, the few existing studies of structural stigma and HIV outcomes among GBM have been limited by a reliance on cross-sectional designs, a small number of structural covariates, little attention to mediators/moderators of the structural stigma-HIV risk association, and non-probability samples of GBM. To address these limitations, we will create a new, prospective, nationally representative study of HIV-uninfected/unknown status GBM who will be followed for 5 waves of data collection over a 24-month period (N=500). With a representative sample of participants from across the U.S., we will have substantial variation in the social context surrounding GBM. This will be the first and largest prospective study with a nationally representative sample of GBM specifically designed to: (1) examine whether structural forms of stigma related to sexual identity increase vulnerability to adverse HIV prevention outcomes (e.g., less HIV testing and PEP/PrEP use); (2) identify mutable mechanisms (e.g., self-stigma, depressive symptoms, safer-sex self efficacy) through which structural stigma influences HIV outcomes; and (3) evaluate resilience processes (e.g., LGB community connectedness) that may mitigate the negative effects of structural stigma on HIV outcomes. In the final phase of the project, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 key informants and 30 GBM. We will use data from these interviews, together with the quantitative results, to inform the development of multi-level HIV intervention strategies that are maximally responsive to the structural conditions in which GBM are embedded. We have assembled a team of experts in structural stigma, HIV prevention among GBM, qualitative research, and survey research with nationally representative samples to address our study aims. This project stands to make important contributions to research on reducing disparities in the incidence of HIV infections among GBM, identified as a high NIH HIV/AIDS research priority. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the United States; further, recent estimates suggest that at current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Research into the underlying factors that can explain this risk—especially at the structural level, which has been relatively understudied—constitutes a critical area for public health. The goal of this proposed research is to evaluate structural determinants of HIV prevention outcomes among a nationally representative cohort of GBM, which will provide essential information that can be used to inform the development of effective HIV preventive strategies that address the social conditions surrounding the general population of GBM.",Structural Stigma and HIV Prevention Outcomes,9531446,R01MH112384,"['Affect ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Services ', ' Safe Sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' secondary outcome ', ' family support ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,578853,0.04717313603330204
"Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM Project Summary/Abstract Racial/ethnic disparities in HIV have been a hallmark of the US HIV epidemic for decades, with black/African Americans experiencing higher rates of HIV infection than white Americans. These disparities are also observed in men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom the highest incidence rates are in young black/African American MSM (YBAAMSM). Despite a rich literature demonstrating the prevalent levels of drug and alcohol use among MSM and the potential relationships between these substances and high-risk sexual behaviors, individual risk behaviors do not explain why black MSM and YBAAMSM are more likely to become infected with HIV, compared to other MSM. Studies of self-reported use have collectively demonstrated no greater substance use among black MSM than among white MSM. However, a key finding of our previous R01, which examined factors associated with prevalent and incident HIV infection among a prospective cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta, was that black MSM had substantially lower validity of self-reported drug use, compared to white MSM. Biomarker-classified drug use was also more predictive of HIV seroconversions than self-reported sexual behavior measures, suggesting that, in this population, substance use may be a marker of high-risk partners and environments. Furthermore, the racial disparity in prevalent HIV infection was most associated with differences in network and community factors rather than individual factors. Despite emerging data on sexual partners and structures among YBAAMSM, little is known about the overlap of sexual and substance-use networks, though this might amplify HIV/STI transmission risk. Therefore, we propose to conduct a new prospective cohort study of 300 HIV-negative YBAAMSM in Atlanta, GA, to understand prospective patterns of biomarker-supported substance use in YBAAMSM, as well as its antecedents, contexts, and consequences. This new project will build on the strong institutional infrastructure, community partnerships, theoretical frameworks, analytical approaches, and multidisciplinary research that contributed to the success of our previous cohort study. Results will provide a more detailed understanding of the multilevel associations between substance use and HIV risk, and will yield new opportunities for combination interventions that address the syndemics of HIV/STI and drug use among YBAAMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Profound disparities in HIV incidence exist for young black/African American MSM compared to other subgroups of MSM. Substance use is prevalent and associated with HIV infection for young black/African American MSM, but the mechanisms by which substances impart added HIV risk are unclear. A cohort study of HIV-negative black MSM ages 18-29 is proposed to further understanding of the relationships between substances and HIV/STI incidence and risk behaviors, and suggest possible interventions.",Understanding substance use and incident HIV/STI among young black MSM,9488467,R01DA038196,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Modality ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sentinel ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validity of Self Report ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' cocaine use ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive marker ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' marijuana use ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' METH using ', ' METH use ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' community partnership ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' Drug Screening ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,613824,0.048950165357782495
"HIV intervention models for criminal justice involved substance-using Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such ""shocks"" lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM.

"A Multilevel Network Model of Drug Use and HIV Racial Disparities in Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are disproportionately affected by HIV, with an annual incidence higher than any other age or race group. Despite this increasing epidemic, few studies have focused on MSM nor accounted for these disparities. The research that has examined disparities in MSM has been focused on understanding individual-level behavior, but this has been inadequate to explain HIV racial disparities. Additionally, network research is increasingly a priority area in HIV research due to the disease's high transmission dependence on drug and sexual network dynamics. However, network descriptions alone are also inadequate without considering the interplay of individual and contextual factors. Instead, it has been suggested that a broader systems-level perspective may be necessary as several interacting individual, network, and contextual differences may account for the increased epidemic in Black MSM populations. Due to this call for a systems-level perspective in understanding and preventing HIV infection, this grant seeks to advance understandings of HIV racial disparities in MSM by examining individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors within a multilevel network model. This model will be tested within an exceptional U01 NIDA-funded cohort of 1,200 diverse Chicago YMSM (PI: Primary Mentor Mustanski), which is collecting original multilevel (biologic, individual, dyadic, network) data. Utilizing methods developed within the applicant's R03 Project, YMSM will complete social (social, sexual, drug) and contextual (neighborhood & venue) network interviews. Building the study into the U01 cohort allows the current project to benefit from the strong infrastructure and resources of the U01, fortifies this project's feasibility, and provides unique opportunities to expand the aims of the U01. Data from this comprehensive longitudinal multilevel dataset will be used to build and validate a model of social contextual influences on racial disparities in HIV through innovative analyses and methods that account for the complex dynamics of HIV transmission and racial disparities. The overall project has two aims: 1) Identify social contextua factors (i.e., social relational and social contextual) which contribute to racial disparities in HV and 2) Examine the interplay of individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors in racial disparities in HIV.

"HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies Promising new tools for HIV prevention and treatment have stimulated global initiatives to “End the HIV Epidemic” and reach the “End of AIDS;” however, significant challenges to ending the global HIV epidemic remain. Biomedical advances for prevention and treatment will not reach their full potential without rigorous behavioral and social science research to optimize uptake, adherence, and equitable and effective implementation and scale-up. Thus, we propose a renewed HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies that expands on our history of conducting interdisciplinary HIV research and leverages new partnerships to maximize the potential of biomedical advances, addressing their availability and acceptability to the most vulnerable populations. The HIV Center is unique among NIMH AIDS Research Centers (ARCs) in being based in New York City (NYC), a continuing US AIDS epicenter in a state that has the greatest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, including ethnic/racial minority populations coping with extreme economic, health, and social disparities. In 2014, HIV Center investigators and other academicians, providers, advocates, and policy-makers joined the Office of the Governor of New York State (NYS) to develop a NYS Blueprint for Ending the Epidemic (EtE). The Blueprint provides the HIV Center with the unique opportunity to use our home city and state as a “laboratory” to study implementation of EtE initiatives and apply lessons learned to US and global epidemics. Thus, in the next five years, the HIV Center will be guided by the theme, The Science of Ending the HIV/AIDS Epidemic (EtE): Efficacy to Effectiveness at Scale, and its emphasis on implementation research and research at the intersection of behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences.  The HIV Center brings together a cadre of investigators at the forefront of multiple disciplines to address three Specific Aims: (1) to catalyze intervention and implementation science research necessary to achieve EtE goals; (2) to translate research into culturally and structurally competent practice and policy for maximum public health impact; and (3) to increase the capacity of current and future generations of scientists, service providers, and community and policy leaders to create and implement biomedical, behavioral, social, and structural HIV prevention and treatment interventions to meet EtE goals. Our Cores ensure methodological and theoretical rigor, identify and rapidly respond to new trends in the epidemic, support critical research- practice partnerships, and train new scientists. We complement the Administrative and Development Cores with three Research Cores: (1) Statistics, Assessment, and Data Management (StAD) Core, focused on innovative analytic, assessment, and data management strategies; (2) Bio-Behavioral Core, focused on research at the interface of the biomedical and the behavioral and social sciences; and (3) Implementation Science and Health Outcomes (ISHO) Core focused on effective, sustained, and equitable achievement of HIV prevention and care outcomes at scale. The HIV Center will continue as a global leader in HIV prevention and the fight to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV-related health and social disparities that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable – women, youth, racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations, and other disenfranchised groups. We will work to meet “Ending the HIV Epidemic” goals by synergizing institutional and intellectual resources; invigorating our multidisciplinary community of scientists, clinicians, and policy-makers; rigorously training a new generation of scientists; supporting research partnerships with public health policy and practice sectors; and translating transformative NIH-supported HIV/AIDS research into real-world practice and policy. We will apply the lessons learned from our research to improve the health and well being of all affected by the HIV epidemic, regardless of where they reside.",HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies,9565063,P30MH043520,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' Generations ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' fighting ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' data management ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' health economics ', ' implementation research ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' social disparities ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community based service ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' health practice ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' social science research ', ' sexual minority ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' service providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P30,2018,1602777,0.04694597226673286
"Network Dynamics of Syphillis Coinfection within Biomedical Prevention ABSTRACT In the United States (US), the highest percentage increase in primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis rates occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM). Among MSM, the rates of P&S syphilis have increased disproportionately among young Black MSM (YBMSM). The syphilis epidemic among MSM also has been marked by a high rate of HIV co-infection for biological/virologic, behavioral, and epidemiological reasons. Syphilis and HIV epidemics overlap, in part, because syphilis facilitates HIV infection by disrupting normally protective mucosal and epithelial barriers, and this in turn causes co-infected sex partners to be at greater risk of transmitting HIV to uninfected individuals. From an epidemiological network perspective, infections with both syphilis and HIV occur most frequently in network contexts in which HIV-uninfected MSM belong to sexual networks with a high prevalence of HIV and syphilis. Such sexual networks may be formed through social spaces or venues frequented by syphilis-infected MSM, where HIV is often co-prevalent. Thus, the social venues of YBMSM may provide clues to sexual network formation and downstream syphilis infections. We conceptualize syphilis-dynamics among YBMSM as social processes that are co-evolved with HIV dynamics, sexual behavioral dynamics and network contextual dynamics (social space, sex/social/peer relationships). In addition, we conceptualize that these social processes are affected by the behavioral dynamics of ARV-based prevention factors (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP], treatment as prevention [TasP], and seroadaptive/sorting behaviors. This application employs state-of-the-art longitudinal network and behavioral dynamics modeling methodologies to address the epidemiological problem of co- evolving syphilis and HIV epidemics. These methodologies have the capability to model the complex dynamic processes at multiple levels simultaneously, taking into account syphilis-HIV transmission dynamics, sex- behavioral dynamics, network dynamics, and risk-reduction behavioral dynamics among YBMSM. We propose to use existing empirical longitudinal data of YBMSM aged 16 to 29 in two large urban cities, Houston and Chicago to develop potential points of entry for intervention strategies to limit syphilis transmission (i.e., post- exposure prophylaxis, network-level syphilis treatment). Our specific aims are to: (1) model syphilis infection dynamics, co-evolved with HIV infection, sex behavior, network contexts of social space and sexual/social relationships; (2) examine how these social processes affect and are affected risk reduction behaviors and by HIV biomedical prevention. This study has the potential to deepen our understanding of the drivers of syphilis infection in the context of networks, behavior, and risk reduction. The results will lead directly to interventions that identify key levers of syphilis transmission as well as additional research that models how emerging syphilis prevention approaches such as syphilis post-exposure prophylaxis may be integrated into HIV prevention options in the U.S. RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of the proposed network study is to investigate complex syphilis-HIV transmission dynamic processes, coevolved with sex behavioral dynamic, and sexual network dynamic, and risk reduction behavioral dynamic among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed study is relevant to public health, as it addresses fundamental questions about human health behavior, from biological, behavioral, and epidemiological perspectives, to alleviate racial/ethnic health disparities in disease rates in regard to YBMSM. This study will provide new directions for developing effective interventions to better understand the growing epidemic of HIV and syphilis co-infection and to create effective syphilis eliminations interventions for most-at-risk population in the United States.",Network Dynamics of Syphillis Coinfection within Biomedical Prevention,9561607,R21AI139480,"['innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' effective intervention ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' coinfection ', ' co-infection ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Evolution ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methodology ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Mucosa ', ' Persons ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' United States ', ' virology ', ' Work ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Epithelial ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Collaborations ', ' Oral Sex ', ' Complex ', ' age group ', ' social space ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' Graph ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' aged ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2018,211880,0.0440547632685576
"Center for AIDS Intervention Research Core Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes the renewal for 2014-2019 of the Center for AIDS Intervention Research (CAIR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin as an HIV behavioral research Center. CAIR's thematic mission is the conceptualization, conduct, and rigorous evaluation of interventions to prevent HIV infection in communities most vulnerable to the disease; the development of interventions to improve health outcomes among persons living with the disease; and the rapid dissemination of research findings to both the scientific community and public health service provides. The Center's Core structure supports the efforts of an interdisciplinary team of HIV prevention investigators, and CAIR has been highly productive and a strong regional, national, and international resource in the areas of research, training, and service to the scientific and public health communities. CAIR Investigators have made distinguished scientific contributions in the development of HIV prevention interventions for high-incidence populations in the United States, Eastern Europe, and other regions of the world; have advanced the field's scientific knowledge of how to transfer scientific advances to benefit service providers nationally and internationally; and have undertaken vigorous lines of behavioral and social science, methodological, and cost-effectiveness research applied to HIV prevention. CAIR's specific aims during the renewal period are: 1) the development of behavioral, social, and structural interventions that will lead to wide scale public health implementation of recently-emerging biomedical HIV prevention strategies; 2) establishing the effectiveness of multi-level HIV prevention interventions that combine potent behavioral, social, structural, and biomedical interventions to achieve greatest public health impact in reducing HIV incidence; 3) reducing HIV-related health disparities; and 4) serving as a resource that rapidly transforms scientific advances into sustainable public health practice.

"Understanding disparities in effective HIV treatment and prevention: Involvement+ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MSM are a key risk group in the United States and are disproportionately impacted in terms of HIV prevalence and incidence. For decades, black/white disparities in HIV prevalence and incidence have been recognized. Much of the dialogue about disparities has focused on what might cause disparities in new HIV infections, and we recently completed an NIMH-supported R01 (InvolveMENt) to examine reasons for black/white HIV disparities in an HIV/STI incidence cohort of black and white MSM in Atlanta. An early, important finding from that study is that HIV-negative black MSM, while having comparable levels of individual risk behaviors, have a much greater chance of having a sex partner with a detectable HIV viral load - thus black MSM are at higher risk for acquiring HIV, despite comparable individual risk behaviors. But disparities extend beyond risks for infection: black MSM may fare less well in the treatment cascade because of later access to care, lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ARV), mistrust of providers, or, perhaps, stigma and discrimination. Recent national estimates have documented consistent racial disparities at each step of the HIV treatment cascade, culminating in a 30% lower likelihood of viral suppression among black non-Hispanic, compared to white non- Hispanic HIV-positive individuals. This pattern has been observed in the state of Georgia. In a Lancet systematic review in 2012, Millet et al. illustrated that the racial disparities after HIV infection are profound for MSM: black MSM were found to be less likely to initiate ARVT, less likely to adhere to therapy, and less likely to be virally suppressed. Further, this analysis suggested that structural factors, such as education, poverty, and lack of employment, played key roles in care disparities. Thus, we propose to build on our previous MSM cohort in Atlanta, to identify the factors that are prospectively associated with racial disparities in effective HIV care and prevention. The proposed work will build on the infrastructure, community relationships, multilevel conceptual framework and multidisciplinary team assembled for our previous grant, but will shift focus from HIV-negative MSM to those living with HIV. The design will be a prospective cohort of HIV-positive black and white MSM in Atlanta, with rich laboratory, survey, and qualitative data collections. Results will help provide deeper understanding of why disparities in care outcomes occur, and will provide actionable data for the development of interventions to reduce disparities in effective HIV care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Profound disparities in effective HIV care exist for black MSM compared to white MSM; the reasons are most likely related to structural and community factors. A cohort study of HIV-positive black and white MSM is proposed to further understanding of these disparities, and suggest possible interventions.",Understanding disparities in effective HIV treatment and prevention: Involvement+,9427975,R01AI112723,"['Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicaid ', ' Millet ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Sentinel ', ' Provider ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' black/white disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIAID,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,756782,0.10627880349808765
"Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the happy consequences of HAART is that HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals now have available to them medications that allow them to reach old age. This means that we have the previously unexpected challenge of finding ways to support healthy aging in communities with high HIV prevalence rates. This challenge is likely to be particularly difficult among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to not only their very high background HIV prevalence rates but also the general dearth of proven models to promote healthy aging among older MSM. To meet this challenge, we need to develop health promotion programs that are more potent than the efficacious but time-limited effects found among HIV prevention interventions. Thus, we need to identify mechanisms to raise levels of intervention efficacy to support healthy aging beyond those that have already been tapped to support other health promotion efforts among MSM. In previous research by our group, we documented that specific resiliencies among MSM appear to have robust health-promoting properties. Resiliencies research conducted among aging MSM is an innovative agenda on several counts. The dominant approach to explaining patterns of health among MSM has been to study the effects of deficits in creating health disparities. While an emphasis on deficits is useful in explaining the life course trajectories of men who have multiple psychosocial health problems that result in poor health outcomes, this focus is less helpful in explaining the trajectories of te far larger proportion of MSM who have also experienced cultural marginalization and yet remain healthy well into later life. This application proposes the following aims to test a theory-based approach to identifying both deficits and resiliencies among aging MSM over six waves of data collection (N=1850) using an ongoing cohort study.1)To measure changes in prevalence rates of psychosocial health problems and resiliencies over time; 2)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with changes in substance use and other psychosocial health problems and to test whether resiliencies moderate the pathway to syndemics; and 3)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with better HIV-related outcomes and biomarkers among HIV-positive MSM and to test if resiliencies moderate the impact of syndemics on these same outcomes. By identifying the resiliencies already used by some aging MSM to stay healthy but which have yet to be incorporated in current health promotion efforts for MSM, we can progress to the testing of potentially efficacious health promotion programs to support healthy aging among MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although many older men who have sex with men (MSM) exhibit significant strengths that have helped them remain healthy well into later life, these strategies have not been well documented. In particular, the strengths, or resiliencies, of older MSM have not been carefully studied in terms of their ability to support health as men age. This study will use a theory-based approach to follow aging MSM in six waves of an ongoing cohort study to document how resiliencies moderate the effects of health risks to better explain patterns of health and illness among aging MSM.",Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men,9513323,R01MD010680,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' violent partner ', ' partner violence ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' resilience ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older men ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' rate of change ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,589047,0.08162792676186323

"HIV intervention models for criminal justice involved substance-using Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such ""shocks"" lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations.

"Efficacy of Couples-Based HIV Prevention in Vulnerable Young Men Project Summary Adolescent and young adult men who have sex with men (YMSM) are the only group in the U.S. in which rates of new HIV infections are increasing, which reflects a large disparity relative to heterosexuals. Steady or main partner relationships account for a substantial proportion of new HIV infections in YMSM. Among YMSM a serious relationship status is perhaps the strongest predictor of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), and pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be discontinued in a relationship. Romantic relationships also provide myriad benefits, including promotion of mental, behavioral, and physical health. Despite the critical importance of romantic relationship factors for HIV prevention, the vast majority of studies and interventions focus on individuals. We conducted formative research on coupled YMSM through an NIH R21 from which we developed an innovative couples-based intervention that addresses the continuum of HIV prevention and care for YMSM couples. The 2GETHER program integrates couples- and group-based modalities and is innovative in its design to address HIV transmission risk in couples regardless of serostatus; couples learn to utilize behavioral and biomedical approaches to prevent both HIV acquisition and transmission, with an overarching emphasis on improving relationship functioning. 2GETHER further encourages uptake of couples-based HIV testing for HIV-/unknown YMSM and medication adherence and engagement in care for HIV+ YMSM. We established feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of 2GETHER in a pilot trial of coupled YMSM (N=60 couples; 120 individuals), including significant decreases in HIV transmission risk behavior. Based on our highly successful pilot, we propose to test the efficacy of 2GETHER in large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will: (a) enroll racially diverse coupled YMSM; (b) randomize couples to either the 2GETHER intervention or attention-matched positive affect skills program for couples; (c) measure intervention outcomes through 12 months post-intervention. Analysis of study outcomes will utilize both individual- and dyadic-level data. Primary HIV risk behavioral outcome: an individual-level dichotomous variable indicating presence of CAI with a serodiscordant or unknown status partner. Exploratory analysis will calculate an innovative variable that accounts for the relative risk of sexual behaviors with partners of different serostatus, accounting for biomedical prevention. Primary biomedical outcome: Chlamydia/Gonnorhea incidence in individuals. Secondary dyadic-level HIV risk outcomes: concordance/discordance in relationship sexual agreement type and presence of agreement breaks. Secondary individual-level engagement in care outcomes: HIV testing uptake (HIV- men) and medication adherence (HIV+ men). In the context of increasing fatigue for HIV prevention, a healthy relationships program for coupled YMSM presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Further, in the era of treatment as prevention, we must develop transmission prevention strategies for MSM regardless of serostatus that address the full continuum of prevention and care. Project Narrative Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM), but YMSM report increasing fatigue with HIV prevention messages and strategies. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among YMSM by establishing the efficacy of an innovative, healthy relationship program for coupled YMSM (regardless of HIV status) that aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies, as well as primary and secondary prevention approaches.",Efficacy of Couples-Based

"Center/Coordination, Analysis and Management/MACS This application is to renew the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a comprehensive quality-assured  prospective cohort study of over 7000 men, which has contributed almost 1300 research papers on the  natural history of HIV infection and the impact of effective combination antiretroviral therapies (cART). The  follow-up of the existing cohort with continuing dynamic enrollment will enable elucidation of long-term  effects of cART, including newer and evolving cART regimens, in men who have sex with men (MSM), the  largest population impacted by HIV in the U.S. The overarching goals of the MACS are to continue to  elucidate the biology of infection and the clinical outcomes of treated and untreated infection, combining  immunologic, virologic, genetic and psychosocial approaches. The scientific agenda of the MACS focuses on  four primary areas: 1) clinical epidemiology of HIV-related and non-AIDS-defining outcomes with particular  emphasis on the effects of cART and age; 2) pathogenic mechanisms underlying HIV susceptibility, disease  progression and treatment response including genetic and other molecular factors; 3) psychosocial factors,  including substance use which influence risk of HIV infection, co-morbidities and treatment utilization; and 4)  development of novel applied methodology. Following HIV-uninfected MSM with the same standardized  protocols will facilitate distinguishing the contributions of HIV, age, genetics,co-infections and behaviors on  the development of non-AIDS-defining outcomes including malignancies, and aging. The role of unresolved  inflammation and immune activation, and more rapid senescence of the immune system, on disease course  in treated HIV will be investigated. Data with linked specimens, particularly from over 700 HIV seroconverters,  provides an unparalleled resource for studying the entire natural history of HIV, ranging from pre-infection  (e.g. susceptibility) to infection, through treatment to old age and death. The MACS is and will  continue to be ideally positioned to address these issues because of its long-term standardized follow-up, an  extensive repository of over 1 million specimens that have been collected semiannually since 1984, an  appropriate control group of HIV- MSM, and a seasoned and expanding cadre of experienced investigators. In the US, the highest HIV incidence is among men who have sex with men (MSM), and with effective  treatment, the median age of HIV-infected persons is soon expected to be 50 years. The MACS is ideal for  elucidating biological and psychosocial effects of aging with HIV, and effects of evolving therapies on  biomarkers related to resulting outcomes. The proposed research will provide information for development of  vaccines for HIV as well as for the prevention of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining outcomes.","Center/Coordination, Analysis and

"Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men ABSTRACT From 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among MSM aged 13-24 years old more than doubled. There are stark racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections among YMSM; 13- 24 year old racial and ethnic minority MSM now represent a rapidly growing share of all new HIV infections. Although the likelihood of HIV acquisition is greater at older ages, many of the cognitive and behavioral risk factors that contribute to the risk of HIV infection rates develop in adolescence. As adolescent MSM (AMSM; 13-18 years old) begin to develop and express gender and sexual identities, to experiment and begin sexual behaviors, and to begin to establish a sense of self, there is the opportunity to parallel this period of growth with targeted, tailored interventions that equip AMSM with the life skills they need to reduce their vulnerability to HIV risk and to establish the life skills necessary to manage risk. We developed a mobile-friendly WebApp intervention focused on life skills training (iCON) across 16 topics, ranging from stigma and discrimination to sexual health, with links to local resources. In the proposed activities, we will adapt iCON for four U.S regions heavily impacted by HIV, and revise the content to include materials that are age-appropriate for 13 to 18 year- olds. Given the role that stigma and social isolation plays in the lives of many AMSM, we also propose to embed a peer-to-peer motivational interviewing component to iCON, allowing participants to access motivational interviewing counseling via VSee video-chat. With a large and diverse sample (n=500), we will test the efficacy of the intervention, now referred to as iCON+, on cognitive and behavioral HIV-related outcomes using a two-arm randomized control design. In addition, we examine whether structural characteristics in a region (e.g., race/ethnicity segregation, HIV prevalence) influence the efficacy of the proposed intervention. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Adapt a multilevel, online life skills intervention (iCON+) to address HIV vulnerability among AMSM living in four heavily impacted regions constituting diverse racial/ethnic and geographic areas (Chicago-Detroit; Atlanta-Washington, DC; Memphis- New Orleans; San Francisco-San Diego) in the US. (2) Test the efficacy of iCON+, as compared to a delayed intervention condition, to improve cognitive (e.g., comfort discussing sexuality; HIV prevention attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, behavioral intentions) and behavioral (e.g., condom use, HIV testing, PrEP use) factors using a prospective RCT design. (3) Examine the differential efficacy of iCON+ in improving psychosocial mediators (e.g., personal competency) associated with our outcomes and (4) Examine how socio-ecological determinants at the individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, urbanity) and regional (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, HIV prevalence) level are associated with iCON+'s efficacy. PROJECT RELEVANCE Consistent with the National HIV/AIDS Prevention Plan's call to reduce new HIV infections by intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities where HIV is most heavily concentrated, we propose to deliver and test a life skills intervention targeting the key domains that fuel HIV disparities among adolescent MSM in the United States. This RCT will yield important information regarding the delivery of a developmentally-appropriate HIV prevention program that reaches racial/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse sample of AMSM across four regions in the United States.",Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men,9445467,U01MD011274,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20

"PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Young Black MSM: Neighborhood and Network Determinants PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods, social and sexual networks, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence cross-sectionally and longitudinally among young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Chicago IL metropolitan statistical area (MSA) followed over two years. We will enroll 350 Black MSM in the proposed NIH-funded uConnect Neighborhoods and Networks Cohort Study to address the aims of the research. Eligibility requirements include: HIV-seronegative; self-report no restrictions to usual physical activity; no plans to move outside of Chicago IL MSA in the next two years; and willingness to complete a two-week GPS protocol at nine time-points over two years. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols we have used in our previous feasibility research projects, including studies among Black MSM. In this longitudinal study, three months after completing the initial 2-week GPS protocol, participants will carry the GPS device for an additional 2-weeks every three-months over the two-year study period—for a total of nine times. GPS activity space environment and social/sexual networks data at baseline could potentially influence PrEP outcomes over time. Also, multiple GPS measures and social/sexual networks (at different time points) can better capture the breadth of people’s exposure to neighborhood-level factors and dynamics in social/sexual networks. The proposed study will be the largest GPS study of HIV disparities in any MSM population and presents a remarkable opportunity to study environmental influences on HIV prevention. Findings from the proposed research will impact HIV prevention intervention activities. First, it will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increased community efforts to combat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender hate crime neighborhood rates through increased local police attention in high- crime locations may be an HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV health disparities. Second, from the GPS dataset we will know the travel patterns of Black MSM and therefore be able to identify optimal geographic locations for HIV prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions are seldom geographically targeted. Third, this research will facilitate the identification of geographic locations suitable for recruiting Black MSM in research studies, an improved method of venue- based sampling, in this understudied population. Fourth, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces changes or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. Changing risk environments would suggest that prevention requires significant dynamism and fluidity, as well as rapid change-detection feedback loops. Finally, our dynamic network analysis we propose will deepen understanding of the effects of social and sexual networks on HIV prevention behaviors and will improve network-based HIV prevention interventions.

"Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men  The overarching goal of this proposed study is to leverage existing and ongoing data to examine the role of sexual behavior stigma on access to HIV healthcare as well as sexual and mental health outcomes among men who have sex with men (MSM). Worldwide MSM are a key population that bear a disproportionate burden of HIV with high prevalence and incidence yet they have low uptake and/or access to treatment and prevention. Consistent with NIH HIV/AIDS research priorities, the proposed project aims to reduce health disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes by addressing stigma towards MSM in the context of intersecting stigmas and potentially modifiable mediators (e.g., depression). In particular, validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed to effectively measure stigma-related interventions and to better understand the mechanisms of how stigma potentiates HIV risks among this key population. We propose to leverage existing data collected from over 15,000 MSM across 7 different Sub-Saharan African nations, the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS), the UCLA mSTUDY, and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 078 study on Enhancing Recruitment, Linkage to Care and Treatment for HIV-Infected MSM in the US. The specific aims of the work are: Aim 1) Develop validated measures used to assess sexual behavior stigma among MSM using factor analysis and validity and reliability testing. This will result in finalized stigma metrics and recommendations for integration of MSM stigma items that can be used in future studies. Aim 2) Identify specific mediated associations between stigma and HIV-related outcomes using structural equation modeling. In addition, test for intersectionality of multiple forms of stigma (e.g., gender, HIV status, race/ethnicity) using an inter- and intra-categorical approach. The delivered outcomes will include quantified associations of sexual behavior stigma with HIV-related outcomes that can be used to inform HIV intervention planning by setting feasible targets for stigma mitigation interventions. Aim 3) Include final validated stigma metrics in an upcoming cycle of AMIS and bio-validate the stigma metrics. Bio-validation will consist of testing associations of sexual behavior stigma with testing positive for sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia and gonorrhea), and with chronic stress measured using telomere DNA length. Participants will self-collect urine, rectal, and saliva specimens using home-based STI test kits. Overall, the proposed study will result in a thorough assessment of a sexual behavior stigma scale for MSM and how it operates comparatively with other types of stigma. The validated stigma metrics will provide recommendations for future studies that seek to measure stigma and its relation to HIV among this key population. The World Health Organization, UNAIDS, and the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy have collectively called for the need to reduce stigma towards MSM as a vital component of an effective HIV response. Consistent and validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed in the context of multiple intersecting stigmas; therefore, the proposed research project will develop, test, and validate sexual behavior stigma metrics using existing and ongoing data collected across Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. Using bio- specimens collected in the American Men's Internet Survey, the proposed project will additionally contribute to the understanding of relationships between stigma and risk for chronic stress

"Estimating Mediation and Moderation Effects in HIV Incidence Prevention Trials Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this project is to analyze existing behavioral interventions designed to reduce HIV incidence in order to examine the mechanisms (i.e., mediators) that predict efficacy, and the subgroups for whom (i.e., moderators) interventions are efficacious. We propose to use advanced approaches to analyzing mediators and moderators. Specifically, we will utilize methods that allow indirect (mediated) effects to be directly tested and quantified, even in interventions that do not find a significant total X ÞY effect (i.e., efficacy). We propose to analyze data from four large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the efficacy of behavioral interventions on an HIV incidence outcome; two trials were showed a significant effect on HIV, two had null results on HIV. We will use the novel approach called “conditional process modeling” which simultaneously models mediators and moderators and tests both how and for whom an intervention works, helping to identify different processes leading to efficacy for different subgroups (AIM 1). We will compare the significant and the null trials in their significant mediators and moderators and model characteristics to examine possible situations of masked efficacy in the null trials (AIM 2). We will utilize cutting-edge advancements in causal mediation analysis. Specifically, we will conduct sensitivity analysis to estimate the extent to which a mediator is primarily responsible for producing effects on HIV, strengthening causal inference about mediators leading to reduced HIV transmission in the interventions (AIM 3). To our knowledge these novel statistical approaches have never been used to analyze mediators and moderators in HIV intervention RCTs. We will also explore the use of biomedical strategies as moderators of mediated pathways to explore whether participants who reported use of a biomedical tool show a different causal process in intervention efficacy (AIM 4). Understanding mediators and moderators of existing behavioral HIV prevention interventions will help to inform how to pare down or ramp up interventions to their most effective elements and which subgroups and contexts must be targeted to produce briefer, cheaper, and more impactful interventions. These interventions could be used in combination with biomedical prevention strategies.!By also analyzing biomedical tools (i.e., nPEP use and male circumcision status) as potential moderators of mediated effects, we gain valuable insight into whether and which behavioral mechanisms must be targeted in interventions when these specific biomedical strategies are used. To meet our aims we will analyze data from studies using the “gold-standard” method for evaluating HIV prevention interventions. Specifically, we will use data from four different two-arm RCTs that were powered to test HIV incidence as the primary outcome. These RCTs tested the efficacy of behavioral HIV prevention interventions among men who have sex with men in the U.S., men and women in South Africa and Uganda, and people who inject drugs in Ukraine. Thus, the current proposal will analyze four unique intervention datasets from some of the most HIV-affected populations globally. Project Narrative In order to curb the global HIV epidemic, there is an urgent need to determine how, why, and for whom behavioral HIV prevention interventions work. Findings from the proposed research will provide an understanding of the mechanisms and conditions under which behavioral interventions are effective at reducing HIV incidence. The proposed research will help to inform how to pare down interventions to their most effective elements and which subgroups and contexts must be targeted to produce briefer, cheaper, and more impactful interventions for use in combination (behavioral and biomedical) HIV prevention programs.",Estimating Mediation and Moderation Effects in HIV Incidence Prevention Trials,9623496,R01DA042666,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Circumcision ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Masks ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Ramp ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Uganda ', ' Ukraine ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' behavior change ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Safe Sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' young woman ', ' substance use reduction ', ' reduction in substance use ', ' reduced substance use ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' Prevention trial ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,514112,0.028053427485121747
"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS Abstract/Summary Since the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, it has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings, contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years, CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, and the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment as well as the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized Implementation Science (IS) and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs, with emphasis on training for underrepresented minorities to diversify the field of HIV research. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will continue to develop and support the New England HIV Implementation Science Network, a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers that we established in 2014 to focus on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence, RI and New Haven, CT. Network activities will augment other efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to small cities/towns and other understudied communities. While focusing on the New England region, we will seek to become a national resource for IS research on the HIV epidemic, generating studies with findings of potential applicability to other highly impacted areas such as the southern parts of the U.S. We will focus on drivers of the epidemic and use the expertise of CIRA scientists to address the intertwined issues of substance use, mental health and stigma, and the impact of the current opioid epidemic on HIV risk and incidence. Our global research will also focus on advancing IS and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, thus supporting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals and priorities in the 2017 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV Research. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical and Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods. Each core will support and build capacity for IS research. We will embed Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) approaches into strategic planning and evaluation processes to optimize Center efficiency and services. Core specific and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project Narrative Recent advances in HIV science make ending the epidemic achievable, yet barriers to implementing proven strategies in practice persist. HIV disparities, rising incidence of HIV in young MSM, increasingly complex HIV co-morbidities, the opioid epidemic, the aging of the HIV population, and the need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public health. CIRA will provide a nexus for scientific inquiry and research collaborations to advance implementation of effective solutions to the epidemic in the U.S and globally.",Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS,9565824,P30MH062294,"['Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' Area ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Distance Learning ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Education Projects ', ' R25 Program ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' International ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' International AIDS ', ' Community Practice ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Clinical Services ', ' implementation research ', ' next generation ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' academic program ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer coaching ', ' education research ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' service providers ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Boston ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' E-learning ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' electronic learning ', ' eLearning ', ' digital learning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,P30,2018,1884978,0.04003735705383595
"Social media HIV prevention intervention for rural women drug users ABSTRACT The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based intervention for HIV prevention for a high-risk group of rural women in Appalachia. This study has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge on the use of social media to increase access to prevention interventions to reduce high-risk substance use and related health disparities among rural women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in Appalachia. Successfully accomplishing study aims will respond to a critical and unmet need to increase the reach and scope of prevention interventions using social media, as well as advance knowledge about the high-risk drug use behaviors of this underserved group. Considering the need for prevention interventions among this high-risk group and the popularity of Facebook, the purpose of this R34 proposal is to adapt an evidence-based HIV prevention intervention for social media delivery and to feasibility test through a randomized control trial with 60 high-risk rural women drug users. The following aims guide the proposed study: (1) Adapt the NIDA Standard for HIV prevention for delivery via Facebook; and (2) Examine the feasibility of the adapted intervention with high-risk rural women through a randomized control pilot. The proposed use of Facebook in this study is promising because it is a stable, widely used, cost-efficient platform that could be leveraged to increase access to critically needed HIV prevention education. This study presents an exciting opportunity to examine the use of Facebook as a technique to expand the reach of evidence- based preventions interventions for high-risk drug users who are not likely to engage in formal treatment. Findings from this study will inform development of the larger R01 which would allow examination of the effectiveness and sustainability of this HIV prevention intervention in understudied, high risk populations.

"Multilevel Influences on HIV and Substance use in a YMSM Cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) ages 16-29 are disproportionately affected by HIV, with high prevalence and incidence. While all other risk groups have declining rates of infection, dramatic increases are occurring among YMSM. YMSM are understudied, but preliminary research demonstrates that the HIV epidemic in YMSM forms a syndemic with drug use, violence, and mental health problems. The proposed study will build a dynamic dyadic-network cohort of 1,358 YMSM by hybridizing 2 existing cohorts of YMSM: Project Q2 (aged 20-24) and ChiGuys (aged 16-17). We will expand this unified cohort through the enrollment of serious sexual partners of core participants, thereby creating a dynamic dyadic network. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply a ""next generation"" multilevel model (Network-Individual-Resources model) to understand the syndemic among a cohort of YMSM and inform ""high-impact"" HIV prevention with this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1 is to understand how syndemics of substance use, HIV, STIs, mental disorders, and violence develop among YMSM using an accelerated longitudinal design. We will assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood, to describe the trajectories of syndemic development (including substance use) and use innovative statistical modeling to characterize different trajectories of syndemic development to predict youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. Aim 2 is to determine how dyadic processes influence HIV risk behaviors and transmission among YMSM by enrolling their serious sexual partners into the cohort. We will utilize dyadic data to identify which sexual partner and relationship factors are longitudinally related to unprotected sex and HIV/STI transmission across development. Phylogenetic analyses will link HIV transmissions within dyads to determine what behavioral, partner and dyadic factors predict such transmission. Aim 3 is to describe network and structural influences on syndemic development among YMSM. We will examine how sexual and drug use network structure Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM). The objective of this proposal is to build a large and innovative dynamic dyadic-network cohort of YMSM and their serious sexual partners in order to delineate multilevel influences on HIV and substance use. This cohort will serve as a strong resource platform for a wide range of future innovative research efforts and will inform behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention interventions for YMSM.

"Race-related Social Contextual Factors, Substance Use, and HIV ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are more likely to contract HIV than White MSM. Research thus far has been unable to account for the mechanisms driving this racial disparity, as HIV research has largely targeted individual risk factors, but Black MSM consistently report comparable or fewer of these behaviors than other MSM. In addition, little research examining racial disparities acknowledges that substance use and other HIV risk behaviors are socially and spatially dependent; thus, differences in network and venue affiliation may shape the risk environments and behaviors of YMSM of different racial groups, and may be key in understanding differences in HIV. Emerging research with Black MSM documents racial differences in the network, venue, and neighborhood affiliations of YMSM. These findings suggest that although rates of drug use and other HIV risk behaviors may be lower among Black YMSM than other racial groups, their consequences may be different due to the nature of the risk environments experienced by these young men. The overall objective of this project is to contribute to knowledge about structural mechanisms (e.g., stigma and discrimination) that shape these risk environments, which in turn shape consequences of substance use and other HIV risk behaviors for young Black MSM. However, appropriately interpreting the empirical data describing these social and cultural contexts (i.e., the structure of social, sex, drug, venue, and neighborhood affiliation networks) i problematic without the incorporation of the voices, lived experiences, and knowledge of participants. Therefore, the innovative mixed methods approach proposed by this project will guide the interpretation of network-level structures captured within an existing NIH-funded cohort of YMSM. Three phases will occur in which network and geographic data is visualized (Phase 1) and used to guide interviews with YMSM, leading to a theory of mechanisms and functions in this population (Phase 2), which will be subsequently tested using multilevel modeling (Phase 3). The overall project has two aims: 1) identify how networks, venues, and neighborhoods operate as risk environments that shape the consequences of substance use and HIV risk behavior for YMSM of different racial groups, and 2) identify how structural mechanisms, such as stigma and discrimination, influence the networks, venue attendance, and neighborhood affiliations of YMSM of different racial groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young Black men who have sex with men (YMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS despite having lower rates of important individual risk factors, and the mechanisms driving these racial disparities are unknown. This application aims to examine (1) how networks, venues, and neighborhoods function as risk environments that shape the consequences of risk behaviors, such as drug use, for YMSM of different racial groups as well as (2) structural mechanisms that shape racial differences in risk environments. The project incorporates the voices and lived experiences of YMSM to deepen understanding of social contextual factors associated with HIV and drug use, which has the potential to further our understanding of these important mechanisms as well as to provide a platform for the development of multilevel HIV/STI risk reduction interventions.","Race-related Social Contextual Factors, Substance Use, and HIV",9418039,F31DA040524,"['Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Socialization ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' illicit drug use ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' ']",NIDA,DE PAUL UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,28696,0.03241236723279134
"PHASTT: A mobile Personalized HIV and STI Testing Tool for young Black men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the U.S. have a disproportionally higher incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Unrecognized and untreated HIV and bacterial STIs are likely fueling these disparities as they exist despite similar individual risk behavior compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Known barriers to HIV and STI testing and treatment include low perceived risks, difficulty accessing providers, lack of engagement in regular healthcare, stigma, and concerns about confidentiality. The recent development of two new technologies, mobile health applications on hand-held devices (mHealth) and home testing for HIV and STIs, offer potential solutions to engage young Black MSM in HIV and STI testing and treatment. The major goals of this research are to test whether a combination of technology-based interventions to increase access and awareness can overcome barriers to engaging young Black MSM in HIV and STI testing and treatment; and to understand key features that enhance uptake. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unrecognized HIV and STIs are likely driving new HIV infections among young Black men who have sex with men in the U.S. With advances in mHealth and home HIV and STI testing strategies, we seek to understand facilitators and barriers to their use, and leverage these technology advances to increase HIV and STI testing frequency and facilitate linkage to care for these men.",PHASTT: A mobile Personalized HIV and STI Testing Tool for young Black men,9405620,K23MH104116,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Hand ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' career development ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' screening ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' online resource ', ' mHealth app ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,K23,2018,200540,0.03617156821453413
"Timely monitoring and response to HIV transmission networks for intensified prevention PROJECT SUMMARY  Tracking population-based HIV transmission dynamics is critical to design and monitor effective interventions. Despite widespread prevention, HIV incidence has failed to decline among some subgroups in the United States (US) including young men who have sex with men (MSM). Such disparities are notable in the Southern US which is at the epicenter of the national epidemic with the greatest burden in new and prevalent infections. Significant disparities in HIV infection exist based on race/ethnicity and risk behaviors, but also in geography; a higher proportion of cases are reported outside large urban areas compared to other regions.  Delineating HIV transmission dynamics in the Southern US can identify ongoing transmission networks or clusters where targeted prevention measures may be more impactful at reducing local incidence. However, the success of such measures requires timely identification and response to emerging or expanding clusters. Prospective phylogenetic analyses of HIV sequences integrated with epidemiologic and clinical surveillance data would facilitate the timely detection and monitoring of transmission networks. When combined with phylodynamic modeling, cluster expansion and transmission dynamics could be better predicted and the impact of interventions assessed.  Our overall hypotheses are: 1) Prospective phylogenetic cluster analysis allows timely identification of transmission chains not apparent through routine surveillance, 2) Persons identified in expanding clusters represent the leading edge of local transmission, i.e. recent infection, 3) Targeting prevention towards growing clusters will identify a higher proportion of recent infections and ultimately reduce incidence. These hypotheses will be addressed in North Carolina (NC) with three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe the demographic and geographical characteristics of HIV transmission involving persons with newly reported HIV infection using phylogenetic clustering, viral load, and risk behaviors; Aim 2: To assess HIV cluster expansion and inform phylodynamic models by integrating large-scale deep sequencing and contact networks involving cases with newly diagnosed HIV infection; Aim 3: To conduct a preliminary assessment of a cluster-directed partner services intervention to interrupt HIV transmission networks.  These aims will be addressed through a combination of strategies in collaboration with the NC Department of Health and Human Services. A statewide prospective, automated cluster analysis system (nextHIV) will be evaluated. Sequences from reference laboratories and deep sequencing of diagnostic specimens from public testing sites will be analyzed in near-real time. Clusters will be characterized with detailed epidemiological data including HIV viral loads and contact networks. A proof-of-concept, cluster-directed partner services intervention will be assessed in an 11 county region with high HIV burden. Phylodynamic and mathematical modeling will be used to assess cluster expansion and the potential impact of interventions.

"A pragmatic trial of two strategies for implementing an effective eHealth HIV prevention program Despite evidence that eHealth approaches can be effective in reducing HIV risk, their implementation requirements do not fit within established strategies for public health scale up—leaving it an open question as to how to bring these programs into practice. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address this need by developing and evaluating novel strategies for implementing eHealth HIV prevention programs. Keep It Up! (KIU!) is an online program proven to reduce HIV risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), including YMSM at elevated HIV risk due to behaviors (i.e., condomless sex, substance use) and demographics (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities). Strong evidence of effectiveness on behavioral and biomedical outcomes makes KIU! an ideal eHealth intervention for implementation science. Lessons learned will set the pathway for implementation of the many HIV eHealth programs currently undergoing efficacy testing.  Through formative research with community-based organizations (CBOs), health departments, the CDC, and researchers we have identified two pragmatic implementation strategies that we will evaluate and compare: Strategy 1: CBOs apply for, and are selected for, funding to deliver KIU! through their current HIV testing programs. Strategy 2 is a “direct-to-consumer” (DTC) model where centralized staff recruit participants nationally through online advertising campaigns and manage engagement. HIV/STI testing kits are shipped directly to YMSM and, upon documentation of an HIV negative test result, participants are delivered KIU!  Aim 1: Compare two implementation strategies using a cluster randomized trial. 75 counties with large YMSM populations will be randomized 2:1 to strategy 1 (CBO) or strategy 2 (DTC). KIU! will be delivered in each county for two years. In this cluster randomized trial, the unit of randomization is the county, with implementation and effectiveness outcome data collected from YMSM participants, CBOs, and the technology vendor. Our primary outcomes are public health impact (defined as reach X effectiveness) and cost per infection averted. We will also collect and report as secondary outcomes multiple metrics of reach, effectiveness, and implementation.  Aim 2: Examine adoption characteristics that explain variability in implementation outcomes. We will conduct mixed-methods research on the domains from the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to explain variability in implementation success. Data on CFIR characteristics will be collected through administrative data, and surveys and telephone interviews with key stakeholders.  We will also explore maintenance/sustainment of KIU! at the completion of the study. CBOs will be provided with materials to facilitate applying for external funding to continue to provide KIU! after study completion, including an Impact Tool to estimate local impact and costs. Through expert consultation we will examine models for ongoing sustainment of the DTC model. NIH has made a significant investment in developing and testing the efficacy of eHealth HIV prevention and care programs, but little is known about how to scale out and implement these programs once they are proven effective. The proposed study will lead the way in understanding implementation of eHealth interventions by testing two pragmatic strategies for delivering the Keep It Up! 3.0 program. Prior studies has demonstrated the effectiveness of Keep It Up! at reducing HIV risk among diverse young men who have sex with men, making it an ideal intervention for implementation science research.",A pragmatic trial of two strategies for implementing an effective eHealth HIV prevention program,9639451,R01MH118213,"['Adoption ', ' Advertising ', ' Behavior ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Ships ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vendor ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Test Result ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Equipoise ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' arm ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,1944720,0.004074842505205641

"Sexual Networks and HIV Transmission Clusters among Substance Using MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Heather A. Pines with the training and experience needed to facilitate her transition toward research independence in HIV prevention science. Dr. Pines' career development plan is designed to augment her training in epidemiology and allow her to: 1) develop expertise in social network analysis, 2) acquire skills in the use of genetic sequence analysis methods to identify HIV transmission clusters (i.e., individuals with genetically related HIV infections), 3) obtain further training in the ethical conduct of research, and 4) build the sklls necessary for a successful academic career. These training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, hands-on research, and mentoring from an interdisciplinary team of experts. Global disparities in resource allocation to HIV prevention services may limit the promise of recent breakthroughs in HIV prevention science, particularly among vulnerable substance using populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Innovative research that integrates social network and genetic sequence analysis methods to direct the delivery of biomedical HIV prevention strategies to individuals at greatest risk may help maximize their impact, control costs, and facilitate their implementation in the context of limited prevention resources. To this end, the overall objective of Dr. Pines' research project is to inform the development of comprehensive HIV prevention programs that leverage information on sexual network characteristics to interrupt HIV transmission among MSM in LMIC. The project will be embedded in a NIDA study among MSM in Tijuana, Mexico (R01DA037811; PI: Patterson), to capitalize on its research infrastructure and the expertise of its bi-national collaborators, and provide Dr. Pines with the opportunity to apply her newly acquired skills in social network and genetic sequence analysis. Pilot data suggest elevated rates of substance use and associated sexual risk behaviors may be driving the HIV epidemic among MSM in Tijuana. Thus, understanding the impact of substance use on sexual network characteristics and HIV transmission dynamics among MSM will be a major focus of this research. Specifically, the project aims to: 1) examine the influence of mean degree (number of male anal intercourse partners), the degree distribution, and sexual mixing patterns on overall sexual network structure among MSM; 2) identify individual, sexual network compositional, and socio-contextual factors associated with degree; and 3) determine whether sexual mixing patterns are associated with HIV transmission cluster membership. Findings from this project will be critical to Dr. Pines' development of an R01 proposal that integrates epidemiologic, social network, and genetic sequence analysis methods to advance HIV prevention science. These training and research activities will position Dr. Pines as the only researcher in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego with this unique skill set and enable her to develop an independent research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in HIV prevention science could significantly reduce HIV incidence worldwide.1 However, their promise may be limited among men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where HIV prevention resources for MSM populations are limited.2 The proposed training and research activities will enable the candidate to apply interdisciplinary research methods to investigate MSM sexual networks in Tijuana, Mexico in order to direct the delivery of scarce prevention resources and support the development of cost-effective,

"The Transnational Cohort: global HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transwomen bear a disproportionate burden of HIV worldwide, yet incidence is seldom measured and the determinants of acquiring infection are unknown. There is no HIV prevention intervention for transwomen with evidence of efficacy. Our project's goals are to create an international platform for HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen, obtain benchmarks for HIV incidence, and characterize causal factors for infection. We propose a cohort study of 1,100 transwomen in San Francisco, USA and São Paulo, Brazil where capacities are ready for longitudinal research. The cohort will measure HIV incidence and test hypotheses on HIV acquisition related to social and biomedical gender transition events and components of the Gender Affirmation, Behavioral Ecological, and Minority Stress models. Meanwhile, little is known about transwomen in China, the world's largest country, or sub- Saharan Africa, where the HIV epidemic is most severe. Basic epidemiological research on transwomen in these regions is overdue. We therefore also propose a cross-sectional survey of 250 transwomen in Nanjing, China and a formative assessment of transwomen in Windhoek, Namibia. In addition to obtaining the first estimates of HIV prevalence among transwomen in China and the first focused study of transwomen in sub-Saharan Africa, we will prepare these sites for future inclusion in the cohort. Our specific aims for the current proposal are: 1) to establish a population-based cohort of transwomen in San Francisco and São Paulo to measure HIV incidence; 2) to test hypotheses on social and biomedical gender transition events as causal factors in HIV acquisition among transwomen; 3) to initiate HIV prevention research for transwomen in China and sub-Saharan Africa. We will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS) for recruitment in order to approximate population-based samples for high external validity. Social media and mobile and web-based technologies will be used to increase cohort retention for high internal validity. HIV is only one health disparity experienced by transwomen. Transwomen are at increased risk for multiple mental health disorders and little is known about the impact of gender transition procedures on non-communicable diseases. The project will culminate in an international collaborative for rigorous HIV prevention research with incident endpoints and an infrastructure for ancillary studies on transwomen health issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Transnational Cohort: global HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen PROJECT NARATIVE The proposed study progressively builds an international platform for HIV prevention and health research for transwomen, including a longitudinal cohort in San Francisco, USA and São Paulo, Brazil, a cross-sectional survey in Nanjing, China, and formative investigation in Windhoek, Namibia.

"A couples-based approach to HIV prevention for transgender women and their male partners Transgender (`trans') women (i.e., individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity who were assigned male at birth) are among the populations at highest risk for HIV in the United States and worldwide. One of the most consistently reported contexts for HIV transmission among trans women is within a primary partnership with a non-transgender male. Despite the critical importance of primary partnerships for HIV prevention, the vast majority of HIV prevention studies and interventions for trans women have been individually-focused. For the past 10 years we have conducted research to identify intervention targets for reducing HIV transmission among trans women and their male partners using qualitative, survey, and intervention adaptation methodologies (R01DA018621; R34MH093232). Based on our conceptual and empirical understandings of HIV transmission risks among these couples, we recently developed and pilot tested the first known couples- based HIV prevention intervention for trans women and their male primary partner dyads (called “Couples HIV Intervention Program”; CHIP), which was feasible, acceptable, and produced significant reductions in sexual risk behavior compared to the control group. Based on our highly successful R34 findings, we propose to test the efficacy of the CHIP program in large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to reduce HIV risk among seroconcordant negative and serodiscordant couples. We will enroll racially diverse trans women and their male partners and randomize couples to either the CHIP intervention or an enhanced standard of care (SOC) control condition. Couples will be followed quarterly over 12-months. Analysis of study outcomes will utilize both individual- and dyadic-level data. Our primary outcome is a composite measure of risk for HIV transmission which encompasses validated behavioral indicators of HIV risk as well as biomedical confirmation of viral suppression and PrEP adherence. The CHIP intervention builds on years of formative work that targets interpersonal and social factors as mechanisms of HIV risk behavior among trans women and their male partners. If the CHIP intervention demonstrates efficacy in comparison to an enhanced SOC control condition, there will be support for implementing this approach within HIV prevention and care settings in order to reduce disparities in HIV transmission and acquisition among some of the highest priority HIV prevention populations. Transgender women (i.e., individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity who were assigned male at birth) are disproportionately affected by HIV and transmission risk has been attributed to a primary partnership with a non-transgender male. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of our promising couples-focused HIV prevention intervention to reduce HIV transmission risk among transgender women and their primary male partners by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies to help couples chose the most appropriate HIV prevention plan for their relationship.",A couples-based approach to HIV prevention for transgender women and their male partners,9620198,R01MH115765,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' Couples ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Joints ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Feminine ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Spottings ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' gender minority ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' Gender Sensitivity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,613634,0.03431720396452023
"Multilevel Comprehensive HIV Prevention for South African Adolescent Girls and Young Women ABSTRACT  Reducing new HIV and STI infections among South African (SA) adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) is global public health priority.1 SA has world's largest HIV epidemic,2,3 and SA AGYW acquire HIV at twice the rate of and seroconvert on average 5 – 7 years earlier than male peers.3 As new infections continue to outpace access to and availability of PrEP and ART, primary prevention remains the most viable strategy to stem new transmissions.1,4,5 SA efforts to prevent HIV transmission in youth focus mostly on individual-level behavior change,6-8 but AGYW's persistent HIV disparities are explained by broad social and structural inequities that shape and constrain HIV-risk behaviors.9-14 Comprehensive HIV prevention packages that are integrated, synergistic, and tailored to the local epidemiology and cultural context are likely to achieve and sustain maximum reductions in HIV-risk.15-22 Female caregivers (FC) are an untapped resource in the HIV prevention toolbox23,24 and offer a novel opportunity to strengthen AGYW prevention efforts. AGYW may also be change agents for their FC who want to be positive role models for AGYW, and thus, adopt HIV prevention behaviors, including HTC and PrEP. Guided by an ecological framework, our highly experienced multidisciplinary team will adapt (phase 1/UG3) and evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of (phase 2/UH3) IMARA, a multilevel, innovative, family-based HIV prevention program that targets individual, social, and structural drivers of risk to decrease HIV and STI incident infections, reduce risky sexual behavior, and increase HTC and PrEP uptake (where appropriate) in AGYW and FC. IMARA demonstrated a 45% reduction in incident STI at 12-month follow-up among black 14-18 year-old girls in the US, and increased HIV testing in FC. Pilot data with 71 AGYW and FC at the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation (DTHF; study site) confirm feasibility and acceptability of IMARA for the South African context. This study will be integrated into the adolescent-friendly services at DTHF in the Western Cape metropolitan area facilitating sustainability if effective. Using the ADAPT-ITT model, we will systematically tailor IMARA for the SA context and then conduct a 2-arm RCT with 300 15-19 year-old AGYW and FC. FC and AGYW will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month assessments, including testing for 3 STI. We will offer HTC and PrEP at each assessment and track uptake and linkage to care. AGYW and FC who test positive for a STI and/or HIV will receive free treatment at DTHF. We will collect data to determine the costs of IMARA. Analyses will compare AGYW and FC across the intervention and control programs on sexual risk taking, STI and HIV incidence, PrEP and HTC uptake, and theoretical mediators. The study answers an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combination HIV prevention packages for AGYW to achieve an AIDS-free generation. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE  Reducing new HIV and STI infections among South African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) is global public health priority.1 SA has world's largest HIV epidemic,2,3 and SA AGYW acquire HIV at twice the rate of and seroconvert on average 5 – 7 years earlier than male peers.3 15-19 year-old females account for over two thirds of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa,25 but only 15% know their HIV status.26 HIV mortality is rising among adolescents while decreasing for every other age group. As new infections continue to outpace access to and availability of PrEP and ART, primary prevention remains the most viable strategy to stem new transmissions.1,4,5 SA efforts to prevent HIV transmission in youth focus mostly on individual-level behavior change,6-8 but AGYW's persistent HIV disparities are explained by broad social and structural inequities that shape and constrain HIV-risk behaviors.9-14 Comprehensive HIV prevention packages that are integrated, synergistic, and tailored to the local epidemiology and cultural context are likely to achieve and sustain maximum reductions in HIV-risk.15-22 Female caregivers are an untapped resource in the HIV prevention toolbox23,24 and offer a novel opportunity to strengthen AGYW prevention efforts, particularly for uptake of new biomedical technologies like PrEP and HIV testing and counseling. AGYW may also be change agents for female caregivers who want to be positive role models for AGYW and thus, change their own behavior to practice HIV prevention. Establishing the cost- effectiveness of comprehensive HIV prevention packages will inform sustainment over time.27,28 This application will adapt and evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a family-based HIV prevention package for AGYW and female caregivers.

"Social Capital and Late HIV Diagnosis in the United States Project Summary DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate with competencies to become an independent NIH-funded researcher. The candidate’s long-term goal is to develop expertise in HIV prevention research and in community-level HIV prevention design, implementation, and evaluation. The proposed research in the K01 period is to investigate the role of community-level mechanisms linking social capital to late HIV diagnosis in the United States (US). Late HIV diagnosis remains a persistent public health threat in the US; it is associated with poorer survival among HIV+ persons, and drives onward HIV transmission in the community. The association among social capital, mediating mechanisms and HIV diagnosis remains under-investigated in the US. Aim 1: To characterize the longitudinal relationship between social capital and late HIV diagnosis across race/ethnicity. AIM 2: To investigate mechanisms (HIV testing and HIV stigma) in relation to the association between social capital and late HIV diagnosis across race/ethnicity. AIM 3: To develop and pilot social capital indicators, tailored to HIV prevention. The candidate will develop additional training through didactic coursework in 1) advanced quantitative and qualitative research methods including spatial econometrics, ethnography, and community based participatory research; 2) epidemiologic/clinical study design, and 3) intervention development. The candidate will be mentored by a team of internationally renowned experts in HIV prevention research, social determinants of health, causal inference, and HIV surveillance systems. Mentor and advisory committee members are from Harvard University, City University of New York, Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, Emory University, and University of Pennsylvania. Institutional resources available to the candidate include Harvard Center for AIDS Research and The Fenway Institute. Findings from the proposed research will provide the competencies and preliminary data for the candidate to write an R01 or R34 proposal to develop, implement, and evaluate a community-level social capital-based HIV prevention intervention. Project Narrative/ Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed research is to develop a deeper understanding on the role of social capital and late HIV diagnosis in the United States (US), and to better understand mechanisms that link the two. The project also aims to develop an indicator of social capital tailored to HIV prevention that is distinctly different from traditional indicators (e.g., social cohesion or collective efficacy). My research is significant because intervening at the stage of HIV diagnosis could have significant downstream impact on lowering community-level viral load suppression and reducing HIV incidence in key populations. Social capital is a modifiable determinant that can be generated and leveraged for community-level HIV prevention interventions in the US setting.",Social Capital and Late HIV Diagnosis in the United States,9467608,K01MH111374,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' American ', ' cohesion ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Committee Members ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Permission ', ' Authorization ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' public health relevance ', ' surveillance data ', ' social health determinants ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,153441,0.05637693376432812

"Unpacking the Mechanisms of Disparities for HIV-related Hypertension in African American and Asian Pacific American MSM The literature reveals that hypertension (HTN) is considerably higher among HIV-positive individuals than HIV-negative individuals. However, the systemic/individual determinants (including behavioral, clinical, macro- social, and psychosocial factors) for this health co-morbidity is not fully understood in the literature. To fill these scientific gaps, we propose to use a longitudinal design to systematically examine a systemic/individual approach -- modeling after the NIMHD’s “Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework” -- to examine and elucidate the multiple determinants of HTN observed in two ethnic-sexual men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV/AIDS. To that end, we will address three specific aims and hypotheses: Aim 1: To examine the association of macro-social determinants (i.e., homophobia, racial/ethnic discrimination), behavioral risk factors (e.g., substance misuse), and psychosocial factors (e.g., stress) with HTN among a cohort of African American or AA (200 AA in Philadelphia) and Asian Pacific Americans or APA (200 APA in Honolulu) MSM living with HIV -- We hypothesize that greater exposure to homophobia and racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with a greater prevalence of HTN among HIV-positive MSM. Aim 2: To determine the underlying systemic/individual determinants which account for the relationship between inflammation and HTN over time, given common forms of hypertension have been postulated to be immune mediated -- We hypothesize that the greater exposure to homophobia and racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (D-dimer, hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, P-selectin), where they mediate HTN among these men. Aims 3: To examine whether associations between these factors and health outcomes are moderated by coping and social support -- We hypothesize that greater social support would mitigate HTN among these men. This is the first study that uses systemic/individual and multi-disciplinary approaches to examine the impact of multiple determinants on HTN co-morbidity over time among AA and APA MSM living with HIV. Our multi-disciplinary team with expertise in HIV prevention science, clinical HIV medicine, ethnic-sexual MSM, and chronic diseases are uniquely positioned to address risk and protective factors of multiple influences of HTN co-morbidity over time among AA and APA MSM with HIV. By conceptually and empirically testing novel hypotheses, we will provide evidence of etiology and validated tools and measures that advance our understanding of mechanisms of disparities in HIV-related co-morbidities. Findings from this longitudinal observational study will inform the management of HIV and its HTN co-morbidity as a chronic disease, especially among the two disparity groups of MSM (AA and APA) who continue to bear the burden of health disparities. This study is guided by NIMHD’s conceptual framework to address multiple influences of health disparities on HTN comorbidity among HIV-positive MSM disparity populations. Our knowledge of the of systemic/individual determinants on “… the effect of HIV related co-morbidities on the complexity of HIV/AIDS diseases progression” is not fully understood. Given these scientific gaps, we propose to use a longitudinal design to systematically examine a systemic/individual approach -- modeling after the NIMHD’s “Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework” -- to examine and elucidate the multiple determinants including behavioral, clinical, macro-social, and psychosocial factors -- herein known as “systemic/individual determinants) of hypertension observed among a cohort of racial/ethnic (African American; Asian Pacific American) men who have sex with men living with HIV/AIDS in two metropolitan cities (Philadelphia and

"A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM Project Summary  Adolescent (ages 13-18) men who have sex with men (AMSM) experience a dramatic health disparity as they represent 2% of young people but account for almost 80% of HIV diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based HIV prevention programs. Implementation issues are critical as traditional HIV prevention delivery channels (community organizations, schools, parents), have significant limitations when it comes to AMSM. eHealth interventions represent an excellent modality for delivering AMSM-specific intervention material where youth “are.”  We should not continue to deliver the same intervention when a participant is not responding. Rather, stepped-care strategies increase in intensity to meet the needs of those who do not respond to a less intense intervention. Using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, we will evaluate the impact of a package of increasingly intensive interventions that have already shown evidence of efficacy with diverse adolescent and young adult MSM. The SMART design is an ideal approach to achieve the goals of this RFA because SMART designs mimic treatment decisions as they are made in real-world clinical settings. Collectively we brand our package of eHealth interventions as the SMART Program (Sexual Minority Adolescent Risk Taking). The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis. Public Health Relevance Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group among youth in the US and rates of infections are increasing, however, few HIV prevention programs have been developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve public health by establishing the effectiveness of an innovative, eHealth HIV prevention program for YMSM.",A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM,9431060,U01MD011281,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Magic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' implementation trial ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' community organizations ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' queer ', ' trial design ', ' adolescent MSM ', ' AMSM ', ' adolescent men who have sex with men ', ' recruit ', ' program costs ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2018,2839758,0.03355851604940887
"Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the happy consequences of HAART is that HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals now have available to them medications that allow them to reach old age. This means that we have the previously unexpected challenge of finding ways to support healthy aging in communities with high HIV prevalence rates. This challenge is likely to be particularly difficult among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to not only their very high background HIV prevalence rates but also the general dearth of proven models to promote healthy aging among older MSM. To meet this challenge, we need to develop health promotion programs that are more potent than the efficacious but time-limited effects found among HIV prevention interventions. Thus, we need to identify mechanisms to raise levels of intervention efficacy to support healthy aging beyond those that have already been tapped to support other health promotion efforts among MSM. In previous research by our group, we documented that specific resiliencies among MSM appear to have robust health-promoting properties. Resiliencies research conducted among aging MSM is an innovative agenda on several counts. The dominant approach to explaining patterns of health among MSM has been to study the effects of deficits in creating health disparities. While an emphasis on deficits is useful in explaining the life course trajectories of men who have multiple psychosocial health problems that result in poor health outcomes, this focus is less helpful in explaining the trajectories of te far larger proportion of MSM who have also experienced cultural marginalization and yet remain healthy well into later life. This application proposes the following aims to test a theory-based approach to identifying both deficits and resiliencies among aging MSM over six waves of data collection (N=1850) using an ongoing cohort study.1)To measure changes in prevalence rates of psychosocial health problems and resiliencies over time; 2)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with changes in substance use and other psychosocial health problems and to test whether resiliencies moderate the pathway to syndemics; and 3)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with better HIV-related outcomes and biomarkers among HIV-positive MSM and to test if resiliencies moderate the impact of syndemics on these same outcomes. By identifying the resiliencies already used by some aging MSM to stay healthy but which have yet to be incorporated in current health promotion efforts for MSM, we can progress to the testing of potentially efficacious health promotion programs to support healthy aging among MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although many older men who have sex with men (MSM) exhibit significant strengths that have helped them remain healthy well into later life, these strategies have not been well documented. In particular, the strengths, or resiliencies, of older MSM have not been carefully studied in terms of their ability to support health as men age. This study will use a theory-based approach to follow aging MSM in six waves of an ongoing cohort study to document how resiliencies moderate the effects of health risks to better explain patterns of health and illness among aging MSM.",Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men,9819760,R01MD010680,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' resilience ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older men ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' rate of change ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' The Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,78288,0.08162792676186323

"Timely monitoring and response to HIV transmission networks for intensified prevention PROJECT SUMMARY  Tracking population-based HIV transmission dynamics is critical to design and monitor effective interventions. Despite widespread prevention, HIV incidence has failed to decline among some subgroups in the United States (US) including young men who have sex with men (MSM). Such disparities are notable in the Southern US which is at the epicenter of the national epidemic with the greatest burden in new and prevalent infections. Significant disparities in HIV infection exist based on race/ethnicity and risk behaviors, but also in geography; a higher proportion of cases are reported outside large urban areas compared to other regions.  Delineating HIV transmission dynamics in the Southern US can identify ongoing transmission networks or clusters where targeted prevention measures may be more impactful at reducing local incidence. However, the success of such measures requires timely identification and response to emerging or expanding clusters. Prospective phylogenetic analyses of HIV sequences integrated with epidemiologic and clinical surveillance data would facilitate the timely detection and monitoring of transmission networks. When combined with phylodynamic modeling, cluster expansion and transmission dynamics could be better predicted and the impact of interventions assessed.  Our overall hypotheses are: 1) Prospective phylogenetic cluster analysis allows timely identification of transmission chains not apparent through routine surveillance, 2) Persons identified in expanding clusters represent the leading edge of local transmission, i.e. recent infection, 3) Targeting prevention towards growing clusters will identify a higher proportion of recent infections and ultimately reduce incidence. These hypotheses will be addressed in North Carolina (NC) with three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe the demographic and geographical characteristics of HIV transmission involving persons with newly reported HIV infection using phylogenetic clustering, viral load, and risk behaviors; Aim 2: To assess HIV cluster expansion and inform phylodynamic models by integrating large-scale deep sequencing and contact networks involving cases with newly diagnosed HIV infection; Aim 3: To conduct a preliminary assessment of a cluster-directed partner services intervention to interrupt HIV transmission networks.  These aims will be addressed through a combination of strategies in collaboration with the NC Department of Health and Human Services. A statewide prospective, automated cluster analysis system (nextHIV) will be evaluated. Sequences from reference laboratories and deep sequencing of diagnostic specimens from public testing sites will be analyzed in near-real time. Clusters will be characterized with detailed epidemiological data including HIV viral loads and contact networks. A proof-of-concept, cluster-directed partner services intervention will be assessed in an 11 county region with high HIV burden. Phylodynamic and mathematical modeling will be used to assess cluster expansion and the potential impact of interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV transmission continues in the Southern US despite comprehensive prevention.

"A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM Project Summary  Adolescent (ages 13-18) men who have sex with men (AMSM) experience a dramatic health disparity as they represent 2% of young people but account for almost 80% of HIV diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based HIV prevention programs. Implementation issues are critical as traditional HIV prevention delivery channels (community organizations, schools, parents), have significant limitations when it comes to AMSM. eHealth interventions represent an excellent modality for delivering AMSM-specific intervention material where youth “are.”  We should not continue to deliver the same intervention when a participant is not responding. Rather, stepped-care strategies increase in intensity to meet the needs of those who do not respond to a less intense intervention. Using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, we will evaluate the impact of a package of increasingly intensive interventions that have already shown evidence of efficacy with diverse adolescent and young adult MSM. The SMART design is an ideal approach to achieve the goals of this RFA because SMART designs mimic treatment decisions as they are made in real-world clinical settings. Collectively we brand our package of eHealth interventions as the SMART Program (Sexual Minority Adolescent Risk Taking). The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis. Public Health Relevance Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group among youth in the US and rates of infections are increasing, however, few HIV prevention programs have been developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve public health by establishing the effectiveness of an innovative, eHealth HIV prevention program for YMSM.",A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM,9654618,U01MD011281,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Magic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' implementation trial ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' community organizations ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' sexual minority ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' queer ', ' trial design ', ' adolescent men who have sex with men ', ' adolescent MSM ', ' AMSM ', ' recruit ', ' program costs ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2019,3213282,0.03355851604940887
"University of Pittsburgh MACS/WIHS CCS- Supplement Funds from NHLBI Contact PD/PI: RINALDO, CHARLES R PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching strategy of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) clinical research site (CRS) together with our collaborative clinical site at The Ohio State University (OSU) of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Woman’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS CCS) is to support, complement and accelerate the CCS unified scientific agenda (USA) by leveraging the strengths and scientific expertise of CRS investigators. We propose to continue to expand on our 35 years of extensive research on the natural history of HIV infection. The central hypothesis of this grant application is that, as men and women with chronic HIV infection age, they increase their risks for serious, life-shortening comorbidities beyond those of comparable age, uninfected persons, and this could differ between men and women. As directed by NIH RFA- HL-19-008, the CRS will provide robust and inclusive leadership focused on five specific aims of the USA, and targeted collaborative support for the five other aims, to improve our understanding of the epidemiologic, clinical, virologic, immunologic, and behavioral relationships of HIV infection to chronic comorbidities in men and women that represent the current HIV epidemic in the United States. The CRS will also contribute longitudinal data and biological specimens for collaborative research projects on HIV led by CCS and non-CCS investigators. This research is important to fulfill our mission of improving clinical management, increasing survival and controlling, preventing and curing HIV infection. The CRS will provide the most current and innovative epidemiological, clinical and laboratory methods and psychosocial research protocols to accomplish our 5 leadership specific aims. The Pitt/OSU CRS will be led by a triumvirate of MPIs and several CoIs with broad expertise needed to lead five highly specialized CCS USA Specific Aims (Aim 2: Pulmonary/Sleep [Morris]; Aim 3: Neurocognitive [Becker]; Aim 6: HIV/Pathogenesis [Macatangay]; Aim 7: Psychosocial [Stall]; Aim 9: Platform [Rinaldo, Kingsley]) and to provide insight for the 5 other Specific Aims (Aim 1: Cardiovascular [Kingsley, Martinson], Aim 4: Aging [Koletar], Aim 5: Cancer [Jenkins], Aim 8: Health Disparities [Krier], Aim 10: Career Development [Sluis- Cremer]. With this plan the Pitt/OSU CRS addresses the basic justification of the FOA, i.e., that the impact of HIV, its treatment, and the legacy of immune suppression need to be more fully understood to optimize the health of people living with HIV. Project Summary/Abstract Contact PD/PI: RINALDO, CHARLES R PROJECT NARRATIVE The scientific leadership and methods implemented by the Pitt/OSU CRS will enable the MACS/WIHS CCS to answer important questions relevant to treated HIV-infected MSM, the group with the highest HIV incidence in the US, and questions about the interaction of HIV and aging, important as the HIV-infected population shifts into older ages. The proposed research will provide information for development and administration of new interventions for HIV, as well as for the prevention of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining outcomes.

"Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men ABSTRACT From 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among MSM aged 13-24 years old more than doubled. There are stark racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections among YMSM; 13- 24 year old racial and ethnic minority MSM now represent a rapidly growing share of all new HIV infections. Although the likelihood of HIV acquisition is greater at older ages, many of the cognitive and behavioral risk factors that contribute to the risk of HIV infection rates develop in adolescence. As adolescent MSM (AMSM; 13-18 years old) begin to develop and express gender and sexual identities, to experiment and begin sexual behaviors, and to begin to establish a sense of self, there is the opportunity to parallel this period of growth with targeted, tailored interventions that equip AMSM with the life skills they need to reduce their vulnerability to HIV risk and to establish the life skills necessary to manage risk. We developed a mobile-friendly WebApp intervention focused on life skills training (iCON) across 16 topics, ranging from stigma and discrimination to sexual health, with links to local resources. In the proposed activities, we will adapt iCON for four U.S regions heavily impacted by HIV, and revise the content to include materials that are age-appropriate for 13 to 18 year- olds. Given the role that stigma and social isolation plays in the lives of many AMSM, we also propose to embed a peer-to-peer motivational interviewing component to iCON, allowing participants to access motivational interviewing counseling via VSee video-chat. With a large and diverse sample (n=500), we will test the efficacy of the intervention, now referred to as iCON+, on cognitive and behavioral HIV-related outcomes using a two-arm randomized control design. In addition, we examine whether structural characteristics in a region (e.g., race/ethnicity segregation, HIV prevalence) influence the efficacy of the proposed intervention. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Adapt a multilevel, online life skills intervention (iCON+) to address HIV vulnerability among AMSM living in four heavily impacted regions constituting diverse racial/ethnic and geographic areas (Chicago-Detroit; Atlanta-Washington, DC; Memphis- New Orleans; San Francisco-San Diego) in the US. (2) Test the efficacy of iCON+, as compared to a delayed intervention condition, to improve cognitive (e.g., comfort discussing sexuality; HIV prevention attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, behavioral intentions) and behavioral (e.g., condom use, HIV testing, PrEP use) factors using a prospective RCT design. (3) Examine the differential efficacy of iCON+ in improving psychosocial mediators (e.g., personal competency) associated with our outcomes and (4) Examine how socio-ecological determinants at the individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, urbanity) and regional (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, HIV prevalence) level are associated with iCON+'s efficacy. PROJECT RELEVANCE Consistent with the National HIV/AIDS Prevention Plan's call to reduce new HIV infections by intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities where HIV is most heavily concentrated, we propose to deliver and test a life skills intervention targeting the key domains that fuel HIV disparities among adolescent MSM in the United States. This RCT will yield important information regarding the delivery of a developmentally-appropriate HIV prevention program that reaches racial/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse sample of AMSM across four regions in the United States.",Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men,9647372,U01MD011274,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20

"A couples-based approach to HIV prevention for transgender women and their male partners Transgender (`trans') women (i.e., individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity who were assigned male at birth) are among the populations at highest risk for HIV in the United States and worldwide. One of the most consistently reported contexts for HIV transmission among trans women is within a primary partnership with a non-transgender male. Despite the critical importance of primary partnerships for HIV prevention, the vast majority of HIV prevention studies and interventions for trans women have been individually-focused. For the past 10 years we have conducted research to identify intervention targets for reducing HIV transmission among trans women and their male partners using qualitative, survey, and intervention adaptation methodologies (R01DA018621; R34MH093232). Based on our conceptual and empirical understandings of HIV transmission risks among these couples, we recently developed and pilot tested the first known couples- based HIV prevention intervention for trans women and their male primary partner dyads (called “Couples HIV Intervention Program”; CHIP), which was feasible, acceptable, and produced significant reductions in sexual risk behavior compared to the control group. Based on our highly successful R34 findings, we propose to test the efficacy of the CHIP program in large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to reduce HIV risk among seroconcordant negative and serodiscordant couples. We will enroll racially diverse trans women and their male partners and randomize couples to either the CHIP intervention or an enhanced standard of care (SOC) control condition. Couples will be followed quarterly over 12-months. Analysis of study outcomes will utilize both individual- and dyadic-level data. Our primary outcome is a composite measure of risk for HIV transmission which encompasses validated behavioral indicators of HIV risk as well as biomedical confirmation of viral suppression and PrEP adherence. The CHIP intervention builds on years of formative work that targets interpersonal and social factors as mechanisms of HIV risk behavior among trans women and their male partners. If the CHIP intervention demonstrates efficacy in comparison to an enhanced SOC control condition, there will be support for implementing this approach within HIV prevention and care settings in order to reduce disparities in HIV transmission and acquisition among some of the highest priority HIV prevention populations. Transgender women (i.e., individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity who were assigned male at birth) are disproportionately affected by HIV and transmission risk has been attributed to a primary partnership with a non-transgender male. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of our promising couples-focused HIV prevention intervention to reduce HIV transmission risk among transgender women and their primary male partners by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies to help couples chose the most appropriate HIV prevention plan for their relationship.",A couples-based approach to HIV

"Getting Off: A Theory-based mHealth Intervention for Methamphetamine-using MSM Abstract Methamphetamine (MA) use among men who have sex with men (MSM) is associated with increased rates of HIV prevalence and transmission, as well as substandard advancement along the HIV Prevention and Care Continua. MA use among MSM is deeply integrated into socio-sexual networks including the use of smartphone applications (“app”) and websites to find sexual partners. Given the growth of mobile health technology, it is no longer necessary or reasonable to limit MA treatment options to physical sites, clustered in urban areas, and administered using generic, non-tailored content. The project builds upon the established efficacy of our manualized MA-abuse treatment intervention, “Getting Off: A Behavioral Treatment Intervention for Gay and Bisexual Male Methamphetamine Users,” and the highly promising findings from our successful Stage I proof-of-concept study, to complete translation of Getting Off into a cross-platform (iOS and Android) app and assess the app’s efficacy and non-inferiority in a scientifically rigorous randomized trial. The Getting Off app, like the group-based intervention before it, will use the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Theory and Stages of Change to help MSM reduce or eliminate MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increase advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum (including uptake of HIV testing, pre-, and post- exposure prophylaxis [PEP/PrEP] and PrEP adherence and persistence for those who are HIV negative; ART uptake and adherence for those who are HIV positive). This project will 1) refine and enhance the first 8 sessions of the Getting Off MA-abuse treatment intervention developed in Stage I based on feasibility pilot test user feedback, 2) conduct formative research to develop the remaining 16 sessions of the Getting Off MA- abuse treatment intervention into a cross-platform computerized mobile app targeted to reduce MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increase advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum, and 3) conduct a RCT to evaluate reductions of MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increased advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum, using three approaches: a) Efficacy Trial – a two-arm RCT to determine intervention effects through comparison of the Immediate Delivery (ID; n=150) and Delayed Delivery (DD; n=150) arms; b) Efficacy Trial – an observed treatment effects analysis to compare pre/post data from the pooled ID and DD conditions (N=300); and, c) Non-inferiority Trial – a two-arm historical matched comparison design to evaluate the outcomes of the Getting Off app (ID + DD; N=300) relative to a matched sample of participants having previously attended the brick-and-mortar group-based Getting Off intervention (N~600; total N=900). The RCT uses repeated measures to assess participants at baseline, 1-, 2- (DD condition only), 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up. This study could have significant public health impact by greatly expanding access to effective, affordable, private, culturally competent and highly scalable MA treatment to this very high-risk population. Project Narrative Methamphetamine (MA) use among MSM is strongly associated with HIV infection and interrupted progression along the HIV Prevention and Care Continua. This study will complete the development and evaluation of an evidence-based, theory-driven, and culturally competent treatment app for MA-using MSM, designed to reduce or eliminate MA use and HIV sexual risks, increase uptake of HIV testing and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP), including PrEP adherence and persistence for those who are HIV negative, and increase retention in HIV care and adherence to ART for those who are HIV positive. Given the severe personal and public health consequences of MA use, the public health significance of this app is very high as it will provide this population with a tailored treatment opportunity that is easily accessible, affordable, private, and highly scalable.",Getting Off: A Theory-based mHealth Intervention for Methamphetamine-using MSM,9742448,R01DA045562,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"University of Pittsburgh MACS/WIHS CCS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching strategy of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) clinical research site (CRS) together with our collaborative clinical site at The Ohio State University (OSU) of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Woman’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS CCS) is to support, complement and accelerate the CCS unified scientific agenda (USA) by leveraging the strengths and scientific expertise of CRS investigators. We propose to continue to expand on our 35 years of extensive research on the natural history of HIV infection. The central hypothesis of this grant application is that, as men and women with chronic HIV infection age, they increase their risks for serious, life-shortening comorbidities beyond those of comparable age, uninfected persons, and this could differ between men and women. As directed by NIH RFA- HL-19-008, the CRS will provide robust and inclusive leadership focused on five specific aims of the USA, and targeted collaborative support for the five other aims, to improve our understanding of the epidemiologic, clinical, virologic, immunologic, and behavioral relationships of HIV infection to chronic comorbidities in men and women that represent the current HIV epidemic in the United States. The CRS will also contribute longitudinal data and biological specimens for collaborative research projects on HIV led by CCS and non-CCS investigators. This research is important to fulfill our mission of improving clinical management, increasing survival and controlling, preventing and curing HIV infection. The CRS will provide the most current and innovative epidemiological, clinical and laboratory methods and psychosocial research protocols to accomplish our 5 leadership specific aims. The Pitt/OSU CRS will be led by a triumvirate of MPIs and several CoIs with broad expertise needed to lead five highly specialized CCS USA Specific Aims (Aim 2: Pulmonary/Sleep [Morris]; Aim 3: Neurocognitive [Becker]; Aim 6: HIV/Pathogenesis [Macatangay]; Aim 7: Psychosocial [Stall]; Aim 9: Platform [Rinaldo, Kingsley]) and to provide insight for the 5 other Specific Aims (Aim 1: Cardiovascular [Kingsley, Martinson], Aim 4: Aging [Koletar], Aim 5: Cancer [Jenkins], Aim 8: Health Disparities [Krier], Aim 10: Career Development [Sluis- Cremer]. With this plan the Pitt/OSU CRS addresses the basic justification of the FOA, i.e., that the impact of HIV, its treatment, and the legacy of immune suppression need to be more fully understood to optimize the health of people living with HIV. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scientific leadership and methods implemented by the Pitt/OSU CRS will enable the MACS/WIHS CCS to answer important questions relevant to treated HIV-infected MSM, the group with the highest HIV incidence in the US, and questions about the interaction of HIV and aging, important as the HIV-infected population shifts into older ages. The proposed research will provide information for development and administration of new interventions for HIV, as well as for the prevention of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining

"PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Young Black MSM: Neighborhood and Network Determinants PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods, social and sexual networks, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence cross-sectionally and longitudinally among young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Chicago IL metropolitan statistical area (MSA) followed over two years. We will enroll 350 Black MSM in the proposed NIH-funded uConnect Neighborhoods and Networks Cohort Study to address the aims of the research. Eligibility requirements include: HIV-seronegative; self-report no restrictions to usual physical activity; no plans to move outside of Chicago IL MSA in the next two years; and willingness to complete a two-week GPS protocol at nine time-points over two years. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols we have used in our previous feasibility research projects, including studies among Black MSM. In this longitudinal study, three months after completing the initial 2-week GPS protocol, participants will carry the GPS device for an additional 2-weeks every three-months over the two-year study period—for a total of nine times. GPS activity space environment and social/sexual networks data at baseline could potentially influence PrEP outcomes over time. Also, multiple GPS measures and social/sexual networks (at different time points) can better capture the breadth of people’s exposure to neighborhood-level factors and dynamics in social/sexual networks. The proposed study will be the largest GPS study of HIV disparities in any MSM population and presents a remarkable opportunity to study environmental influences on HIV prevention. Findings from the proposed research will impact HIV prevention intervention activities. First, it will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increased community efforts to combat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender hate crime neighborhood rates through increased local police attention in high- crime locations may be an HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV health disparities. Second, from the GPS dataset we will know the travel patterns of Black MSM and therefore be able to identify optimal geographic locations for HIV prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions are seldom geographically targeted. Third, this research will facilitate the identification of geographic locations suitable for recruiting Black MSM in research studies, an improved method of venue- based sampling, in this understudied population. Fourth, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces changes or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. Changing risk environments would suggest that prevention requires significant dynamism and fluidity, as well as rapid change-detection feedback loops. Finally, our dynamic network analysis we propose will deepen understanding of the effects of social and sexual networks on HIV prevention behaviors and will improve network-based HIV prevention interventions.

"Multilevel Comprehensive HIV Prevention for South African Adolescent Girls and Young Women ABSTRACT  Reducing new HIV and STI infections among South African (SA) adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) is global public health priority.1 SA has world's largest HIV epidemic,2,3 and SA AGYW acquire HIV at twice the rate of and seroconvert on average 5 – 7 years earlier than male peers.3 As new infections continue to outpace access to and availability of PrEP and ART, primary prevention remains the most viable strategy to stem new transmissions.1,4,5 SA efforts to prevent HIV transmission in youth focus mostly on individual-level behavior change,6-8 but AGYW's persistent HIV disparities are explained by broad social and structural inequities that shape and constrain HIV-risk behaviors.9-14 Comprehensive HIV prevention packages that are integrated, synergistic, and tailored to the local epidemiology and cultural context are likely to achieve and sustain maximum reductions in HIV-risk.15-22 Female caregivers (FC) are an untapped resource in the HIV prevention toolbox23,24 and offer a novel opportunity to strengthen AGYW prevention efforts. AGYW may also be change agents for their FC who want to be positive role models for AGYW, and thus, adopt HIV prevention behaviors, including HTC and PrEP. Guided by an ecological framework, our highly experienced multidisciplinary team will adapt (phase 1/UG3) and evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of (phase 2/UH3) IMARA, a multilevel, innovative, family-based HIV prevention program that targets individual, social, and structural drivers of risk to decrease HIV and STI incident infections, reduce risky sexual behavior, and increase HTC and PrEP uptake (where appropriate) in AGYW and FC. IMARA demonstrated a 45% reduction in incident STI at 12-month follow-up among black 14-18 year-old girls in the US, and increased HIV testing in FC. Pilot data with 71 AGYW and FC at the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation (DTHF; study site) confirm feasibility and acceptability of IMARA for the South African context. This study will be integrated into the adolescent-friendly services at DTHF in the Western Cape metropolitan area facilitating sustainability if effective. Using the ADAPT-ITT model, we will systematically tailor IMARA for the SA context and then conduct a 2-arm RCT with 300 15-19 year-old AGYW and FC. FC and AGYW will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month assessments, including testing for 3 STI. We will offer HTC and PrEP at each assessment and track uptake and linkage to care. AGYW and FC who test positive for a STI and/or HIV will receive free treatment at DTHF. We will collect data to determine the costs of IMARA. Analyses will compare AGYW and FC across the intervention and control programs on sexual risk taking, STI and HIV incidence, PrEP and HTC uptake, and theoretical mediators. The study answers an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combination HIV prevention packages for AGYW to achieve an AIDS-free generation. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE  Reducing new HIV and STI infections among South African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) is global public health priority.1 SA has world's largest HIV epidemic,2,3 and SA AGYW acquire HIV at twice the rate of and seroconvert on average 5 – 7 years earlier than male peers.3 15-19 year-old females account for over two thirds of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa,25 but only 15% know their HIV status.26 HIV mortality is rising among adolescents while decreasing for every other age group. As new infections continue to outpace access to and availability of PrEP and ART, primary prevention remains the most viable strategy to stem new transmissions.1,4,5 SA efforts to prevent HIV transmission in youth focus mostly on individual-level behavior change,6-8 but AGYW's persistent HIV disparities are explained by broad social and structural inequities that shape and constrain HIV-risk behaviors.9-14 Comprehensive HIV prevention packages that are integrated, synergistic, and tailored to the local epidemiology and cultural context are likely to achieve and sustain maximum reductions in HIV-risk.15-22 Female caregivers are an untapped resource in the HIV prevention toolbox23,24 and offer a novel opportunity to strengthen AGYW prevention efforts, particularly for uptake of new biomedical technologies like PrEP and HIV testing and counseling. AGYW may also be change agents for female caregivers who want to be positive role models for AGYW and thus, change their own behavior to practice HIV prevention. Establishing the cost- effectiveness of comprehensive HIV prevention packages will inform sustainment over time.27,28 This application will adapt and evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a family-based HIV prevention package for AGYW and female caregivers.

"The Transnational Cohort: global HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transwomen bear a disproportionate burden of HIV worldwide, yet incidence is seldom measured and the determinants of acquiring infection are unknown. There is no HIV prevention intervention for transwomen with evidence of efficacy. Our project's goals are to create an international platform for HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen, obtain benchmarks for HIV incidence, and characterize causal factors for infection. We propose a cohort study of 1,100 transwomen in San Francisco, USA and São Paulo, Brazil where capacities are ready for longitudinal research. The cohort will measure HIV incidence and test hypotheses on HIV acquisition related to social and biomedical gender transition events and components of the Gender Affirmation, Behavioral Ecological, and Minority Stress models. Meanwhile, little is known about transwomen in China, the world's largest country, or sub- Saharan Africa, where the HIV epidemic is most severe. Basic epidemiological research on transwomen in these regions is overdue. We therefore also propose a cross-sectional survey of 250 transwomen in Nanjing, China and a formative assessment of transwomen in Windhoek, Namibia. In addition to obtaining the first estimates of HIV prevalence among transwomen in China and the first focused study of transwomen in sub-Saharan Africa, we will prepare these sites for future inclusion in the cohort. Our specific aims for the current proposal are: 1) to establish a population-based cohort of transwomen in San Francisco and São Paulo to measure HIV incidence; 2) to test hypotheses on social and biomedical gender transition events as causal factors in HIV acquisition among transwomen; 3) to initiate HIV prevention research for transwomen in China and sub-Saharan Africa. We will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS) for recruitment in order to approximate population-based samples for high external validity. Social media and mobile and web-based technologies will be used to increase cohort retention for high internal validity. HIV is only one health disparity experienced by transwomen. Transwomen are at increased risk for multiple mental health disorders and little is known about the impact of gender transition procedures on non-communicable diseases. The project will culminate in an international collaborative for rigorous HIV prevention research with incident endpoints and an infrastructure for ancillary studies on transwomen health issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Transnational Cohort: global HIV epidemiology and prevention research for transwomen PROJECT NARATIVE The proposed study progressively builds an international platform for HIV prevention and health research for transwomen, including a longitudinal cohort in San Francisco, USA and São Paulo, Brazil, a cross-sectional survey in Nanjing, China, and formative investigation in Windhoek, Namibia. The longitudinal study will measure HIV incidence and identify causes of HIV acquisition. The studies in China and sub-Saharan Africa will provide basic epidemiological data and build capacity for future transwomen health research.

Tucker, an Associate Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), submits this application for a K24 Mid-Career Award. Dr. Tucker is a nationally recognized thought leader on HIV testing and crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is the process of having a group of non-experts and experts develop a solution, then implement the solution in the community. In this application, he proposes to develop skills that will serve his future work in this significant area of research, including behavioral economics, participatory interventions, and strategies for effective leadership. Candidate: Dr. Tucker has been a highly productive HIV clinical researcher and has developed a substantial HIV research program in China. He has 208 peer-reviewed publications, including several research studies that have informed national and global policy. Dr. Tucker is PI on two NIAID R01 research grants and one D43 Global Infectious Diseases Training Grant. He is Chair of the Burroughs Wellcome Fund/American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Postdoctoral Fellowship Committee. As Director of the UNC-South China STD Research Training Center, Dr. Tucker has helped to build capacity for HIV and STD co-infection research and training in China. He has served as primary mentor for many new clinician investigators who have subsequently become successful independent HIV researchers. Mentoring Plan/Environment: This application will leverage the extensive training resources at UNC Project- China in Guangzhou, China and at UNC. In China, the UNC-South China STD Research Training Center and the SESH research team at Southern Medical University provide unique opportunities for research training.

"Los Angeles CRS for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study Abstract The UCLA Clinical Research Site (CRS) of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) / Women's Interagency  ‐ ‐ ‐‐ HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (CCS) proposes to continue to document clinical, immunologic,  ‐‐ ‐ physiologic, behavioral, virologic, genetic and psychosocial changes in HIV infected and uninfected men who ‐‐ have sex with men (MSM). This includes proposed studies to document these changes in MSM recruited  ‐ previously, as well as plans to recruit new untreated and recently treated HIV infected MSM (primarily African ‐‐ and Hispanic Americans), to maintain the cohort. The UCLA CRS will provide leadership and participation in the working groups, CCS wide and local studies and research publications, as well as collaborative multi  ‐ cohort studies, as it has since the inception of the MACS 35 years ago. The UCLA CRS has recruited a large team of early career and established co investigators from a wide range of disciplines. These investigators have developed, and are continuing to develop, innovative proposals to advance our understanding of co- morbid conditions that arise in people living with treated HIV infection, as well as the pathophysiology, immunology, genetics a‐nd bio-behavioral characteristics of treated and untreated HIV infection. The breadth, enthusiasm, experience and innovation of the UCLA CRS investigators, combined with the experience and commitment of the long term staff, and our leadership of several areas of HIV/AIDs research, will continue to play an invaluable role in the success of the CCS over the next seven years.

"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS Abstract/Summary Since the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, it has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings, contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years, CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, and the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment as well as the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized Implementation Science (IS) and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs, with emphasis on training for underrepresented minorities to diversify the field of HIV research. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will continue to develop and support the New England HIV Implementation Science Network, a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers that we established in 2014 to focus on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence, RI and New Haven, CT. Network activities will augment other efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to small cities/towns and other understudied communities. While focusing on the New England region, we will seek to become a national resource for IS research on the HIV epidemic, generating studies with findings of potential applicability to other highly impacted areas such as the southern parts of the U.S. We will focus on drivers of the epidemic and use the expertise of CIRA scientists to address the intertwined issues of substance use, mental health and stigma, and the impact of the current opioid epidemic on HIV risk and incidence. Our global research will also focus on advancing IS and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, thus supporting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals and priorities in the 2017 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV Research. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical and Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods. Each core will support and build capacity for IS research. We will embed Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) approaches into strategic planning and evaluation processes to optimize Center efficiency and services. Core specific and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project Narrative Recent advances in HIV science make ending the epidemic achievable, yet barriers to implementing proven strategies in practice persist. HIV disparities, rising incidence of HIV in young MSM, increasingly complex HIV co-morbidities, the opioid epidemic, the aging of the HIV population, and the need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public health.

"Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men  The overarching goal of this proposed study is to leverage existing and ongoing data to examine the role of sexual behavior stigma on access to HIV healthcare as well as sexual and mental health outcomes among men who have sex with men (MSM). Worldwide MSM are a key population that bear a disproportionate burden of HIV with high prevalence and incidence yet they have low uptake and/or access to treatment and prevention. Consistent with NIH HIV/AIDS research priorities, the proposed project aims to reduce health disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes by addressing stigma towards MSM in the context of intersecting stigmas and potentially modifiable mediators (e.g., depression). In particular, validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed to effectively measure stigma-related interventions and to better understand the mechanisms of how stigma potentiates HIV risks among this key population. We propose to leverage existing data collected from over 15,000 MSM across 7 different Sub-Saharan African nations, the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS), the UCLA mSTUDY, and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 078 study on Enhancing Recruitment, Linkage to Care and Treatment for HIV-Infected MSM in the US. The specific aims of the work are: Aim 1) Develop validated measures used to assess sexual behavior stigma among MSM using factor analysis and validity and reliability testing. This will result in finalized stigma metrics and recommendations for integration of MSM stigma items that can be used in future studies. Aim 2) Identify specific mediated associations between stigma and HIV-related outcomes using structural equation modeling. In addition, test for intersectionality of multiple forms of stigma (e.g., gender, HIV status, race/ethnicity) using an inter- and intra-categorical approach. The delivered outcomes will include quantified associations of sexual behavior stigma with HIV-related outcomes that can be used to inform HIV intervention planning by setting feasible targets for stigma mitigation interventions. Aim 3) Include final validated stigma metrics in an upcoming cycle of AMIS and bio-validate the stigma metrics. Bio-validation will consist of testing associations of sexual behavior stigma with testing positive for sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia and gonorrhea), and with chronic stress measured using telomere DNA length. Participants will self-collect urine, rectal, and saliva specimens using home-based STI test kits. Overall, the proposed study will result in a thorough assessment of a sexual behavior stigma scale for MSM and how it operates comparatively with other types of stigma. The validated stigma metrics will provide recommendations for future studies that seek to measure stigma and its relation to HIV among this key population. The World Health Organization, UNAIDS, and the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy have collectively called for the need to reduce stigma towards MSM as a vital component of an effective HIV response. Consistent and validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed in the context of multiple intersecting stigmas; therefore, the proposed research project will develop, test, and validate sexual behavior stigma metrics using existing and ongoing data collected across Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. Using bio- specimens collected in the American Men's Internet Survey, the proposed project will additionally contribute to the understanding of relationships between stigma and risk for chronic stress and sexually transmitted infections among this key population.",Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men ,9657830,R01MH110358,"['Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Population Programs ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rectal ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Research Priority ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' comparative ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' HIV prevention trials network ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' sexual role ', ' intersectionality ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,635132,0.03682825900432039
"A Multilevel Network Model of Drug Use and HIV Racial Disparities in Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Black men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young MSM, are disproportionately affected by HIV, with an annual incidence higher than any other age or race group. Despite this increasing epidemic, few studies have focused on MSM nor accounted for these disparities. The research that has examined disparities in MSM has been focused on understanding individual-level behavior, but this has been inadequate to explain HIV racial disparities. Additionally, network research is increasingly a priority area in HIV research due to the disease's high transmission dependence on drug and sexual network dynamics. However, network descriptions alone are also inadequate without considering the interplay of individual and contextual factors. Instead, it has been suggested that a broader systems-level perspective may be necessary as several interacting individual, network, and contextual differences may account for the increased epidemic in Black MSM populations. Due to this call for a systems-level perspective in understanding and preventing HIV infection, this grant seeks to advance understandings of HIV racial disparities in MSM by examining individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors within a multilevel network model. This model will be tested within an exceptional U01 NIDA-funded cohort of 1,200 diverse Chicago YMSM (PI: Primary Mentor Mustanski), which is collecting original multilevel (biologic, individual, dyadic, network) data. Utilizing methods developed within the applicant's R03 Project, YMSM will complete social (social, sexual, drug) and contextual (neighborhood & venue) network interviews. Building the study into the U01 cohort allows the current project to benefit from the strong infrastructure and resources of the U01, fortifies this project's feasibility, and provides unique opportunities to expand the aims of the U01. Data from this comprehensive longitudinal multilevel dataset will be used to build and validate a model of social contextual influences on racial disparities in HIV through innovative analyses and methods that account for the complex dynamics of HIV transmission and racial disparities. The overall project has two aims: 1) Identify social contextua factors (i.e., social relational and social contextual) which contribute to racial disparities in HV and 2) Examine the interplay of individual, sexual network, and social contextual factors in racial disparities in HIV. Additional sub- aims include: A) Compare the contribution of each level of analysis to racial disparities in HIV using innovative Multiple-Membership Multiple-Classification Models (MMMC) and B) Understand and validate the relations of individual, sexual network, and social contextual structures and attributes to racial disparities in HIV with ERGM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YMSM) have an alarming HIV/AIDS prevalence, yet the mechanisms driving these disparities are unknown. This proposal aims to examine social contextual influences on HIV disparities by building and validating a multilevel model and examining individual, network, and social contextual factors associated with HIV.",A Multilevel Network Model of Drug Use and HIV Racial Disparities in Men,9627963,K08DA037825,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Testing ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' model building ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2019,175527,0.03665592128056634

"Unpacking the Mechanisms of Disparities for HIV-related Hypertension in African American and Asian Pacific American MSM The literature reveals that hypertension (HTN) is considerably higher among HIV-positive individuals than HIV-negative individuals. However, the systemic/individual determinants (including behavioral, clinical, macro- social, and psychosocial factors) for this health co-morbidity is not fully understood in the literature. To fill these scientific gaps, we propose to use a longitudinal design to systematically examine a systemic/individual approach -- modeling after the NIMHD’s “Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework” -- to examine and elucidate the multiple determinants of HTN observed in two ethnic-sexual men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV/AIDS. To that end, we will address three specific aims and hypotheses: Aim 1: To examine the association of macro-social determinants (i.e., homophobia, racial/ethnic discrimination), behavioral risk factors (e.g., substance misuse), and psychosocial factors (e.g., stress) with HTN among a cohort of African American or AA (200 AA in Philadelphia) and Asian Pacific Americans or APA (200 APA in Honolulu) MSM living with HIV -- We hypothesize that greater exposure to homophobia and racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with a greater prevalence of HTN among HIV-positive MSM. Aim 2: To determine the underlying systemic/individual determinants which account for the relationship between inflammation and HTN over time, given common forms of hypertension have been postulated to be immune mediated -- We hypothesize that the greater exposure to homophobia and racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (D-dimer, hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, P-selectin), where they mediate HTN among these men. Aims 3: To examine whether associations between these factors and health outcomes are moderated by coping and social support -- We hypothesize that greater social support would mitigate HTN among these men. This is the first study that uses systemic/individual and multi-disciplinary approaches to examine the impact of multiple determinants on HTN co-morbidity over time among AA and APA MSM living with HIV. Our multi-disciplinary team with expertise in HIV prevention science, clinical HIV medicine, ethnic-sexual MSM, and chronic diseases are uniquely positioned to address risk and protective factors of multiple influences of HTN co-morbidity over time among AA and APA MSM with HIV. By conceptually and empirically testing novel hypotheses, we will provide evidence of etiology and validated tools and measures that advance our understanding of mechanisms of disparities in HIV-related co-morbidities. Findings from this longitudinal observational study will inform the management of HIV and its HTN co-morbidity as a chronic disease, especially among the two disparity groups of MSM (AA and APA) who continue to bear the burden of health disparities. This study is guided by NIMHD’s conceptual framework to address multiple influences of health disparities on HTN comorbidity among HIV-positive MSM disparity populations. Our knowledge of the of systemic/individual determinants on “… the effect of HIV related co-morbidities on the complexity of HIV/AIDS diseases progression” is not fully understood. Given these scientific gaps, we propose to use a longitudinal design to systematically examine a systemic/individual approach -- modeling after the NIMHD’s “Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework” -- to examine and elucidate the multiple determinants including behavioral, clinical, macro-social, and psychosocial factors -- herein known as “systemic/individual determinants) of hypertension observed among a cohort of racial/ethnic (African American; Asian Pacific American) men who have sex with men living with HIV/AIDS in two metropolitan cities (Philadelphia and

"A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM Project Summary  Adolescent (ages 13-18) men who have sex with men (AMSM) experience a dramatic health disparity as they represent 2% of young people but account for almost 80% of HIV diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based HIV prevention programs. Implementation issues are critical as traditional HIV prevention delivery channels (community organizations, schools, parents), have significant limitations when it comes to AMSM. eHealth interventions represent an excellent modality for delivering AMSM-specific intervention material where youth “are.”  We should not continue to deliver the same intervention when a participant is not responding. Rather, stepped-care strategies increase in intensity to meet the needs of those who do not respond to a less intense intervention. Using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, we will evaluate the impact of a package of increasingly intensive interventions that have already shown evidence of efficacy with diverse adolescent and young adult MSM. The SMART design is an ideal approach to achieve the goals of this RFA because SMART designs mimic treatment decisions as they are made in real-world clinical settings. Collectively we brand our package of eHealth interventions as the SMART Program (Sexual Minority Adolescent Risk Taking). The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis. Public Health Relevance Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group among youth in the US and rates of infections are increasing, however, few HIV prevention programs have been developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve public health by establishing the effectiveness of an innovative, eHealth HIV prevention program for YMSM.",A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM,10022579,U01MD011281,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Magic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' implementation trial ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' community organizations ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' sexual minority ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' queer ', ' trial design ', ' adolescent men who have sex with men ', ' adolescent MSM ', ' AMSM ', ' recruit ', ' program costs ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2019,125000,0.03355851604940887
"HIV intervention models for criminal justice involved substance-using Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such ""shocks"" lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations.

"Structural Stigma and HIV Prevention Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. At current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Extant research has largely focused on identifying individual- and interpersonal-level risk factors for HIV infection among GBM; however, accumulating evidence also points to structural determinants of HIV outcomes in this population. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that structural stigma—defined as societal- level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the resources and opportunities of stigmatized individuals—is associated with adverse health outcomes, including HIV risk, among GBM. For example, pilot data from our research group showed that 4,098 GBM living in states with high levels of structural stigma—measured with a composite index of discriminatory state laws and negative social attitudes towards homosexuality—had lower levels of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge and use, lower odds of HIV testing, and greater odds of condomless anal sex compared with those living in low structural stigma states. While promising, the few existing studies of structural stigma and HIV outcomes among GBM have been limited by a reliance on cross-sectional designs, a small number of structural covariates, little attention to mediators/moderators of the structural stigma-HIV risk association, and non-probability samples of GBM. To address these limitations, we will create a new, prospective, nationally representative study of HIV-uninfected/unknown status GBM who will be followed for 5 waves of data collection over a 24-month period (N=500). With a representative sample of participants from across the U.S., we will have substantial variation in the social context surrounding GBM. This will be the first and largest prospective study with a nationally representative sample of GBM specifically designed to: (1) examine whether structural forms of stigma related to sexual identity increase vulnerability to adverse HIV prevention outcomes (e.g., less HIV testing and PEP/PrEP use); (2) identify mutable mechanisms (e.g., self-stigma, depressive symptoms, safer-sex self efficacy) through which structural stigma influences HIV outcomes; and (3) evaluate resilience processes (e.g., LGB community connectedness) that may mitigate the negative effects of structural stigma on HIV outcomes. In the final phase of the project, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 key informants and 30 GBM. We will use data from these interviews, together with the quantitative results, to inform the development of multi-level HIV intervention strategies that are maximally responsive to the structural conditions in which GBM are embedded. We have assembled a team of experts in structural stigma, HIV prevention among GBM, qualitative research, and survey research with nationally representative samples to address our study aims. This project stands to make important contributions to research on reducing disparities in the incidence of HIV infections among GBM, identified as a high NIH HIV/AIDS research priority. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the United States; further, recent estimates suggest that at current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Research into the underlying factors that can explain this risk—especially at the structural level, which has been relatively understudied—constitutes a critical area for public health. The goal of this proposed research is to evaluate structural determinants of HIV prevention outcomes among a nationally representative cohort of GBM, which will provide essential information that can be used to inform the development of effective HIV preventive strategies that address the social conditions surrounding the general population of GBM.",Structural Stigma and HIV Prevention Outcomes,9695012,R01MH112384,"['Affect ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexuality ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Services ', ' Safe Sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' family support ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,581891,0.04717313603330204
"Social media HIV prevention intervention for rural women drug users ABSTRACT The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based intervention for HIV prevention for a high-risk group of rural women in Appalachia. This study has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge on the use of social media to increase access to prevention interventions to reduce high-risk substance use and related health disparities among rural women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in Appalachia. Successfully accomplishing study aims will respond to a critical and unmet need to increase the reach and scope of prevention interventions using social media, as well as advance knowledge about the high-risk drug use behaviors of this underserved group. Considering the need for prevention interventions among this high-risk group and the popularity of Facebook, the purpose of this R34 proposal is to adapt an evidence-based HIV prevention intervention for social media delivery and to feasibility test through a randomized control trial with 60 high-risk rural women drug users. The following aims guide the proposed study: (1) Adapt the NIDA Standard for HIV prevention for delivery via Facebook; and (2) Examine the feasibility of the adapted intervention with high-risk rural women through a randomized control pilot. The proposed use of Facebook in this study is promising because it is a stable, widely used, cost-efficient platform that could be leveraged to increase access to critically needed HIV prevention education. This study presents an exciting opportunity to examine the use of Facebook as a technique to expand the reach of evidence- based preventions interventions for high-risk drug users who are not likely to engage in formal treatment. Findings from this study will inform development of the larger R01 which would allow examination of the effectiveness and sustainability of this HIV prevention intervention in understudied, high risk populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based HIV prevention education for high-risk, underserved rural women in Appalachia. This study has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge on the use of social media to increase access to prevention interventions to reduce high-risk substance use and related health disparities among rural women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in Appalachia.

"Unpacking the Mechanisms of Disparities for HIV-related Hypertension in African American and Asian Pacific American MSM The literature reveals that hypertension (HTN) is considerably higher among HIV-positive individuals than HIV-negative individuals. However, the systemic/individual determinants (including behavioral, clinical, macro- social, and psychosocial factors) for this health co-morbidity is not fully understood in the literature. To fill these scientific gaps, we propose to use a longitudinal design to systematically examine a systemic/individual approach -- modeling after the NIMHD’s “Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework” -- to examine and elucidate the multiple determinants of HTN observed in two ethnic-sexual men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV/AIDS. To that end, we will address three specific aims and hypotheses: Aim 1: To examine the association of macro-social determinants (i.e., homophobia, racial/ethnic discrimination), behavioral risk factors (e.g., substance misuse), and psychosocial factors (e.g., stress) with HTN among a cohort of African American or AA (200 AA in Philadelphia) and Asian Pacific Americans or APA (200 APA in Honolulu) MSM living with HIV -- We hypothesize that greater exposure to homophobia and racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with a greater prevalence of HTN among HIV-positive MSM. Aim 2: To determine the underlying systemic/individual determinants which account for the relationship between inflammation and HTN over time, given common forms of hypertension have been postulated to be immune mediated -- We hypothesize that the greater exposure to homophobia and racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (D-dimer, hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, P-selectin), where they mediate HTN among these men. Aims 3: To examine whether associations between these factors and health outcomes are moderated by coping and social support -- We hypothesize that greater social support would mitigate HTN among these men. This is the first study that uses systemic/individual and multi-disciplinary approaches to examine the impact of multiple determinants on HTN co-morbidity over time among AA and APA MSM living with HIV. Our multi-disciplinary team with expertise in HIV prevention science, clinical HIV medicine, ethnic-sexual MSM, and chronic diseases are uniquely positioned to address risk and protective factors of multiple influences of HTN co-morbidity over time among AA and APA MSM with HIV. By conceptually and empirically testing novel hypotheses, we will provide evidence of etiology and validated tools and measures that advance our understanding of mechanisms of disparities in HIV-related co-morbidities. Findings from this longitudinal observational study will inform the management of HIV and its HTN co-morbidity as a chronic disease, especially among the two disparity groups of MSM (AA and APA) who continue to bear the burden of health disparities. This study is guided by NIMHD’s conceptual framework to address multiple influences of health disparities on HTN comorbidity among HIV-positive MSM disparity populations. Our knowledge of the of systemic/individual determinants on “… the effect of HIV related co-morbidities on the complexity of HIV/AIDS diseases progression” is not fully understood. Given these scientific gaps, we propose to use a longitudinal design to systematically examine a systemic/individual approach -- modeling after the NIMHD’s “Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework” -- to examine and elucidate the multiple determinants including behavioral, clinical, macro-social, and psychosocial factors -- herein known as “systemic/individual determinants) of hypertension observed among a cohort of racial/ethnic (African American; Asian Pacific American) men who have sex with men living with HIV/AIDS in two metropolitan cities (Philadelphia and

"Enhancing Partner Services among Men Who Have Sex with Men Living With HIV: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Project title: Enhancing Partner Services among Men Who Have Sex with Men Living With HIV: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Despite global efforts to control HIV among key populations, new infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) are still increasing. To deal with this challenge, HIV prevention strategies with high efficacy are urgently needed. Partner services (PS), the process of informing potential risk of exposure to sexual partners, is a cornerstone of HIV prevention. PS are important for identifying cases, reducing re-infection rates, promoting linkage to care, and reducing costs. However, barriers from both health providers and index cases limit the efficacy of PS. As a result, PS is underused in many countries, including China where only 16% of index HIV case spouses were notified. Crowdsourcing can be used to improve the effectiveness of PS. Crowdsourcing is an approach that obtains solutions from communities. Crowdsourcing has been used effectively in public health to improve HIV testing, promote condom use, and monitor outbreaks. As a bottom-up approach, crowdsourcing can effectively engage MSM and other stakeholders to contribute their voices to enhance understanding of HIV PS and design participant-oriented interventions. Crowdsourced messages developed for PS may resonate more strongly with MSM compared to traditional PS messages. In turn, this could lead to increased community participation and acceptance of HIV PS, improving the effectiveness of HIV PS. We hypothesize that a crowdsourced HIV PS approach is feasible and acceptable. We also hypothesize that, as compared to conventional PS using referral cards (standard of care in China), will yield: a) more sexual partners reporting for HIV testing, and b) more sexual partners with confirmed HIV. Our multi-disciplinary research team brings together crowdsourcing and PS experience, a history of working with MSM in China, and a rich local infrastructure for HIV research, to investigate the following aims: (1) to develop a crowdsourced PS intervention for Chinese MSM using open contests; (2) to test the feasibility, acceptability and pilot the preliminary impact of crowdsourced PS with conventional PS on promoting HIV testing uptake among partners of newly identified MSM cases using a pilot randomized controlled trial. In this pilot project, we will first use open contests to develop a crowdsourced PS intervention for Chinese MSM, then we will conduct a pilot RCT in which index MSM cases are randomized to receive crowdsourced intervention or standard of care in a ratio of 2:1. The project will develop crowdsourced intervention strategies for promoting HIV PS, and collect preliminary data for a full RCT that aims to further evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of crowdsourced PS in multiple Chinese cities. 澳 Public Health Relevance Statement: Project Narrative: Despite the investment of considerable resources in improving HIV partner services, there remains a large gap in the effectiveness of current HIV PS among men who have sex with men in low and middle-income countries. This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of crowdsourced PS, and observe whether the crowdsourced PS can result in greater HIV testing uptake among partners of index MSM HIV cases.",Enhancing Partner Services among Men Who Have Sex with Men Living With HIV: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,9780836,R34MH119963,"['Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Cities ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Computers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Entrepreneurial Skill ', ' Entrepreneurship ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Specialist ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' uptake ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Notification ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' service intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' hackathon ', ' hackfest ', ' hack day ', ' study population ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R34,2019,196159,0.08208703072220515
"Towards prevention of HIV among vulnerable and stigmatized populations using geospatial data HIV remains a global public health priority and occurs disproportionality among minority and stigmatized populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM). The occurrence of HIV is not random in the population, rather it exhibits patterns by individual and contextual factors. Is it the contextual factors, such as the neighborhood where one lives, socializes, or engages in sex, that is the focus of the proposed research. This proposed program of training and research examines the geospatial features of HIV using epidemiological data and analyses. The overarching goal is to improve the epidemiology of studying HIV by incorporating geospatial measures into HIV risk models through three areas. First, opportunities exist to tailor and refine existing HIV surveillance programs towards the most vulnerable groups using contextual determinants of risk. A second opportunity is to improve the validity of geospatial analyses through more accurate measurement and correct quantification of the spatial unit. A final opportunity is to improve risk quantification and reduce biased inference by applying spatial features of disease distribution to studying HIV risk. Taken together, attention to these three insights can improve HIV surveillance and epidemiology to guide prevention services. This project utilizes Philadelphia Department of Public Health’s AIDS Activities Coordinating Office surveillance data of people living with HIV/AIDS in Philadelphia in conjunction with data obtained via systematic review. Research questions to be answered include the optimal placement of HIV screening services in Philadelphia, the most appropriate choice of contextual unit to analyze spatial data (e.g., neighborhood, ZIP code, census tract), and the impact of sexual networks based upon geographic location of partner selection. Analyses will include advanced geospatial methods, hierarchical regression modeling, and agent-based simulation models. Follow-up work will include joint systems dynamic and agent-based models with a focus on health disparities in HIV. The proposed research will be complemented by experiential and didactic training in (1) geographic information systems and spatial analysis of epidemiologic data, (2) systems science and health disparities, and (3) epidemiological surveillance systems with a focus on HIV surveillance. This research and training will enable a program of independent research on the contextual factors relating neighborhood and HIV transmission and infection among vulnerable and stigmatized populations. HIV risk estimation models can be improved by utilizing geospatial data to fully capture the heterogeneous distribution of cases and risk factors, particularly among groups who may be stigmatized. This project will use Philadelphia specific surveillance data to model community- and individual-level factors relating to HIV transmission and infection among vulnerable populations. The overarching goal is to improve the quality of HIV epidemiologic research by incorporating geospatial data in surveillance to minimize bias and to guide HIV prevention services.",Towards prevention of HIV among vulnerable and stigmatized populations using geospatial data,9844550,K01AI143356,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology Surveillance ', ' Epidemiological surveillance ', ' Epidemiological Monitoring ', ' Epidemiologic surveillance ', ' Epidemiologic Monitoring ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Socialization ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Training Programs ', ' virusemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' viraemia ', ' Viremia ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' heuristics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' Minority ', ' Guide prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Network-based ', ' public health priorities ', ' surveillance data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' screening ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIAID,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,124366,0.0004945419219242666
"Multilevel Influences on HIV and Substance use in a YMSM Cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) ages 16-29 are disproportionately affected by HIV, with high prevalence and incidence. While all other risk groups have declining rates of infection, dramatic increases are occurring among YMSM. YMSM are understudied, but preliminary research demonstrates that the HIV epidemic in YMSM forms a syndemic with drug use, violence, and mental health problems. The proposed study will build a dynamic dyadic-network cohort of 1,358 YMSM by hybridizing 2 existing cohorts of YMSM: Project Q2 (aged 20-24) and ChiGuys (aged 16-17). We will expand this unified cohort through the enrollment of serious sexual partners of core participants, thereby creating a dynamic dyadic network. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply a ""next generation"" multilevel model (Network-Individual-Resources model) to understand the syndemic among a cohort of YMSM and inform ""high-impact"" HIV prevention with this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, we propose four specific aims. Aim 1 is to understand how syndemics of substance use, HIV, STIs, mental disorders, and violence develop among YMSM using an accelerated longitudinal design. We will assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood, to describe the trajectories of syndemic development (including substance use) and use innovative statistical modeling to characterize different trajectories of syndemic development to predict youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. Aim 2 is to determine how dyadic processes influence HIV risk behaviors and transmission among YMSM by enrolling their serious sexual partners into the cohort. We will utilize dyadic data to identify which sexual partner and relationship factors are longitudinally related to unprotected sex and HIV/STI transmission across development. Phylogenetic analyses will link HIV transmissions within dyads to determine what behavioral, partner and dyadic factors predict such transmission. Aim 3 is to describe network and structural influences on syndemic development among YMSM.

"HIV intervention models for criminal justice involved substance-using Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such ""shocks"" lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations.

"Mentoring in patient-oriented research on HIV and global health PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this K24 mid-career investigator award is to support Dr. Bassett’s mentoring activities and patient-oriented research to improve engagement in HIV care and related conditions globally. Dr. Bassett is a practicing Infectious Disease physician with over 14 years of experience leading clinical research in South Africa related to HIV and TB screening and treatment, for which she received the HIV Medicine Association Research Award in 2015. She has served as a mentor to 15 young investigators, four of whom are currently supported by K awards. Dr. Bassett is deeply committed to continuing and further expanding her mentorship to include trainees from outside of Infectious Disease and those based in sub-Saharan Africa. She has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of advisors who can support her and her trainees’ career development. Dr. Bassett is the Director of the Harvard Center for AIDS Research Developmental Core and its Mentoring Programs, and directs a mock K grant review session three times yearly as well as a grant-writing workshop for the Harvard community. She won the Harvard Medical School Young Mentor Award in 2013 in recognition of her mentoring activities. She proposes an inter-related set of training, mentoring and research objectives that expand the scope of her research into new areas (e.g. HIV prevention, community-based treatment for HIV- associated non-communicable diseases). This K24 would provide Dr. Bassett with: 1) protected time for mentoring early career investigators dedicated to patient-oriented HIV research, including those based in sub- Saharan Africa, 2) a platform for mid-career professional development in mixed methods, implementation science approaches, and expanded mentorship and international partnerships, and 3) an opportunity for new data collection to inform her mentees’ and her own future research programs. Dr. Bassett will leverage her collaborations and partnerships in Umlazi Township, Durban, South Africa, a community with a high HIV burden and one of the highest HIV incidences among young women in the world. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop innovative, community-based research that addresses fundamental questions about how to improve uptake of HIV prevention and long-term ART provision, as well as how to integrate other critical health needs such as diabetes management and contraception into HIV programs. The proposed high- impact research has direct and immediate application in a high-risk South African township and will support the protected time and resources required for Dr. Bassett to mentor young investigators from both the US and sub- Saharan Africa in patient-oriented research. PROJECT NARRATIVE While sub-Saharan African countries have made great strides in creating successful national HIV care programs, rigorous research is needed to evaluate how best to incorporate HIV prevention, HIV treatment, and HIV-related non-communicable disease care into community-based settings. Dr. Bassett has a long and successful track record mentoring trainees and is deeply committed to expanding this mentoring. She will harness her long-standing collaborations in a community with a high HIV burden to evaluate strategies for improving access to HIV prevention and long-term treatment and to mentor the next generation of patient- oriented researchers.",Mentoring in patient-oriented research on HIV and global health,9790038,K24AI141036,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adoption ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies Promising new tools for HIV prevention and treatment have stimulated global initiatives to “End the HIV Epidemic” and reach the “End of AIDS;” however, significant challenges to ending the global HIV epidemic remain. Biomedical advances for prevention and treatment will not reach their full potential without rigorous behavioral and social science research to optimize uptake, adherence, and equitable and effective implementation and scale-up. Thus, we propose a renewed HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies that expands on our history of conducting interdisciplinary HIV research and leverages new partnerships to maximize the potential of biomedical advances, addressing their availability and acceptability to the most vulnerable populations. The HIV Center is unique among NIMH AIDS Research Centers (ARCs) in being based in New York City (NYC), a continuing US AIDS epicenter in a state that has the greatest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, including ethnic/racial minority populations coping with extreme economic, health, and social disparities. In 2014, HIV Center investigators and other academicians, providers, advocates, and policy-makers joined the Office of the Governor of New York State (NYS) to develop a NYS Blueprint for Ending the Epidemic (EtE). The Blueprint provides the HIV Center with the unique opportunity to use our home city and state as a “laboratory” to study implementation of EtE initiatives and apply lessons learned to US and global epidemics. Thus, in the next five years, the HIV Center will be guided by the theme, The Science of Ending the HIV/AIDS Epidemic (EtE): Efficacy to Effectiveness at Scale, and its emphasis on implementation research and research at the intersection of behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences.  The HIV Center brings together a cadre of investigators at the forefront of multiple disciplines to address three Specific Aims: (1) to catalyze intervention and implementation science research necessary to achieve EtE goals; (2) to translate research into culturally and structurally competent practice and policy for maximum public health impact; and (3) to increase the capacity of current and future generations of scientists, service providers, and community and policy leaders to create and implement biomedical, behavioral, social, and structural HIV prevention and treatment interventions to meet EtE goals. Our Cores ensure methodological and theoretical rigor, identify and rapidly respond to new trends in the epidemic, support critical research- practice partnerships, and train new scientists. We complement the Administrative and Development Cores with three Research Cores: (1) Statistics, Assessment, and Data Management (StAD) Core, focused on innovative analytic, assessment, and data management strategies; (2) Bio-Behavioral Core, focused on research at the interface of the biomedical and the behavioral and social sciences; and (3) Implementation Science and Health Outcomes (ISHO) Core focused on effective, sustained, and equitable achievement of HIV prevention and care outcomes at scale. The HIV Center will continue as a global leader in HIV prevention and the fight to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV-related health and social disparities that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable – women, youth, racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations, and other disenfranchised groups. We will work to meet “Ending the HIV Epidemic” goals by synergizing institutional and intellectual resources; invigorating our multidisciplinary community of scientists, clinicians, and policy-makers; rigorously training a new generation of scientists; supporting research partnerships with public health policy and practice sectors; and translating transformative NIH-supported HIV/AIDS research into real-world practice and policy. We will apply the lessons learned from our research to improve the health and well being of all affected by the HIV epidemic, regardless of where they reside.",HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies,9987067,P30MH043520,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Personnel Management ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' Generations ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' fighting ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' health economics ', ' implementation research ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' social disparities ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based service ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' health practice ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' social science research ', ' sexual minority ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' service providers ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P30,2019,174932,0.04694597226673286
"Sexual Networks and HIV Transmission Clusters among Substance Using MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Heather A. Pines with the training and experience needed to facilitate her transition toward research independence in HIV prevention science. Dr. Pines' career development plan is designed to augment her training in epidemiology and allow her to: 1) develop expertise in social network analysis, 2) acquire skills in the use of genetic sequence analysis methods to identify HIV transmission clusters (i.e., individuals with genetically related HIV infections), 3) obtain further training in the ethical conduct of research, and 4) build the sklls necessary for a successful academic career. These training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, hands-on research, and mentoring from an interdisciplinary team of experts. Global disparities in resource allocation to HIV prevention services may limit the promise of recent breakthroughs in HIV prevention science, particularly among vulnerable substance using populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Innovative research that integrates social network and genetic sequence analysis methods to direct the delivery of biomedical HIV prevention strategies to individuals at greatest risk may help maximize their impact, control costs, and facilitate their implementation in the context of limited prevention resources. To this end, the overall objective of Dr. Pines' research project is to inform the development of comprehensive HIV prevention programs that leverage information on sexual network characteristics to interrupt HIV transmission among MSM in LMIC. The project will be embedded in a NIDA study among MSM in Tijuana, Mexico (R01DA037811; PI: Patterson), to capitalize on its research infrastructure and the expertise of its bi-national collaborators, and provide Dr. Pines with the opportunity to apply her newly acquired skills in social network and genetic sequence analysis. Pilot data suggest elevated rates of substance use and associated sexual risk behaviors may be driving the HIV epidemic among MSM in Tijuana. Thus, understanding the impact of substance use on sexual network characteristics and HIV transmission dynamics among MSM will be a major focus of this research. Specifically, the project aims to: 1) examine the influence of mean degree (number of male anal intercourse partners), the degree distribution, and sexual mixing patterns on overall sexual network structure among MSM; 2) identify individual, sexual network compositional, and socio-contextual factors associated with degree; and 3) determine whether sexual mixing patterns are associated with HIV transmission cluster membership. Findings from this project will be critical to Dr. Pines' development of an R01 proposal that integrates epidemiologic, social network, and genetic sequence analysis methods to advance HIV prevention science. These training and research activities will position Dr. Pines as the only researcher in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego with this unique skill set and enable her to develop an independent research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in HIV prevention science could significantly reduce HIV incidence worldwide.1 However, their promise may be limited among men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where HIV prevention resources for MSM populations are limited.2 The proposed training and research activities will enable the candidate to apply interdisciplinary research methods to investigate MSM sexual networks in Tijuana, Mexico in order to direct the delivery of scarce prevention resources and support the development of cost-effective, sexual network-based HIV prevention strategies for MSM in LMIC.",Sexual Networks and HIV Transmission Clusters among Substance Using MSM,9725952,K01DA040543,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ',

"Efficacy of Couples-Based HIV Prevention in Vulnerable Young Men Project Summary Adolescent and young adult men who have sex with men (YMSM) are the only group in the U.S. in which rates of new HIV infections are increasing, which reflects a large disparity relative to heterosexuals. Steady or main partner relationships account for a substantial proportion of new HIV infections in YMSM. Among YMSM a serious relationship status is perhaps the strongest predictor of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), and pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be discontinued in a relationship. Romantic relationships also provide myriad benefits, including promotion of mental, behavioral, and physical health. Despite the critical importance of romantic relationship factors for HIV prevention, the vast majority of studies and interventions focus on individuals. We conducted formative research on coupled YMSM through an NIH R21 from which we developed an innovative couples-based intervention that addresses the continuum of HIV prevention and care for YMSM couples. The 2GETHER program integrates couples- and group-based modalities and is innovative in its design to address HIV transmission risk in couples regardless of serostatus; couples learn to utilize behavioral and biomedical approaches to prevent both HIV acquisition and transmission, with an overarching emphasis on improving relationship functioning. 2GETHER further encourages uptake of couples-based HIV testing for HIV-/unknown YMSM and medication adherence and engagement in care for HIV+ YMSM. We established feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of 2GETHER in a pilot trial of coupled YMSM (N=60 couples; 120 individuals), including significant decreases in HIV transmission risk behavior. Based on our highly successful pilot, we propose to test the efficacy of 2GETHER in large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will: (a) enroll racially diverse coupled YMSM; (b) randomize couples to either the 2GETHER intervention or attention-matched positive affect skills program for couples; (c) measure intervention outcomes through 12 months post-intervention. Analysis of study outcomes will utilize both individual- and dyadic-level data. Primary HIV risk behavioral outcome: an individual-level dichotomous variable indicating presence of CAI with a serodiscordant or unknown status partner. Exploratory analysis will calculate an innovative variable that accounts for the relative risk of sexual behaviors with partners of different serostatus, accounting for biomedical prevention. Primary biomedical outcome: Chlamydia/Gonnorhea incidence in individuals. Secondary dyadic-level HIV risk outcomes: concordance/discordance in relationship sexual agreement type and presence of agreement breaks. Secondary individual-level engagement in care outcomes: HIV testing uptake (HIV- men) and medication adherence (HIV+ men). In the context of increasing fatigue for HIV prevention, a healthy relationships program for coupled YMSM presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Further, in the era of treatment as prevention, we must develop transmission prevention strategies for MSM regardless of serostatus that address the full continuum of prevention and care. Project Narrative Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM), but YMSM report increasing fatigue with HIV prevention messages and strategies. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among YMSM by establishing the efficacy of an innovative, healthy relationship program for coupled YMSM (regardless of HIV status) that aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies, as well as primary and secondary prevention approaches.",Efficacy of Couples-Based

"Network Dynamics of Syphillis Coinfection within Biomedical Prevention ABSTRACT In the United States (US), the highest percentage increase in primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis rates occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM). Among MSM, the rates of P&S syphilis have increased disproportionately among young Black MSM (YBMSM). The syphilis epidemic among MSM also has been marked by a high rate of HIV co-infection for biological/virologic, behavioral, and epidemiological reasons. Syphilis and HIV epidemics overlap, in part, because syphilis facilitates HIV infection by disrupting normally protective mucosal and epithelial barriers, and this in turn causes co-infected sex partners to be at greater risk of transmitting HIV to uninfected individuals. From an epidemiological network perspective, infections with both syphilis and HIV occur most frequently in network contexts in which HIV-uninfected MSM belong to sexual networks with a high prevalence of HIV and syphilis. Such sexual networks may be formed through social spaces or venues frequented by syphilis-infected MSM, where HIV is often co-prevalent. Thus, the social venues of YBMSM may provide clues to sexual network formation and downstream syphilis infections. We conceptualize syphilis-dynamics among YBMSM as social processes that are co-evolved with HIV dynamics, sexual behavioral dynamics and network contextual dynamics (social space, sex/social/peer relationships). In addition, we conceptualize that these social processes are affected by the behavioral dynamics of ARV-based prevention factors (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP], treatment as prevention [TasP], and seroadaptive/sorting behaviors. This application employs state-of-the-art longitudinal network and behavioral dynamics modeling methodologies to address the epidemiological problem of co- evolving syphilis and HIV epidemics. These methodologies have the capability to model the complex dynamic processes at multiple levels simultaneously, taking into account syphilis-HIV transmission dynamics, sex- behavioral dynamics, network dynamics, and risk-reduction behavioral dynamics among YBMSM. We propose to use existing empirical longitudinal data of YBMSM aged 16 to 29 in two large urban cities, Houston and Chicago to develop potential points of entry for intervention strategies to limit syphilis transmission (i.e., post- exposure prophylaxis, network-level syphilis treatment). Our specific aims are to: (1) model syphilis infection dynamics, co-evolved with HIV infection, sex behavior, network contexts of social space and sexual/social relationships; (2) examine how these social processes affect and are affected risk reduction behaviors and by HIV biomedical prevention. This study has the potential to deepen our understanding of the drivers of syphilis infection in the context of networks, behavior, and risk reduction. The results will lead directly to interventions that identify key levers of syphilis transmission as well as additional research that models how emerging syphilis prevention approaches such as syphilis post-exposure prophylaxis may be integrated into HIV prevention options in the U.S. RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of the proposed network study is to investigate complex syphilis-HIV transmission dynamic processes, coevolved with sex behavioral dynamic, and sexual network dynamic, and risk reduction behavioral dynamic among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed study is relevant to public health, as it addresses fundamental questions about human health behavior, from biological, behavioral, and epidemiological perspectives, to alleviate racial/ethnic health disparities in disease rates in regard to YBMSM. This study will provide new directions for developing effective interventions to better understand the growing epidemic of HIV and syphilis co-infection and to create effective syphilis eliminations interventions for most-at-risk population in the United States.",Network Dynamics of Syphillis Coinfection within Biomedical Prevention,9706745,R21AI139480,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methodology ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Persons ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' United States ', ' virology ', ' Work ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Epithelial ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' life-style risk reduction ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' Collaborations ', ' Oral Sex ', ' Complex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' age group ', ' social space ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' Graph ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' effective intervention ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' Social Processes ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2019,226295,0.0440547632685576
"HIV Risk and Psychosocial Health Among Transgender Women in Peru Project Summary Globally, transgender women (TW) are devastatingly burdened by HIV infection with an estimated 19.1% prevalence (meta-analysis), a nearly 50-fold increased odds of HIV relative to the general population worldwide. In Peru, TW are the most affected population, with 29.8%-48.8% HIV prevalence in the capital city of Lima, and steep increases in HIV infection rates in those ages 25 years and older. Therefore, young transgender women (YTW) ages 16-24 years constitute a critically important, yet understudied, group for early primary HIV prevention efforts. Very little is known about the mental health and psychosocial vulnerabilities (e.g., depression, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], substance use disorder, gender-based violence) experienced by YTW in Peru. Concomitant mental health and other psychosocial health conditions resulting from stigma, and during the critical developmental period of late adolescence and young adulthood, may synergistically potentiate risk for HIV for YTW in Peru, and influence biobehavioral HIV prevention targets like protected sex, sterile needle injecting practices, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake. Guided by a psychosocial syndemics framework and Lifecourse Health Development model, the goal of this study is to: a) characterize the prevalence, distribution, and correlates of HIV infection and related STI co-infections in YTW ages 16-24 years in Lima, Peru, and b) assess co-occurring mental health and psychosocial conditions (vulnerabilities and resiliencies) and their influence on HIV transmission risk. In Aim 1, we will conduct formative in-depth interviews to understand developmental and psychosocial contexts of HIV risk for YTW in Peru. We will also gather data on perceived acceptability and barriers/ facilitators to social network-based recruitment methods. In Aim 2, we will characterize the prevalence, distribution, and correlates of HIV and STI- coinfections, and multiple stigma-related health conditions (e.g., depression, PTSD, substance use disorder, bullying, family rejection) in a sample of 400 YTW recruited via social network-based methods. We will characterize the acceptability and rates of recruitment to inform future HIV prevention trials. In Aim 3, we will test several statistical approaches to modeling co-occurring syndemic risk factors in YTW, and simultaneously consider: the extent to which conditions in the aggregate are associated with HIV risk; the extent to which conditions interact to intensify HIV risk. Reducing HIV disparities for transgender populations in Peru will require reaching YTW ages 16-24 years for early HIV prevention. This study will increase scientific knowledge of the multiple mental health and psychosocial intersecting epidemics fueling HIV risk and STI co-morbidities in YTW. Findings will inform the design and implementation of biobehavioral HIV prevention interventions for YTW in Peru, such as those which target developmentally-specific clusters of stigma-related conditions, to maximize impact on the HIV epidemic and decrease HIV burden among TW globally. Findings can also be used to inform early HIV prevention efforts for Latina/ Hispanic YTW in the U.S. Project Narrative Young transgender women (YTW) ages 16-24 years are a critically important, yet understudied, group for early biobehavioral HIV prevention efforts globally, given the devastating burden of HIV infection among transgender women and the steep increase in HIV infection rates among transgender women ages 25 years and older. The proposed study will: a) characterize the prevalence, distribution, and correlates of HIV infection and related STI co-infections in YTW ages 16-24 years in Lima the capital city of Peru, and b) assess developmentally-situated co-occurring mental health and psychosocial factors (vulnerabilities and resiliencies) and their influence on HIV risk to inform future HIV prevention interventions for YTW. Reducing HIV disparities in Peruvian transgender women will require early HIV prevention interventions, such as those targeting the multiple stigma-related conditions that YTW experience in development which may fuel HIV risk and inhibit uptake of biomedical HIV prevention efforts.",HIV Risk and Psychosocial Health Among Transgender Women in Peru,9695623,R21MH118110,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Capital ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' critical developmental period ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Health ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Needles ', ' Peru ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Puberty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Socialization ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' Biological ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Fostering ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' Safe Sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Sterility ', ' sterile ', ' peer ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' model development ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' maltreatment ', ' mistreatment ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Network-based ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' critical period ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' transphobia ', ' transphobic ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' gender-based violence ', ' Peruvian ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' HCV ', ' recruit ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,198636,0.048063123789106404
"A pragmatic trial of two strategies for implementing an effective eHealth HIV prevention program Despite evidence that eHealth approaches can be effective in reducing HIV risk, their implementation requirements do not fit within established strategies for public health scale up—leaving it an open question as to how to bring these programs into practice. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address this need by developing and evaluating novel strategies for implementing eHealth HIV prevention programs. Keep It Up! (KIU!) is an online program proven to reduce HIV risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), including YMSM at elevated HIV risk due to behaviors (i.e., condomless sex, substance use) and demographics (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities). Strong evidence of effectiveness on behavioral and biomedical outcomes makes KIU! an ideal eHealth intervention for implementation science. Lessons learned will set the pathway for implementation of the many HIV eHealth programs currently undergoing efficacy testing.  Through formative research with community-based organizations (CBOs), health departments, the CDC, and researchers we have identified two pragmatic implementation strategies that we will evaluate and compare: Strategy 1: CBOs apply for, and are selected for, funding to deliver KIU! through their current HIV testing programs. Strategy 2 is a “direct-to-consumer” (DTC) model where centralized staff recruit participants nationally through online advertising campaigns and manage engagement. HIV/STI testing kits are shipped directly to YMSM and, upon documentation of an HIV negative test result, participants are delivered KIU!  Aim 1: Compare two implementation strategies using a cluster randomized trial. 75 counties with large YMSM populations will be randomized 2:1 to strategy 1 (CBO) or strategy 2 (DTC). KIU! will be delivered in each county for two years. In this cluster randomized trial, the unit of randomization is the county, with implementation and effectiveness outcome data collected from YMSM participants, CBOs, and the technology vendor. Our primary outcomes are public health impact (defined as reach X effectiveness) and cost per infection averted. We will also collect and report as secondary outcomes multiple metrics of reach, effectiveness, and implementation.  Aim 2: Examine adoption characteristics that explain variability in implementation outcomes. We will conduct mixed-methods research on the domains from the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to explain variability in implementation success. Data on CFIR characteristics will be collected through administrative data, and surveys and telephone interviews with key stakeholders.  We will also explore maintenance/sustainment of KIU! at the completion of the study. CBOs will be provided with materials to facilitate applying for external funding to continue to provide KIU! after study completion, including an Impact Tool to estimate local impact and costs. Through expert consultation we will examine models for ongoing sustainment of the DTC model.

The proposed study will lead the way in understanding implementation of eHealth interventions by testing two pragmatic strategies for delivering the Keep It Up! 3.0 program.

"Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the happy consequences of HAART is that HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals now have available to them medications that allow them to reach old age. This means that we have the previously unexpected challenge of finding ways to support healthy aging in communities with high HIV prevalence rates. This challenge is likely to be particularly difficult among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to not only their very high background HIV prevalence rates but also the general dearth of proven models to promote healthy aging among older MSM. To meet this challenge, we need to develop health promotion programs that are more potent than the efficacious but time-limited effects found among HIV prevention interventions. Thus, we need to identify mechanisms to raise levels of intervention efficacy to support healthy aging beyond those that have already been tapped to support other health promotion efforts among MSM. In previous research by our group, we documented that specific resiliencies among MSM appear to have robust health-promoting properties. Resiliencies research conducted among aging MSM is an innovative agenda on several counts. The dominant approach to explaining patterns of health among MSM has been to study the effects of deficits in creating health disparities. While an emphasis on deficits is useful in explaining the life course trajectories of men who have multiple psychosocial health problems that result in poor health outcomes, this focus is less helpful in explaining the trajectories of te far larger proportion of MSM who have also experienced cultural marginalization and yet remain healthy well into later life. This application proposes the following aims to test a theory-based approach to identifying both deficits and resiliencies among aging MSM over six waves of data collection (N=1850) using an ongoing cohort study.1)To measure changes in prevalence rates of psychosocial health problems and resiliencies over time; 2)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with changes in substance use and other psychosocial health problems and to test whether resiliencies moderate the pathway to syndemics; and 3)To test if changing rates of resiliencies over time are associated with better HIV-related outcomes and biomarkers among HIV-positive MSM and to test if resiliencies moderate the impact of syndemics on these same outcomes. By identifying the resiliencies already used by some aging MSM to stay healthy but which have yet to be incorporated in current health promotion efforts for MSM, we can progress to the testing of potentially efficacious health promotion programs to support healthy aging among MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although many older men who have sex with men (MSM) exhibit significant strengths that have helped them remain healthy well into later life, these strategies have not been well documented. In particular, the strengths, or resiliencies, of older MSM have not been carefully studied in terms of their ability to support health as men age. This study will use a theory-based approach to follow aging MSM in six waves of an ongoing cohort study to document how resiliencies moderate the effects of health risks to better explain patterns of health and illness among aging MSM.",Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging among Men Who Have Sex with Men,9716407,R01MD010680,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' resilience ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older men ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' rate of change ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' The Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,471767,0.08162792676186323
"Adapting and Pilot Testing a Behavioral Intervention to Incorporate Advances in HIV Prevention for Black Young MSM in Alabama PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this 5-year Mentored Research Scientist Development K01-Award is to support Henna Budhwani, PhD, MPH become an independent investigator in the field of HIV prevention. The proposed project seeks to address the HIV crisis in Alabama, where rates of undiagnosed HIV in black young men who have sex with men (YMSM, 18-29 years) exceed 20%. This project will adapt and test a behavioral intervention to promote HIV rapid testing in the community, deliver culturally appropriate prevention education, offer sociostructural supports, and refer eligible participants for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Four training objectives are proposed that are in lockstep with three specific aims. Objective 1 includes an intensive training and mentoring plan in social theory including theories of intersectionality and emerging masculinities. Objective 2 includes in- depth training on qualitative research methods including how to conduct focus groups, in-depth interviews, and qualitative data analysis. Aim 1, which will be conducted after Objective 2, is to elucidate experiences, beliefs, and predictors related to delivery and utilization of HIV testing and prevention services by black YMSM using qualitative research methods, namely in-depth interviews with HIV outreach staff, focus groups with black YMSM, and in-depth interviews with members of key sub-groups (e.g. transgender women) to inform the adaptation of the Brothers Saving Brothers (BSB) intervention. Objective 3 includes didactic and hands-on training on how to scientifically adapt HIV behavioral interventions using validated frameworks, such as intervention mapping. Aim 2 is to adapt the BSB intervention to include two HIV prevention tools (rapid testing and PrEP), to address structural barriers, and to be acceptable to black YMSM in Alabama. Objective 4 includes comprehensive training and mentoring in the field of implementation science. Aim 3, which concludes the proposed research study and K01 project, is to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation pilot study of the adapted intervention in which the candidate will a) assess acceptability and feasibility of adapted BSB (aBSB); b) preliminarily estimate effects on HIV prevention outcomes; and c) collect data on real-world implementation. These aims will be accomplished by collaborating with two community-based organizations that are well-respected for their HIV prevention work in study communities. This rigorous project includes intensive training at the candidate's home university, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and from other prominent institutions that offer very specific training not found at UAB; engagement within the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN); comprehensive mentoring from senior HIV researchers with expertise in minority, youth, and MSM health; and a thoughtful research strategy that addresses significant threats, high rates of undiagnosed HIV and insufficient engagement with HIV prevention services, including PrEP, in black YMSM in Alabama. The combination of the proposed mentoring and training with study findings will culminate in the candidate's attainment of independence and development of a full-scale, implementation science R01 proposal to test aBSB. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research has the potential to make important contributions toward addressing some of the most significant and current public health challenges in the United States, namely high rates of HIV infection and HIV-related morbidity and mortality among black young men who have sex with men (YMSM, age 18-29). This study will do so by adapting a behavioral intervention, Brothers Saving Brothers (BSB), to include two HIV prevention tools (community-based rapid testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP), include sociostructural supports, and for delivery in a new environment (Alabama in the United States Deep South), then testing the adapted intervention employing an implementation science hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial design. Results of this study, jointly with the formal training and mentoring the candidate will receive through this K01-Award, will prepare her to develop a robust R01 proposal to conduct a regional, full-scale implementation science randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention across southern states and attain professional independence.",Adapting and Pilot Testing a Behavioral Intervention to Incorporate Advances in HIV Prevention for Black Young MSM in Alabama,9694373,K01MH116737,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alabama ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Savings ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Brothers ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Update ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Prevention education ', ' implementation trial ', ' pilot trial ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' Adolescent Medicine Trials Network ', ' Adolescent Trials Network ', ' eligible participant ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention effect ', ' same sex behavior ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' trial design ', ' racial minority ', ' intersectionality ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' testing services ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K01,2019,179346,-0.04601785223031896
"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS Abstract/Summary Since the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, it has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings, contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years, CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, and the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment as well as the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized Implementation Science (IS) and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs, with emphasis on training for underrepresented minorities to diversify the field of HIV research. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will continue to develop and support the New England HIV Implementation Science Network, a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers that we established in 2014 to focus on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence, RI and New Haven, CT. Network activities will augment other efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to small cities/towns and other understudied communities. While focusing on the New England region, we will seek to become a national resource for IS research on the HIV epidemic, generating studies with findings of potential applicability to other highly impacted areas such as the southern parts of the U.S. We will focus on drivers of the epidemic and use the expertise of CIRA scientists to address the intertwined issues of substance use, mental health and stigma, and the impact of the current opioid epidemic on HIV risk and incidence. Our global research will also focus on advancing IS and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, thus supporting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals and priorities in the 2017 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV Research. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical and Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods. Each core will support and build capacity for IS research. We will embed Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) approaches into strategic planning and evaluation processes to optimize Center efficiency and services. Core specific and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project Narrative Recent advances in HIV science make ending the epidemic achievable, yet barriers to implementing proven strategies in practice persist. HIV disparities, rising incidence of HIV in young MSM, increasingly complex HIV co-morbidities, the opioid epidemic, the aging of the HIV population, and the need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public health.

"HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies Promising new tools for HIV prevention and treatment have stimulated global initiatives to “End the HIV Epidemic” and reach the “End of AIDS;” however, significant challenges to ending the global HIV epidemic remain. Biomedical advances for prevention and treatment will not reach their full potential without rigorous behavioral and social science research to optimize uptake, adherence, and equitable and effective implementation and scale-up. Thus, we propose a renewed HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies that expands on our history of conducting interdisciplinary HIV research and leverages new partnerships to maximize the potential of biomedical advances, addressing their availability and acceptability to the most vulnerable populations. The HIV Center is unique among NIMH AIDS Research Centers (ARCs) in being based in New York City (NYC), a continuing US AIDS epicenter in a state that has the greatest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, including ethnic/racial minority populations coping with extreme economic, health, and social disparities. In 2014, HIV Center investigators and other academicians, providers, advocates, and policy-makers joined the Office of the Governor of New York State (NYS) to develop a NYS Blueprint for Ending the Epidemic (EtE). The Blueprint provides the HIV Center with the unique opportunity to use our home city and state as a “laboratory” to study implementation of EtE initiatives and apply lessons learned to US and global epidemics. Thus, in the next five years, the HIV Center will be guided by the theme, The Science of Ending the HIV/AIDS Epidemic (EtE): Efficacy to Effectiveness at Scale, and its emphasis on implementation research and research at the intersection of behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences.  The HIV Center brings together a cadre of investigators at the forefront of multiple disciplines to address three Specific Aims: (1) to catalyze intervention and implementation science research necessary to achieve EtE goals; (2) to translate research into culturally and structurally competent practice and policy for maximum public health impact; and (3) to increase the capacity of current and future generations of scientists, service providers, and community and policy leaders to create and implement biomedical, behavioral, social, and structural HIV prevention and treatment interventions to meet EtE goals. Our Cores ensure methodological and theoretical rigor, identify and rapidly respond to new trends in the epidemic, support critical research- practice partnerships, and train new scientists. We complement the Administrative and Development Cores with three Research Cores: (1) Statistics, Assessment, and Data Management (StAD) Core, focused on innovative analytic, assessment, and data management strategies; (2) Bio-Behavioral Core, focused on research at the interface of the biomedical and the behavioral and social sciences; and (3) Implementation Science and Health Outcomes (ISHO) Core focused on effective, sustained, and equitable achievement of HIV prevention and care outcomes at scale. The HIV Center will continue as a global leader in HIV prevention and the fight to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV-related health and social disparities that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable – women, youth, racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations, and other disenfranchised groups. We will work to meet “Ending the HIV Epidemic” goals by synergizing institutional and intellectual resources; invigorating our multidisciplinary community of scientists, clinicians, and policy-makers; rigorously training a new generation of scientists; supporting research partnerships with public health policy and practice sectors; and translating transformative NIH-supported HIV/AIDS research into real-world practice and policy.

"Social media HIV prevention intervention for rural women drug users ABSTRACT The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based intervention for HIV prevention for a high-risk group of rural women in Appalachia. This study has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge on the use of social media to increase access to prevention interventions to reduce high-risk substance use and related health disparities among rural women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in Appalachia. Successfully accomplishing study aims will respond to a critical and unmet need to increase the reach and scope of prevention interventions using social media, as well as advance knowledge about the high-risk drug use behaviors of this underserved group. Considering the need for prevention interventions among this high-risk group and the popularity of Facebook, the purpose of this R34 proposal is to adapt an evidence-based HIV prevention intervention for social media delivery and to feasibility test through a randomized control trial with 60 high-risk rural women drug users. The following aims guide the proposed study: (1) Adapt the NIDA Standard for HIV prevention for delivery via Facebook; and (2) Examine the feasibility of the adapted intervention with high-risk rural women through a randomized control pilot. The proposed use of Facebook in this study is promising because it is a stable, widely used, cost-efficient platform that could be leveraged to increase access to critically needed HIV prevention education. This study presents an exciting opportunity to examine the use of Facebook as a technique to expand the reach of evidence- based preventions interventions for high-risk drug users who are not likely to engage in formal treatment. Findings from this study will inform development of the larger R01 which would allow examination of the effectiveness and sustainability of this HIV prevention intervention in understudied, high risk populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based HIV prevention education for high-risk, underserved rural women in Appalachia.

"Adapting and Pilot Testing a Behavioral Intervention to Incorporate Advances in HIV Prevention for Black Young MSM in Alabama PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this 5-year Mentored Research Scientist Development K01-Award is to support Henna Budhwani, PhD, MPH become an independent investigator in the field of HIV prevention. The proposed project seeks to address the HIV crisis in Alabama, where rates of undiagnosed HIV in black young men who have sex with men (YMSM, 18-29 years) exceed 20%. This project will adapt and test a behavioral intervention to promote HIV rapid testing in the community, deliver culturally appropriate prevention education, offer sociostructural supports, and refer eligible participants for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Four training objectives are proposed that are in lockstep with three specific aims. Objective 1 includes an intensive training and mentoring plan in social theory including theories of intersectionality and emerging masculinities. Objective 2 includes in- depth training on qualitative research methods including how to conduct focus groups, in-depth interviews, and qualitative data analysis. Aim 1, which will be conducted after Objective 2, is to elucidate experiences, beliefs, and predictors related to delivery and utilization of HIV testing and prevention services by black YMSM using qualitative research methods, namely in-depth interviews with HIV outreach staff, focus groups with black YMSM, and in-depth interviews with members of key sub-groups (e.g. transgender women) to inform the adaptation of the Brothers Saving Brothers (BSB) intervention. Objective 3 includes didactic and hands-on training on how to scientifically adapt HIV behavioral interventions using validated frameworks, such as intervention mapping. Aim 2 is to adapt the BSB intervention to include two HIV prevention tools (rapid testing and PrEP), to address structural barriers, and to be acceptable to black YMSM in Alabama. Objective 4 includes comprehensive training and mentoring in the field of implementation science. Aim 3, which concludes the proposed research study and K01 project, is to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation pilot study of the adapted intervention in which the candidate will a) assess acceptability and feasibility of adapted BSB (aBSB); b) preliminarily estimate effects on HIV prevention outcomes; and c) collect data on real-world implementation. These aims will be accomplished by collaborating with two community-based organizations that are well-respected for their HIV prevention work in study communities. This rigorous project includes intensive training at the candidate's home university, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and from other prominent institutions that offer very specific training not found at UAB; engagement within the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN); comprehensive mentoring from senior HIV researchers with expertise in minority, youth, and MSM health; and a thoughtful research strategy that addresses significant threats, high rates of undiagnosed HIV and insufficient engagement with HIV prevention services, including PrEP, in black YMSM in Alabama. The combination of the proposed mentoring and training with study findings will culminate in the candidate's attainment of independence and development of a full-scale, implementation science R01 proposal to test aBSB. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research has the potential to make important contributions toward addressing some of the most significant and current public health challenges in the United States, namely high rates of HIV infection and HIV-related morbidity and mortality among black young men who have sex with men (YMSM, age 18-29). This study will do so by adapting a behavioral intervention, Brothers Saving Brothers (BSB), to include two HIV prevention tools (community-based rapid testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP), include sociostructural supports, and for delivery in a new environment (Alabama in the United States Deep South), then testing the adapted intervention employing an implementation science hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial design. Results of this study, jointly with the formal training and mentoring the candidate will receive through this K01-Award, will prepare her to develop a robust R01 proposal to conduct a regional, full-scale implementation science randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention across southern states and attain professional independence.",Adapting and Pilot Testing a Behavioral Intervention to Incorporate Advances in HIV Prevention for Black Young MSM in Alabama,9927669,K01MH116737,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alabama ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Belief ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Savings ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Brothers ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Prevention education ', ' pilot trial ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' Adolescent Trials Network ', ' Adolescent Medicine Trials Network ', ' eligible participant ', ' implementation science ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' intervention effect ', ' same sex behavior ', ' trans-women ', ' transwoman ', ' transwomen ', ' transgender women ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' trial design ', ' racial minority ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' testing services ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' effectiveness implementation trial ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K01,2020,179355,-0.04601785223031896
"San Francisco-Rio de Janeiro collaborative research on HIV prevalence, risk, and biomedical prevention interventions among young men who have sex with men ABSTRACT As San Francisco’s HIV epidemic is set to reach zero infections, Rio de Janeiro is experiencing a resurgence in new reported HIV cases among MSM. San Francisco’s success can be attributed to effective biomedical interventions, namely: rapid diagnosis, immediate ART, sustained viral load suppression, wide uptake of PrEP, and interrupting new clusters of transmission. In Brazil, however, uptake of these biomedical interventions has so far been insufficient to reverse the epidemic, despite being the first low/middle income country to provide free ART to all persons with HIV, participation in clinical trials proving PrEP efficacy, and national policy to provide free PrEP. Meanwhile, young MSM, particularly Black/Afro-Brazilians, have high HIV incidence, low viral suppression, and poor PrEP adherence. We therefore propose collaborative research between the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro. We will focus on identifying the drivers of HIV infection, ways to address barriers to biomedical interventions, and identifying the hurdles to including young MSM in biomedical research. Methods include a cross-sectional survey of MSM age 18-24 using respondent-driven sampling adapted for social media-based sampling; development of a technology-based rapid ART and PrEP engagement and retention intervention; and a qualitative study of MSM age 15-17, their parents, and providers of sexual health services to better understand the onset of risk and the feasibility of increasing inclusion of minors in biomedical HIV research and intervention programs. San Francisco stands as an American test case for the elimination of HIV, yet remaining challenges exist in reaching young and minority MSM. Rio de Janeiro is an engine of HIV research in South America, yet faces challenges in reaping the benefit of proven biomedical interventions for MSM. The proposed US-Brazil research collaboration will provide mutual benefit in increasing the effectiveness of biomedical interventions to reverse the HIV epidemic among MSM in Brazil and address remaining disparities in the US. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to start a line of research to help turn the tide on the HIV epidemic among young men who have sex with men (MSM) in Brazil. Researchers from the San Francisco health department will team up with scientists in Rio de Janeiro. Three joint projects are proposed: a survey of young MSM to measure the onset of risk for HIV, the development of a social media application to link young men to HIV care and PrEP, and an investigation of the concerns of parents, doctors, and young MSM about including minors in biomedical HIV programs and research.","San Francisco-Rio de Janeiro collaborative research on HIV prevalence, risk, and biomedical prevention interventions among young men who have sex with men",9888943,R01AI149627,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brazil ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' South America ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Policies ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Viral ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' population based ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' social media ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' acute infection ', ' ']",NIAID,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2020,113000,-0.04943686365752179
"Enhancing Partner Services among Men Who Have Sex with Men Living With HIV: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Project title: Enhancing Partner Services among Men Who Have Sex with Men Living With HIV: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Despite global efforts to control HIV among key populations, new infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) are still increasing. To deal with this challenge, HIV prevention strategies with high efficacy are urgently needed. Partner services (PS), the process of informing potential risk of exposure to sexual partners, is a cornerstone of HIV prevention. PS are important for identifying cases, reducing re-infection rates, promoting linkage to care, and reducing costs. However, barriers from both health providers and index cases limit the efficacy of PS. As a result, PS is underused in many countries, including China where only 16% of index HIV case spouses were notified. Crowdsourcing can be used to improve the effectiveness of PS. Crowdsourcing is an approach that obtains solutions from communities. Crowdsourcing has been used effectively in public health to improve HIV testing, promote condom use, and monitor outbreaks. As a bottom-up approach, crowdsourcing can effectively engage MSM and other stakeholders to contribute their voices to enhance understanding of HIV PS and design participant-oriented interventions. Crowdsourced messages developed for PS may resonate more strongly with MSM compared to traditional PS messages. In turn, this could lead to increased community participation and acceptance of HIV PS, improving the effectiveness of HIV PS. We hypothesize that a crowdsourced HIV PS approach is feasible and acceptable. We also hypothesize that, as compared to conventional PS using referral cards (standard of care in China), will yield: a) more sexual partners reporting for HIV testing, and b) more sexual partners with confirmed HIV. Our multi-disciplinary research team brings together crowdsourcing and PS experience, a history of working with MSM in China, and a rich local infrastructure for HIV research, to investigate the following aims: (1) to develop a crowdsourced PS intervention for Chinese MSM using open contests; (2) to test the feasibility, acceptability and pilot the preliminary impact of crowdsourced PS with conventional PS on promoting HIV testing uptake among partners of newly identified MSM cases using a pilot randomized controlled trial. In this pilot project, we will first use open contests to develop a crowdsourced PS intervention for Chinese MSM, then we will conduct a pilot RCT in which index MSM cases are randomized to receive crowdsourced intervention or standard of care in a ratio of 2:1. The project will develop crowdsourced intervention strategies for promoting HIV PS, and collect preliminary data for a full RCT that aims to further evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of crowdsourced PS in multiple Chinese cities. 澳 Public Health Relevance Statement: Project Narrative: Despite the investment of considerable resources in improving HIV partner services, there remains a large gap in the effectiveness of current HIV PS among men who have sex with men in low and middle-income countries. This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of crowdsourced PS, and observe whether the crowdsourced PS can result in greater HIV testing uptake among partners of index MSM HIV cases.",Enhancing Partner Services among Men Who Have Sex with Men Living With HIV: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,9991921,R34MH119963,"['China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Cities ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Computers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Entrepreneurship ', ' Entrepreneurial Skill ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Specialist ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' uptake ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Notification ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' service intervention ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' hack day ', ' hackfest ', ' hackathon ', ' study population ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R34,2020,185516,0.08208703072220515
"A couples-based approach to HIV prevention for transgender women and their male partners Transgender (`trans') women (i.e., individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity who were assigned male at birth) are among the populations at highest risk for HIV in the United States and worldwide. One of the most consistently reported contexts for HIV transmission among trans women is within a primary partnership with a non-transgender male. Despite the critical importance of primary partnerships for HIV prevention, the vast majority of HIV prevention studies and interventions for trans women have been individually-focused. For the past 10 years we have conducted research to identify intervention targets for reducing HIV transmission among trans women and their male partners using qualitative, survey, and intervention adaptation methodologies (R01DA018621; R34MH093232). Based on our conceptual and empirical understandings of HIV transmission risks among these couples, we recently developed and pilot tested the first known couples- based HIV prevention intervention for trans women and their male primary partner dyads (called “Couples HIV Intervention Program”; CHIP), which was feasible, acceptable, and produced significant reductions in sexual risk behavior compared to the control group. Based on our highly successful R34 findings, we propose to test the efficacy of the CHIP program in large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to reduce HIV risk among seroconcordant negative and serodiscordant couples. We will enroll racially diverse trans women and their male partners and randomize couples to either the CHIP intervention or an enhanced standard of care (SOC) control condition. Couples will be followed quarterly over 12-months. Analysis of study outcomes will utilize both individual- and dyadic-level data. Our primary outcome is a composite measure of risk for HIV transmission which encompasses validated behavioral indicators of HIV risk as well as biomedical confirmation of viral suppression and PrEP adherence. The CHIP intervention builds on years of formative work that targets interpersonal and social factors as mechanisms of HIV risk behavior among trans women and their male partners. If the CHIP intervention demonstrates efficacy in comparison to an enhanced SOC control condition, there will be support for implementing this approach within HIV prevention and care settings in order to reduce disparities in HIV transmission and acquisition among some of the highest priority HIV prevention populations. Transgender women (i.e., individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity who were assigned male at birth) are disproportionately affected by HIV and transmission risk has been attributed to a primary partnership with a non-transgender male. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of our promising couples-focused HIV prevention intervention to reduce HIV transmission risk among transgender women and their primary male partners by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies to help couples chose the most appropriate HIV prevention plan for their relationship.",A couples-based approach to HIV

"MWCCS ETOH supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching strategy of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) clinical research site (CRS) together with our collaborative clinical site at The Ohio State University (OSU) of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Woman’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS CCS) is to support, complement and accelerate the CCS unified scientific agenda (USA) by leveraging the strengths and scientific expertise of CRS investigators. We propose to continue to expand on our 35 years of extensive research on the natural history of HIV infection. The central hypothesis of this grant application is that, as men and women with chronic HIV infection age, they increase their risks for serious, life-shortening comorbidities beyond those of comparable age, uninfected persons, and this could differ between men and women. As directed by NIH RFA- HL-19-008, the CRS will provide robust and inclusive leadership focused on five specific aims of the USA, and targeted collaborative support for the five other aims, to improve our understanding of the epidemiologic, clinical, virologic, immunologic, and behavioral relationships of HIV infection to chronic comorbidities in men and women that represent the current HIV epidemic in the United States. The CRS will also contribute longitudinal data and biological specimens for collaborative research projects on HIV led by CCS and non-CCS investigators. This research is important to fulfill our mission of improving clinical management, increasing survival and controlling, preventing and curing HIV infection. The CRS will provide the most current and innovative epidemiological, clinical and laboratory methods and psychosocial research protocols to accomplish our 5 leadership specific aims. The Pitt/OSU CRS will be led by a triumvirate of MPIs and several CoIs with broad expertise needed to lead five highly specialized CCS USA Specific Aims (Aim 2: Pulmonary/Sleep [Morris]; Aim 3: Neurocognitive [Becker]; Aim 6: HIV/Pathogenesis [Macatangay]; Aim 7: Psychosocial [Stall]; Aim 9: Platform [Rinaldo, Kingsley]) and to provide insight for the 5 other Specific Aims (Aim 1: Cardiovascular [Kingsley, Martinson], Aim 4: Aging [Koletar], Aim 5: Cancer [Jenkins], Aim 8: Health Disparities [Krier], Aim 10: Career Development [Sluis- Cremer]. With this plan the Pitt/OSU CRS addresses the basic justification of the FOA, i.e., that the impact of HIV, its treatment, and the legacy of immune suppression need to be more fully understood to optimize the health of people living with HIV. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scientific leadership and methods implemented by the Pitt/OSU CRS will enable the MACS/WIHS CCS to answer important questions relevant to treated HIV-infected MSM, the group with the highest HIV incidence in the US, and questions about the interaction of HIV and aging, important as the HIV-infected population shifts into older ages. The proposed research will provide information for development and administration of new interventions for HIV, as well as for the prevention of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining outcomes.",MWCCS ETOH supplement,10130223,U01HL146208,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Ethanol ', ' Absolute ethanol ', ' ETOH ', ' Ethyl Alcohol ', ' Grain Alcohol ', ' Methylcarbinol ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Ohio ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Natural History ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Life ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Clinical Virology ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Women’s Interagency HIV Study ', ' The Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2020,157146,0.01295194298821177

"Using Longitudinal Research to Engage African American and Latinx Sexual- and Gender-Minority Youth in the HIV Prevention and Care Continua and Reduce HIV/AIDS-Related Disparities The U.S. has set a goal to end the HIV epidemic by the year 2030, which can be achieved but only if targeted approaches are implemented with at-risk populations to address known barriers of engagement along the HIV prevention and care continua. Populations of greatest concern include young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially YMSM of color, who now account for the vast majority of new HIV infections each year. Transgender and gender non-conforming/non-binary youth are also at high risk for HIV acquisition, accounting for an increasing proportion of new infections each year. In 2015, we were awarded a grant from NIDA to establish a new cohort of 448 African American/Black (AA/B) and Latino YMSM, called the Healthy Young Men’s (HYM) Cohort. We also received an administrative supplement to collect two waves of data from a smaller cohort of B/AA and Latinx 108 transgender and gender nonconforming/non-binary youth (TGMY), called the TRUTH Cohort. Both HYM and TRUTH participants were 16 to 24 years of age at the time of recruitment. The overarching aim was to conduct longitudinal research focused on these youths’ engagement in the HIV prevention and care continua in an effort to prevent new HIV infections, reduce transmission, and reduce HIV/AIDS-related disparities. Mixed methods research is conducted using qualitative interviews, a self- report survey, drug screening, and testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Biospecimens (plasma, buffy coat, rectal swabs) are also collected and banked. Analyses performed to date provide clear evidence that participants in both cohorts are at high risk for HIV, drug use, and mental health/psychiatric conditions. Intersectional stigma—i.e., experiences of stigma stemming from multiple, intersecting identities1- 5—also appears to discourage AA/B and Latinx YMSM and TGMY from engaging in care and perhaps may impact their developmental arcs of risk, transmission, and health. Building on this work, we are proposing to longitudinally: i) examine B/L-YMSM’s engagement in the HIV prevention and care continua, as well as their developmental transitions and trajectories in drug use, STI/HIV infection, health, and psychiatric/mental health comorbidities (Aim 1); ii) examine TGMY’s engagement in the HIV prevention and care continua and identify shared and unique transitions and trajectories with respect to TGMY’s use of drugs, infections with STI/HIV, health and psychiatric/mental health comorbidities (Aim 2); and iii) serve as a local and national resource for collaborations and dissemination. We will actively participate in and contribute to the Collaborating Consortium of Cohorts Producing NIDA Opportunities (C3PNO), the Coordinating Center for NIDA’s U01 cohorts. We will also partner with key stakeholders (e.g., community organizations, policy makers) and collaborate with trainees, early career faculty and investigators across the translational spectrum (Aim 3). Narrative The U.S. has set a goal to end the HIV epidemic by the year 2030, which can be achieved but only if targeted approaches are implemented with at-risk populations to address known barriers of engagement along the HIV prevention and care continua. The proposed research will inform efforts to reduce HIV/STI risk and transmission, reduce HIV/AIDS disease progression, reduce drug use and mental health co-morbidities, and improve the health and quality of life of HIV+ among at-risk youth.",Using Longitudinal Research to Engage African American and Latinx Sexual- and Gender-Minority Youth in the HIV Prevention and Care Continua and Reduce HIV/AIDS-Related Disparities,9997642,U01DA036926,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Color ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Immigration ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Los Angeles ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' rectal ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Disease Progression ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' interest ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Swab ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' drug detection ', ' drug testing ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' sexually transmitted HIV ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' gender minority ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' anxious ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' marijuana use ', ' early-career faculty ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' translational spectrum ', ' translational pipeline ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' Drug Screening ', ' food insecurity ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIDA,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,U01,2020,3471813,-0.02002012126578217
"Multilevel Comprehensive HIV Prevention for South African Adolescent Girls and Young Women ABSTRACT  Reducing new HIV and STI infections among South African (SA) adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) is global public health priority.1 SA has world's largest HIV epidemic,2,3 and SA AGYW acquire HIV at twice the rate of and seroconvert on average 5 – 7 years earlier than male peers.3 As new infections continue to outpace access to and availability of PrEP and ART, primary prevention remains the most viable strategy to stem new transmissions.1,4,5 SA efforts to prevent HIV transmission in youth focus mostly on individual-level behavior change,6-8 but AGYW's persistent HIV disparities are explained by broad social and structural inequities that shape and constrain HIV-risk behaviors.9-14 Comprehensive HIV prevention packages that are integrated, synergistic, and tailored to the local epidemiology and cultural context are likely to achieve and sustain maximum reductions in HIV-risk.15-22 Female caregivers (FC) are an untapped resource in the HIV prevention toolbox23,24 and offer a novel opportunity to strengthen AGYW prevention efforts. AGYW may also be change agents for their FC who want to be positive role models for AGYW, and thus, adopt HIV prevention behaviors, including HTC and PrEP. Guided by an ecological framework, our highly experienced multidisciplinary team will adapt (phase 1/UG3) and evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of (phase 2/UH3) IMARA, a multilevel, innovative, family-based HIV prevention program that targets individual, social, and structural drivers of risk to decrease HIV and STI incident infections, reduce risky sexual behavior, and increase HTC and PrEP uptake (where appropriate) in AGYW and FC. IMARA demonstrated a 45% reduction in incident STI at 12-month follow-up among black 14-18 year-old girls in the US, and increased HIV testing in FC. Pilot data with 71 AGYW and FC at the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation (DTHF; study site) confirm feasibility and acceptability of IMARA for the South African context. This study will be integrated into the adolescent-friendly services at DTHF in the Western Cape metropolitan area facilitating sustainability if effective. Using the ADAPT-ITT model, we will systematically tailor IMARA for the SA context and then conduct a 2-arm RCT with 300 15-19 year-old AGYW and FC. FC and AGYW will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month assessments, including testing for 3 STI. We will offer HTC and PrEP at each assessment and track uptake and linkage to care. AGYW and FC who test positive for a STI and/or HIV will receive free treatment at DTHF. We will collect data to determine the costs of IMARA. Analyses will compare AGYW and FC across the intervention and control programs on sexual risk taking, STI and HIV incidence, PrEP and HTC uptake, and theoretical mediators. The study answers an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combination HIV prevention packages for AGYW to achieve an AIDS-free generation. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE  Reducing new HIV and STI infections among South African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) is global public health priority.1 SA has world's largest HIV epidemic,2,3 and SA AGYW acquire HIV at twice the rate of and seroconvert on average 5 – 7 years earlier than male peers.3 15-19 year-old females account for over two thirds of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa,25 but only 15% know their HIV status.26 HIV mortality is rising among adolescents while decreasing for every other age group. As new infections continue to outpace access to and availability of PrEP and ART, primary prevention remains the most viable strategy to stem new transmissions.1,4,5 SA efforts to prevent HIV transmission in youth focus mostly on individual-level behavior change,6-8 but AGYW's persistent HIV disparities are explained by broad social and structural inequities that shape and constrain HIV-risk behaviors.9-14 Comprehensive HIV prevention packages that are integrated, synergistic, and tailored to the local epidemiology and cultural context are likely to achieve and sustain maximum reductions in HIV-risk.15-22 Female caregivers are an untapped resource in the HIV prevention toolbox23,24 and offer a novel opportunity to strengthen AGYW prevention efforts, particularly for uptake of new biomedical technologies like PrEP and HIV testing and counseling. AGYW may also be change agents for female caregivers who want to be positive role models for AGYW and thus, change their own behavior to practice HIV prevention. Establishing the cost- effectiveness of comprehensive HIV prevention packages will inform sustainment over time.27,28 This application will adapt and evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a family-based HIV prevention package for AGYW and female caregivers.

"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities ABSTRACT The Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) vision as detailed in our current Strategic Plan is “leading the creation and advancement of health equity”. To accomplish this vision, and ultimately health equity, new structures are required. More rapid translation of research discoveries has been facilitated through a “team-based approach” to address the health of the people and communities. This means bringing biomedical, clinical, and behavioral investigators and others together in Multidisciplinary Translational Teams (MDTT’s) focused on a health disparity that bring to bear their combined expertise to address populations health translating discoveries into practical solutions. MSM RCMI Program has been successful at developing research infrastructure including researchers. This application has been developed to bring the expertise of the RCMI Program Cores, with Community and Clinical researchers and partners to build Multidisciplinary Translational Teams across the T spectrum targeted at more rapid translation of health disparities (e.g., Cancer, Stroke, Infectious Diseases, Cardiometabolic Disease, Reproductive Health) by expanding the baseline research infrastructure established by Morehouse School of Medicine. The primary objectives are to build those teams through research projects targeted at health disparities, and to develop a pipeline of developing research teams at MSM, and to increase the level of involvement of investigators in conducting MDTT research at MSM. The U54 Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities (CTRHD) consists of five Cores (Administrative, Research Infrastructure, Investigation Development, Community Engagement, and Recruitment); Three Research Projects; an evaluation component attached to the Administrative Core, and a Pilot Project Program attached to the Investigator Development Core. With these assets and activities, the CTRHD will accomplish its goal through the following Aims: AIM 1: Transform Our Institution. Build processes and structures facilitating development of competitive multidisciplinary translational teams (MDTTs), allowing MSM to emerge as the preeminent, research-intensive, minority serving academic health center in the nation. AIM 2: Transform the MSM Research Environment. Develop collaborations allowing MSM faculty to do cutting edge translational health disparities research. AIM 3: Transform the Community of Scientists.

"Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men ABSTRACT From 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among MSM aged 13-24 years old more than doubled. There are stark racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections among YMSM; 13- 24 year old racial and ethnic minority MSM now represent a rapidly growing share of all new HIV infections. Although the likelihood of HIV acquisition is greater at older ages, many of the cognitive and behavioral risk factors that contribute to the risk of HIV infection rates develop in adolescence. As adolescent MSM (AMSM; 13-18 years old) begin to develop and express gender and sexual identities, to experiment and begin sexual behaviors, and to begin to establish a sense of self, there is the opportunity to parallel this period of growth with targeted, tailored interventions that equip AMSM with the life skills they need to reduce their vulnerability to HIV risk and to establish the life skills necessary to manage risk. We developed a mobile-friendly WebApp intervention focused on life skills training (iCON) across 16 topics, ranging from stigma and discrimination to sexual health, with links to local resources. In the proposed activities, we will adapt iCON for four U.S regions heavily impacted by HIV, and revise the content to include materials that are age-appropriate for 13 to 18 year- olds. Given the role that stigma and social isolation plays in the lives of many AMSM, we also propose to embed a peer-to-peer motivational interviewing component to iCON, allowing participants to access motivational interviewing counseling via VSee video-chat. With a large and diverse sample (n=500), we will test the efficacy of the intervention, now referred to as iCON+, on cognitive and behavioral HIV-related outcomes using a two-arm randomized control design. In addition, we examine whether structural characteristics in a region (e.g., race/ethnicity segregation, HIV prevalence) influence the efficacy of the proposed intervention. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Adapt a multilevel, online life skills intervention (iCON+) to address HIV vulnerability among AMSM living in four heavily impacted regions constituting diverse racial/ethnic and geographic areas (Chicago-Detroit; Atlanta-Washington, DC; Memphis- New Orleans; San Francisco-San Diego) in the US. (2) Test the efficacy of iCON+, as compared to a delayed intervention condition, to improve cognitive (e.g., comfort discussing sexuality; HIV prevention attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, behavioral intentions) and behavioral (e.g., condom use, HIV testing, PrEP use) factors using a prospective RCT design. (3) Examine the differential efficacy of iCON+ in improving psychosocial mediators (e.g., personal competency) associated with our outcomes and (4) Examine how socio-ecological determinants at the individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, urbanity) and regional (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, HIV prevalence) level are associated with iCON+'s efficacy. PROJECT RELEVANCE Consistent with the National HIV/AIDS Prevention Plan's call to reduce new HIV infections by intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities where HIV is most heavily concentrated, we propose to deliver and test a life skills intervention targeting the key domains that fuel HIV disparities among adolescent MSM in the United States. This RCT will yield important information regarding the delivery of a developmentally-appropriate HIV prevention program that reaches racial/ethnic and socioeconomically diverse sample of AMSM across four regions in the United States.",Reducing HIV vulnerability through a multilevel life skills intervention for adolescent men,9877964,U01MD011274,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence

"Development and testing of a mobile application to enhance HIV prevention cascade in Malaysian MSM Abstract  Malaysia’s HIV epidemic is rapidly expanding with recent evidence suggesting accelerated sexual transmission, especially in MSM: 10% in 2008 to 54% in 2016. Evidence suggests high HIV prevalence in MSM being nationally (21.6%) and in Kuala Lumpur (43%). Central to this expanding HIV epidemic in MSM is condomless sex, STIs, and co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders (P/SUD), especially depression and amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use. Insights into Malaysia’s HIV prevention gap are multi-factorial. Both homosexuality and substance use is criminalized in Malaysia, making MSM bear the dual burden of stigma and discrimination, including in healthcare, which promotes P/SUD disparities in MSM. MSM are often hesitant to disclose their sexuality, risk behaviors or depressive symptoms, mostly due to fear of stigma, discrimination, or criminalization. Stigma and discrimination are also enacted on MSM by healthcare providers resulting in extraordinary health disparities and low prevention uptake. Strategies that facilitate screening and prevention practices in a non-judgmental fashion are likely to increase access to evidence-based prevention like HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), especially if screening and counseling addresses P/SUD. Introducing an innovative app-based platform to deliver holistic HIV prevention services represents a paradigm shift in HIV prevention since it can deliver effective prevention in a confidential, less-stigmatizing and convenient manner. Building on the advantages for scalability and dissemination afforded using app platform, we propose to develop and test the efficacy of a clinic-affiliated app (myCareLink) to deliver an integrated HIV prevention intervention that will promote HIV testing and linkage to PrEP and incorporates screening and support for underlying P/SUD in Malaysian MSM. The design of this study will take place in 2 phases. The R21 phase will consist of 2 stages: 1) We will adapt, expand and refine an existing app, which will be integrated within the existing clinical care system. First, we will conduct focus groups with MSM (n=25) and stakeholders (n=10) to theater test the existing app to develop an interactive prototype of the myCareLink app (alpha version). Then, the prototype will undergo usability testing (n=20), followed by the full development of the app (beta version); 2) Expanded Beta testing (n=50) of the myCareLink app will assess its usability and acceptability. The R33 phase will involve conducting a Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Science Trial to evaluate the efficacy of myCareLink app vs. treatment as usual (TAU) in 268 Malaysian MSM for primary (HIV testing and PrEP uptake) and secondary (PrEP adherence and persistence) efficacy outcomes. Multi-level implementation outcomes will involve stakeholders’ perspective of the relative advantage of myCareLink app over TAU, adaptability, perceived design quality and packaging, compatibility in the Malaysian context, interest in sharing the app with others and readiness for implementation. Research capacity strengthening between Yale and the University of Malaya will occur through collaborative learning between researchers at both institutions to promote expansion of mHealth research. Narrative  The proposed research focuses on developing and prospectively testing the efficacy of a clinic-affiliated app (myCareLink) to deliver an integrated HIV prevention intervention in Malaysian MSM. We expect that this project will lead to the development of an innovative and culturally tailored app that will promote HIV testing and linkage to PrEP by addressing co-morbid psychiatric and

"Timely monitoring and response to HIV transmission networks for intensified prevention PROJECT SUMMARY  Tracking population-based HIV transmission dynamics is critical to design and monitor effective interventions. Despite widespread prevention, HIV incidence has failed to decline among some subgroups in the United States (US) including young men who have sex with men (MSM). Such disparities are notable in the Southern US which is at the epicenter of the national epidemic with the greatest burden in new and prevalent infections. Significant disparities in HIV infection exist based on race/ethnicity and risk behaviors, but also in geography; a higher proportion of cases are reported outside large urban areas compared to other regions.  Delineating HIV transmission dynamics in the Southern US can identify ongoing transmission networks or clusters where targeted prevention measures may be more impactful at reducing local incidence. However, the success of such measures requires timely identification and response to emerging or expanding clusters. Prospective phylogenetic analyses of HIV sequences integrated with epidemiologic and clinical surveillance data would facilitate the timely detection and monitoring of transmission networks. When combined with phylodynamic modeling, cluster expansion and transmission dynamics could be better predicted and the impact of interventions assessed.  Our overall hypotheses are: 1) Prospective phylogenetic cluster analysis allows timely identification of transmission chains not apparent through routine surveillance, 2) Persons identified in expanding clusters represent the leading edge of local transmission, i.e. recent infection, 3) Targeting prevention towards growing clusters will identify a higher proportion of recent infections and ultimately reduce incidence. These hypotheses will be addressed in North Carolina (NC) with three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe the demographic and geographical characteristics of HIV transmission involving persons with newly reported HIV infection using phylogenetic clustering, viral load, and risk behaviors; Aim 2: To assess HIV cluster expansion and inform phylodynamic models by integrating large-scale deep sequencing and contact networks involving cases with newly diagnosed HIV infection; Aim 3: To conduct a preliminary assessment of a cluster-directed partner services intervention to interrupt HIV transmission networks.  These aims will be addressed through a combination of strategies in collaboration with the NC Department of Health and Human Services. A statewide prospective, automated cluster analysis system (nextHIV) will be evaluated. Sequences from reference laboratories and deep sequencing of diagnostic specimens from public testing sites will be analyzed in near-real time. Clusters will be characterized with detailed epidemiological data including HIV viral loads and contact networks. A proof-of-concept, cluster-directed partner services intervention will be assessed in an 11 county region with high HIV burden. Phylodynamic and mathematical modeling will be used to assess cluster expansion and the potential impact of interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV transmission continues in the Southern US despite comprehensive prevention. New strategies are needed to detect and respond to ongoing transmission networks to ultimately reduce HIV incidence. Combining epidemiological data, HIV sequence analyses, and mathematical modeling into an automated surveillance system can provide timely detection of networks and help assess the impact of interventions.",Timely monitoring and response to HIV transmission networks for intensified prevention,9882951,R01AI135970,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Contact Tracing ', ' Communicable Disease Contact Tracing ', ' Infectious Disease Contact Tracing ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Specialist ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Annual Reports ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' deep sequencing ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' demographics ', ' service intervention ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' surveillance data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' STD prevention ', ' prevent sexually transmitted disease ', ' prevent sexually transmitted infections ', ' sexually transmitted disease prevention ', ' sexually transmitted infection prevention ', ' STI prevention ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,906049,0.025071014921993578
"Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men  The overarching goal of this proposed study is to leverage existing and ongoing data to examine the role of sexual behavior stigma on access to HIV healthcare as well as sexual and mental health outcomes among men who have sex with men (MSM). Worldwide MSM are a key population that bear a disproportionate burden of HIV with high prevalence and incidence yet they have low uptake and/or access to treatment and prevention. Consistent with NIH HIV/AIDS research priorities, the proposed project aims to reduce health disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes by addressing stigma towards MSM in the context of intersecting stigmas and potentially modifiable mediators (e.g., depression). In particular, validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed to effectively measure stigma-related interventions and to better understand the mechanisms of how stigma potentiates HIV risks among this key population. We propose to leverage existing data collected from over 15,000 MSM across 7 different Sub-Saharan African nations, the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS), the UCLA mSTUDY, and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 078 study on Enhancing Recruitment, Linkage to Care and Treatment for HIV-Infected MSM in the US. The specific aims of the work are: Aim 1) Develop validated measures used to assess sexual behavior stigma among MSM using factor analysis and validity and reliability testing. This will result in finalized stigma metrics and recommendations for integration of MSM stigma items that can be used in future studies. Aim 2) Identify specific mediated associations between stigma and HIV-related outcomes using structural equation modeling. In addition, test for intersectionality of multiple forms of stigma (e.g., gender, HIV status, race/ethnicity) using an inter- and intra-categorical approach. The delivered outcomes will include quantified associations of sexual behavior stigma with HIV-related outcomes that can be used to inform HIV intervention planning by setting feasible targets for stigma mitigation interventions. Aim 3) Include final validated stigma metrics in an upcoming cycle of AMIS and bio-validate the stigma metrics. Bio-validation will consist of testing associations of sexual behavior stigma with testing positive for sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia and gonorrhea), and with chronic stress measured using telomere DNA length. Participants will self-collect urine, rectal, and saliva specimens using home-based STI test kits. Overall, the proposed study will result in a thorough assessment of a sexual behavior stigma scale for MSM and how it operates comparatively with other types of stigma. The validated stigma metrics will provide recommendations for future studies that seek to measure stigma and its relation to HIV among this key population. The World Health Organization, UNAIDS, and the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy have collectively called for the need to reduce stigma towards MSM as a vital component of an effective HIV response. Consistent and validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed in the context of multiple intersecting stigmas; therefore, the proposed research project will develop, test, and validate sexual behavior stigma metrics using existing and ongoing data collected across Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. Using bio- specimens collected in the American Men's Internet Survey, the proposed project will additionally contribute to the understanding of relationships between stigma and risk for chronic stress and sexually transmitted infections among this key population.",Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men ,10141488,R01MH110358,"['Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Population Programs ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rectal ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Priority ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' comparative ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' HIV prevention trials network ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' sexual role ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,168535,0.03682825900432039
"PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Young Black MSM: Neighborhood and Network Determinants PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods, social and sexual networks, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence cross-sectionally and longitudinally among young Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Chicago IL metropolitan statistical area (MSA) followed over two years. We will enroll 350 Black MSM in the proposed NIH-funded uConnect Neighborhoods and Networks Cohort Study to address the aims of the research. Eligibility requirements include: HIV-seronegative; self-report no restrictions to usual physical activity; no plans to move outside of Chicago IL MSA in the next two years; and willingness to complete a two-week GPS protocol at nine time-points over two years. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols we have used in our previous feasibility research projects, including studies among Black MSM. In this longitudinal study, three months after completing the initial 2-week GPS protocol, participants will carry the GPS device for an additional 2-weeks every three-months over the two-year study period—for a total of nine times. GPS activity space environment and social/sexual networks data at baseline could potentially influence PrEP outcomes over time. Also, multiple GPS measures and social/sexual networks (at different time points) can better capture the breadth of people’s exposure to neighborhood-level factors and dynamics in social/sexual networks. The proposed study will be the largest GPS study of HIV disparities in any MSM population and presents a remarkable opportunity to study environmental influences on HIV prevention. Findings from the proposed research will impact HIV prevention intervention activities. First, it will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increased community efforts to combat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender hate crime neighborhood rates through increased local police attention in high- crime locations may be an HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV health disparities. Second, from the GPS dataset we will know the travel patterns of Black MSM and therefore be able to identify optimal geographic locations for HIV prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions are seldom geographically targeted. Third, this research will facilitate the identification of geographic locations suitable for recruiting Black MSM in research studies, an improved method of venue- based sampling, in this understudied population. Fourth, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces changes or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. Changing risk environments would suggest that prevention requires significant dynamism and fluidity, as well as rapid change-detection feedback loops. Finally, our dynamic network analysis we propose will deepen understanding of the effects of social and sexual networks on HIV prevention behaviors and will improve network-based HIV prevention interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between GPS-defined activity space neighborhoods, social and sexual networks, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and adherence among young Black MSM in the Chicago IL metropolitan statistical area, a population in the United States heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS.",PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Young Black MSM: Neighborhood and Network Determinants,10131506,R01MH112406,"['Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Polygamy ', ' Poverty ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' life-style risk reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' fluidity ', ' success ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' combat ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' built environment ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' Global Positioning System ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' social factors ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' hate crimes ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,657921,0.011187088742983907
"Malaysian Implementation Science Training (MIST) Program in HIV Despite an array of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to address HIV – and the 90/90/90 strategy – the HIV epidemic in Malaysia remains volatile. With over 100,000 cumulative HIV cases, Malaysia's rapidly expanding HIV epidemic is the fifth largest in the Asia-Pacific region and concentrated within the most-at-risk populations, including people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), and female sex workers (FSW). This is attributed to an inadequate scale up of EBIs, including access to HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), antiretroviral therapy, needle/syringe exchange programs (NSEPs) – to meet HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Therefore, given the need to expand EBIs into the continuum of HIV care in Malaysia, it is critical that we invest in implementation science and the next generation of researchers to curtail the burden of HIV disease. Thus, we propose to develop and institutionalize the Malaysian Implementation Science Training (MIST) at the University of Malaya (UM) – the first training on HIV and implementation science that incorporates human rights training in Malaysia – in collaboration with Yale University. MIST will leverage the combined resources of Yale University (Schools of Medicine and Public Health) with the UM, a leading research and training university in the Asia/Pacific region. The MIST training program will use experts in implementation science from Yale University and introduce a hybrid training program between Yale and UM to initially train UM faculty in implementation and train the next generation of researchers and implementers to have the skills to address the HIV prevention and treatment cascade of care. Specifically, MIST adheres to three core aims, including: 1) train 10 Implementation Research Scholars (IRS) and 4 Implementation Research Faculty (IRF) by integrating an advance training in HIV implementation science from Yale School of Medicine; 2) transfer knowledge and build capacity for the UM Certification in HIV Implementation Science; and 3) develop the Implementation Science Resource Hub to consolidate resources and build partnership for better population outcomes. We will create a regional hub for implementation science by providing advanced training for faculty (who are not yet expert in implementation science), doctoral level training and capacity development of students at a renowned public health university that is at the forefront of dynamic sociocultural, religious and political shifts. Building on over 13 years of successful collaborations and partnerships in medical and public health research for key populations, with or at risk for HIV, we are poised to focus implementation science to overcome health disparities for PWID, MSM, FSW, transgender populations and prisoners, and provide advanced training to produce a phased transfer of knowledge, skills and expertise from Yale to UM over the course of five years, resulting in a model curriculum for training in Malaysia at the top university in Malaysia is led and sustained by regional and local faculty with strong community, government and international partnerships. Narrative This project aims to develop and institutionalize the Malaysian Implementation Science Training (MIST) – the first training on HIV and implementation science that incorporates human rights training in Malaysia. The proposed research is relevant to the HIV research priorities identified by NIH as it provides advanced training to the next generation of researchers and public health professionals in Malaysia to have the skills necessary to address health disparities and to improve HIV care continuum among key populations.",Malaysian Implementation Science Training (MIST) Program in HIV,9999881,D43TW011324,"['Asia ', ' Certification ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Epidemic ', ' Faculty ', ' Government ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Human Rights ', ' Hybrids ', ' Malaysia ', ' Federation of Malaya ', ' Malay Federation ', ' Malaya ', ' Needles ', ' Politics ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' jail inmate ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Students ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Malaysian ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Syringe-Exchange Programs ', ' needle exchange ', ' syringe exchange ', ' syringe exchange services ', ' syringe service programs ', ' Needle-Exchange Programs ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' PWID ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' skills ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' implementation research ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' public health research ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Training ', ' faculty development ', ' faculty professional development ', ' instructor training ', ' teacher development ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' faculty research ', ' international research partnership ', ' international partnership ', ' female sex worker ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",FIC,YALE UNIVERSITY,D43,2020,298129,0.021338685679582962
"Getting Off: A Theory-based mHealth Intervention for Methamphetamine-using MSM Abstract Methamphetamine (MA) use among men who have sex with men (MSM) is associated with increased rates of HIV prevalence and transmission, as well as substandard advancement along the HIV Prevention and Care Continua. MA use among MSM is deeply integrated into socio-sexual networks including the use of smartphone applications (“app”) and websites to find sexual partners. Given the growth of mobile health technology, it is no longer necessary or reasonable to limit MA treatment options to physical sites, clustered in urban areas, and administered using generic, non-tailored content. The project builds upon the established efficacy of our manualized MA-abuse treatment intervention, “Getting Off: A Behavioral Treatment Intervention for Gay and Bisexual Male Methamphetamine Users,” and the highly promising findings from our successful Stage I proof-of-concept study, to complete translation of Getting Off into a cross-platform (iOS and Android) app and assess the app’s efficacy and non-inferiority in a scientifically rigorous randomized trial. The Getting Off app, like the group-based intervention before it, will use the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Theory and Stages of Change to help MSM reduce or eliminate MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increase advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum (including uptake of HIV testing, pre-, and post- exposure prophylaxis [PEP/PrEP] and PrEP adherence and persistence for those who are HIV negative; ART uptake and adherence for those who are HIV positive). This project will 1) refine and enhance the first 8 sessions of the Getting Off MA-abuse treatment intervention developed in Stage I based on feasibility pilot test user feedback, 2) conduct formative research to develop the remaining 16 sessions of the Getting Off MA- abuse treatment intervention into a cross-platform computerized mobile app targeted to reduce MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increase advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum, and 3) conduct a RCT to evaluate reductions of MA use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increased advancement along the HIV Prevention or Care Continuum, using three approaches: a) Efficacy Trial – a two-arm RCT to determine intervention effects through comparison of the Immediate Delivery (ID; n=150) and Delayed Delivery (DD; n=150) arms; b) Efficacy Trial – an observed treatment effects analysis to compare pre/post data from the pooled ID and DD conditions (N=300); and, c) Non-inferiority Trial – a two-arm historical matched comparison design to evaluate the outcomes of the Getting Off app (ID + DD; N=300) relative to a matched sample of participants having previously attended the brick-and-mortar group-based Getting Off intervention (N~600; total N=900). The RCT uses repeated measures to assess participants at baseline, 1-, 2- (DD condition only), 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-up. This study could have significant public health impact by greatly expanding access to effective, affordable, private, culturally competent and highly scalable MA treatment to this very high-risk population. Project Narrative Methamphetamine (MA) use among MSM is strongly associated with HIV infection and interrupted progression along the HIV Prevention and Care Continua. This study will complete the development and evaluation of an evidence-based, theory-driven, and culturally competent treatment app for MA-using MSM, designed to reduce or eliminate MA use and HIV sexual risks, increase uptake of HIV testing and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP), including PrEP adherence and persistence for those who are HIV negative, and increase retention in HIV care and adherence to ART for those who are HIV positive. Given the severe personal and public health consequences of MA use, the public health significance of this app is very high as it will provide this population with a tailored treatment opportunity that is easily accessible, affordable, private, and highly scalable.",Getting Off: A Theory-based mHealth Intervention for Methamphetamine-using MSM,9920698,R01DA045562,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies Promising new tools for HIV prevention and treatment have stimulated global initiatives to “End the HIV Epidemic” and reach the “End of AIDS;” however, significant challenges to ending the global HIV epidemic remain. Biomedical advances for prevention and treatment will not reach their full potential without rigorous behavioral and social science research to optimize uptake, adherence, and equitable and effective implementation and scale-up. Thus, we propose a renewed HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies that expands on our history of conducting interdisciplinary HIV research and leverages new partnerships to maximize the potential of biomedical advances, addressing their availability and acceptability to the most vulnerable populations. The HIV Center is unique among NIMH AIDS Research Centers (ARCs) in being based in New York City (NYC), a continuing US AIDS epicenter in a state that has the greatest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, including ethnic/racial minority populations coping with extreme economic, health, and social disparities. In 2014, HIV Center investigators and other academicians, providers, advocates, and policy-makers joined the Office of the Governor of New York State (NYS) to develop a NYS Blueprint for Ending the Epidemic (EtE). The Blueprint provides the HIV Center with the unique opportunity to use our home city and state as a “laboratory” to study implementation of EtE initiatives and apply lessons learned to US and global epidemics. Thus, in the next five years, the HIV Center will be guided by the theme, The Science of Ending the HIV/AIDS Epidemic (EtE): Efficacy to Effectiveness at Scale, and its emphasis on implementation research and research at the intersection of behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences.  The HIV Center brings together a cadre of investigators at the forefront of multiple disciplines to address three Specific Aims: (1) to catalyze intervention and implementation science research necessary to achieve EtE goals; (2) to translate research into culturally and structurally competent practice and policy for maximum public health impact; and (3) to increase the capacity of current and future generations of scientists, service providers, and community and policy leaders to create and implement biomedical, behavioral, social, and structural HIV prevention and treatment interventions to meet EtE goals. Our Cores ensure methodological and theoretical rigor, identify and rapidly respond to new trends in the epidemic, support critical research- practice partnerships, and train new scientists. We complement the Administrative and Development Cores with three Research Cores: (1) Statistics, Assessment, and Data Management (StAD) Core, focused on innovative analytic, assessment, and data management strategies; (2) Bio-Behavioral Core, focused on research at the interface of the biomedical and the behavioral and social sciences; and (3) Implementation Science and Health Outcomes (ISHO) Core focused on effective, sustained, and equitable achievement of HIV prevention and care outcomes at scale. The HIV Center will continue as a global leader in HIV prevention and the fight to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV-related health and social disparities that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable – women, youth, racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations, and other disenfranchised groups.

"Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS Abstract/Summary Since the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, it has supported a diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings, contributing significantly to scientific knowledge of HIV risk and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in highly impacted groups and settings. In the next five years, CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social and biomedical approaches, and the implementation of HIV prevention and treatment as well as the elimination of HIV disparities. We will leverage the extensive multi-disciplinary expertise of our scientists and partners to have a greater impact on the global epidemic through contextualized Implementation Science (IS) and ongoing support of interdisciplinary HIV research education and training programs, with emphasis on training for underrepresented minorities to diversify the field of HIV research. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in New England, we will continue to develop and support the New England HIV Implementation Science Network, a regional network of HIV researchers and service providers that we established in 2014 to focus on the conduct of implementation research in small urban centers with high HIV infection rates, e.g., Providence, RI and New Haven, CT. Network activities will augment other efforts to address implementation gaps in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy by supporting the development and implementation of effective HIV interventions tailored to small cities/towns and other understudied communities. While focusing on the New England region, we will seek to become a national resource for IS research on the HIV epidemic, generating studies with findings of potential applicability to other highly impacted areas such as the southern parts of the U.S. We will focus on drivers of the epidemic and use the expertise of CIRA scientists to address the intertwined issues of substance use, mental health and stigma, and the impact of the current opioid epidemic on HIV risk and incidence. Our global research will also focus on advancing IS and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, thus supporting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals and priorities in the 2017 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV Research. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical and Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods. Each core will support and build capacity for IS research. We will embed Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) approaches into strategic planning and evaluation processes to optimize Center efficiency and services. Core specific and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project Narrative Recent advances in HIV science make ending the epidemic achievable, yet barriers to implementing proven strategies in practice persist. HIV disparities, rising incidence of HIV in young MSM, increasingly complex HIV co-morbidities, the opioid epidemic, the aging of the HIV population, and the need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public health.

"A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM Project Summary  Adolescent (ages 13-18) men who have sex with men (AMSM) experience a dramatic health disparity as they represent 2% of young people but account for almost 80% of HIV diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based HIV prevention programs. Implementation issues are critical as traditional HIV prevention delivery channels (community organizations, schools, parents), have significant limitations when it comes to AMSM. eHealth interventions represent an excellent modality for delivering AMSM-specific intervention material where youth “are.”  We should not continue to deliver the same intervention when a participant is not responding. Rather, stepped-care strategies increase in intensity to meet the needs of those who do not respond to a less intense intervention. Using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, we will evaluate the impact of a package of increasingly intensive interventions that have already shown evidence of efficacy with diverse adolescent and young adult MSM. The SMART design is an ideal approach to achieve the goals of this RFA because SMART designs mimic treatment decisions as they are made in real-world clinical settings. Collectively we brand our package of eHealth interventions as the SMART Program (Sexual Minority Adolescent Risk Taking). The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis. Public Health Relevance Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group among youth in the US and rates of infections are increasing, however, few HIV prevention programs have been developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve public health by establishing the effectiveness of an innovative, eHealth HIV prevention program for YMSM.",A Pragmatic Trial of An Adaptive eHealth HIV Prevention Program for Diverse Adolescent MSM,9870799,U01MD011281,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Magic ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' sexually active ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' community organizations ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' queer ', ' trial design ', ' AMSM ', ' adolescent MSM ', ' adolescent men who have sex with men ', ' recruit ', ' program costs ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' effectiveness implementation trial ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2020,1640794,0.03355851604940887
"Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men  The overarching goal of this proposed study is to leverage existing and ongoing data to examine the role of sexual behavior stigma on access to HIV healthcare as well as sexual and mental health outcomes among men who have sex with men (MSM). Worldwide MSM are a key population that bear a disproportionate burden of HIV with high prevalence and incidence yet they have low uptake and/or access to treatment and prevention. Consistent with NIH HIV/AIDS research priorities, the proposed project aims to reduce health disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes by addressing stigma towards MSM in the context of intersecting stigmas and potentially modifiable mediators (e.g., depression). In particular, validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed to effectively measure stigma-related interventions and to better understand the mechanisms of how stigma potentiates HIV risks among this key population. We propose to leverage existing data collected from over 15,000 MSM across 7 different Sub-Saharan African nations, the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS), the UCLA mSTUDY, and the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 078 study on Enhancing Recruitment, Linkage to Care and Treatment for HIV-Infected MSM in the US. The specific aims of the work are: Aim 1) Develop validated measures used to assess sexual behavior stigma among MSM using factor analysis and validity and reliability testing. This will result in finalized stigma metrics and recommendations for integration of MSM stigma items that can be used in future studies. Aim 2) Identify specific mediated associations between stigma and HIV-related outcomes using structural equation modeling. In addition, test for intersectionality of multiple forms of stigma (e.g., gender, HIV status, race/ethnicity) using an inter- and intra-categorical approach. The delivered outcomes will include quantified associations of sexual behavior stigma with HIV-related outcomes that can be used to inform HIV intervention planning by setting feasible targets for stigma mitigation interventions. Aim 3) Include final validated stigma metrics in an upcoming cycle of AMIS and bio-validate the stigma metrics. Bio-validation will consist of testing associations of sexual behavior stigma with testing positive for sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia and gonorrhea), and with chronic stress measured using telomere DNA length. Participants will self-collect urine, rectal, and saliva specimens using home-based STI test kits. Overall, the proposed study will result in a thorough assessment of a sexual behavior stigma scale for MSM and how it operates comparatively with other types of stigma. The validated stigma metrics will provide recommendations for future studies that seek to measure stigma and its relation to HIV among this key population. The World Health Organization, UNAIDS, and the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy have collectively called for the need to reduce stigma towards MSM as a vital component of an effective HIV response. Consistent and validated measures of sexual behavior stigma are needed in the context of multiple intersecting stigmas; therefore, the proposed research project will develop, test, and validate sexual behavior stigma metrics using existing and ongoing data collected across Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. Using bio- specimens collected in the American Men's Internet Survey, the proposed project will additionally contribute to the understanding of relationships between stigma and risk for chronic stress and sexually transmitted infections among this key population.",Validation of Stigma Metrics for Marginalized Men ,9867747,R01MH110358,"['Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Population Programs ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rectal ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Priority ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' comparative ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' HIV prevention trials network ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' sexual role ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,675256,0.03682825900432039
"HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies Promising new tools for HIV prevention and treatment have stimulated global initiatives to “End the HIV Epidemic” and reach the “End of AIDS;” however, significant challenges to ending the global HIV epidemic remain. Biomedical advances for prevention and treatment will not reach their full potential without rigorous behavioral and social science research to optimize uptake, adherence, and equitable and effective implementation and scale-up. Thus, we propose a renewed HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies that expands on our history of conducting interdisciplinary HIV research and leverages new partnerships to maximize the potential of biomedical advances, addressing their availability and acceptability to the most vulnerable populations. The HIV Center is unique among NIMH AIDS Research Centers (ARCs) in being based in New York City (NYC), a continuing US AIDS epicenter in a state that has the greatest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, including ethnic/racial minority populations coping with extreme economic, health, and social disparities. In 2014, HIV Center investigators and other academicians, providers, advocates, and policy-makers joined the Office of the Governor of New York State (NYS) to develop a NYS Blueprint for Ending the Epidemic (EtE). The Blueprint provides the HIV Center with the unique opportunity to use our home city and state as a “laboratory” to study implementation of EtE initiatives and apply lessons learned to US and global epidemics. Thus, in the next five years, the HIV Center will be guided by the theme, The Science of Ending the HIV/AIDS Epidemic (EtE): Efficacy to Effectiveness at Scale, and its emphasis on implementation research and research at the intersection of behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences.  The HIV Center brings together a cadre of investigators at the forefront of multiple disciplines to address three Specific Aims: (1) to catalyze intervention and implementation science research necessary to achieve EtE goals; (2) to translate research into culturally and structurally competent practice and policy for maximum public health impact; and (3) to increase the capacity of current and future generations of scientists, service providers, and community and policy leaders to create and implement biomedical, behavioral, social, and structural HIV prevention and treatment interventions to meet EtE goals. Our Cores ensure methodological and theoretical rigor, identify and rapidly respond to new trends in the epidemic, support critical research- practice partnerships, and train new scientists. We complement the Administrative and Development Cores with three Research Cores: (1) Statistics, Assessment, and Data Management (StAD) Core, focused on innovative analytic, assessment, and data management strategies; (2) Bio-Behavioral Core, focused on research at the interface of the biomedical and the behavioral and social sciences; and (3) Implementation Science and Health Outcomes (ISHO) Core focused on effective, sustained, and equitable achievement of HIV prevention and care outcomes at scale. The HIV Center will continue as a global leader in HIV prevention and the fight to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV-related health and social disparities that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable – women, youth, racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations, and other disenfranchised groups. We will work to meet “Ending the HIV Epidemic” goals by synergizing institutional and intellectual resources; invigorating our multidisciplinary community of scientists, clinicians, and policy-makers; rigorously training a new generation of scientists; supporting research partnerships with public health policy and practice sectors; and translating transformative NIH-supported HIV/AIDS research into real-world practice and policy.

Our global research will also focus on advancing IS and cost-effective, sustainable HIV interventions in low resource settings, thus supporting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals and priorities in the 2017 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV Research. CIRA's new mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five cores: Administrative, Development, Community Research and Implementation, Clinical and Health Services Research, and Interdisciplinary Research Methods. Each core will support and build capacity for IS research. We will embed Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) approaches into strategic planning and evaluation processes to optimize Center efficiency and services. Core specific and center-wide impact will be measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project Narrative Recent advances in HIV science make ending the epidemic achievable, yet barriers to implementing proven strategies in practice persist. HIV disparities, rising incidence of HIV in young MSM, increasingly complex HIV co-morbidities, the opioid epidemic, the aging of the HIV population, and the need for cost-effective approaches present continuing challenges to public health. CIRA will provide a nexus for scientific inquiry and research collaborations to advance implementation of effective solutions to the epidemic in the U.S and globally.",Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS,9886262,P30MH062294,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Boston ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' Area ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Distance Learning ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' R25 Program ', ' Education Projects ', ' International ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Community Practice ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Clinical Services ', ' implementation research ', ' next generation ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' academic program ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer coaching ', ' education research ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' service providers ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,1946947,0.04003735705383595
"A pragmatic trial of two strategies for implementing an effective eHealth HIV prevention program Despite evidence that eHealth approaches can be effective in reducing HIV risk, their implementation requirements do not fit within established strategies for public health scale up—leaving it an open question as to how to bring these programs into practice. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address this need by developing and evaluating novel strategies for implementing eHealth HIV prevention programs. Keep It Up! (KIU!) is an online program proven to reduce HIV risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), including YMSM at elevated HIV risk due to behaviors (i.e., condomless sex, substance use) and demographics (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities). Strong evidence of effectiveness on behavioral and biomedical outcomes makes KIU! an ideal eHealth intervention for implementation science. Lessons learned will set the pathway for implementation of the many HIV eHealth programs currently undergoing efficacy testing.  Through formative research with community-based organizations (CBOs), health departments, the CDC, and researchers we have identified two pragmatic implementation strategies that we will evaluate and compare: Strategy 1: CBOs apply for, and are selected for, funding to deliver KIU! through their current HIV testing programs. Strategy 2 is a “direct-to-consumer” (DTC) model where centralized staff recruit participants nationally through online advertising campaigns and manage engagement. HIV/STI testing kits are shipped directly to YMSM and, upon documentation of an HIV negative test result, participants are delivered KIU!  Aim 1: Compare two implementation strategies using a cluster randomized trial. 75 counties with large YMSM populations will be randomized 2:1 to strategy 1 (CBO) or strategy 2 (DTC). KIU! will be delivered in each county for two years. In this cluster randomized trial, the unit of randomization is the county, with implementation and effectiveness outcome data collected from YMSM participants, CBOs, and the technology vendor. Our primary outcomes are public health impact (defined as reach X effectiveness) and cost per infection averted. We will also collect and report as secondary outcomes multiple metrics of reach, effectiveness, and implementation.  Aim 2: Examine adoption characteristics that explain variability in implementation outcomes. We will conduct mixed-methods research on the domains from the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to explain variability in implementation success. Data on CFIR characteristics will be collected through administrative data, and surveys and telephone interviews with key stakeholders.  We will also explore maintenance/sustainment of KIU! at the completion of the study. CBOs will be provided with materials to facilitate applying for external funding to continue to provide KIU! after study completion, including an Impact Tool to estimate local impact and costs. Through expert consultation we will examine models for ongoing sustainment of the DTC model. NIH has made a significant investment in developing and testing the efficacy of eHealth HIV prevention and care programs, but little is known about how to scale out and implement these programs once they are proven effective. The proposed study will lead the way in understanding implementation of eHealth interventions by testing two pragmatic strategies for delivering the Keep It Up! 3.0 program. Prior studies has demonstrated the effectiveness of Keep It Up! at reducing HIV risk among diverse young men who have sex with men, making it an ideal intervention for implementation science research.",A pragmatic trial of two strategies for implementing an effective eHealth HIV prevention program,9972969,R01MH118213,"['Adoption ', ' Advertising ', ' Behavior ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Ships ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vendor ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Test Result ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Equipoise ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' arm ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' implementation strategy ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,1891888,0.004074842505205641
"A Sequential Mixed Methods Study Evaluating the Influence of Violence on HIV Care and Viral Suppression among Young Black and Latinx MSM Abstract  Viral suppression is critical to the national HIV prevention strategy in the United States, where it is estimated that just about half of people living with HIV (PLWH) are virally suppressed. The vast majority of PLWH are men who have sex with men (MSM). There are marked race- and ethnicity-based disparities in HIV prevalence, care engagement, retention, and subsequent viral suppression among MSM. Compared with White MSM, HIV-infected Black and Latinx MSM are significantly less likely to achieve viral suppression. Relative to older Black and Latinx MSM living with HIV, Black and Latinx MSM aged 13-24 years have low rates of linkage to care, retention in care, and viral suppression.  In addition to race- and sexual orientation-based discrimination, Black and Latinx MSM experience other forms of violence that may adversely impact HIV care-related outcomes, such as intimate partner violence and community violence. There are almost no studies that have simultaneously studied community violence (including stigma and discrimination) and intimate partner violence among young minority MSM.  The overarching aim of the proposed sequential mixed methods research is to characterize, over time and space, experiences of violence (i.e., intimate partner and sexual, community, and race- and sexual orientation- based violence) and how these experiences influence HIV care among young Black and Latinx MSM living with HIV. These results will yield an empirical basis for interventions and policies to fill gaps in the care continuum among young Black and Latinx MSM.  The Specific Aims of the study are: Aim 1: Geolocate the spaces where young Black and Latinx MSMLWH experience violence and characterize how they interpret and assess the impact of those experiences on health, well-being, and HIV care-related outcomes. Aim 2: Assess associations among violence experiences and HIV care-related outcomes over time and space.  To achieve these aims, we will conduct a sequential mixed methods study. At baseline, 50 young Black and Latinx MSMLWH will complete a brief baseline computer-assisted survey instrument (CASI); a community asset and risk mapping using Google Earth; a blood draw; and a qualitative in-depth interview (IDI). Between the baseline visit and 3-month follow-up, participants will prospectively complete daily diaries and geospatial mapping, in real time, using a smartphone app, geolocating the precise times and locations of violence experiences and characterizing their emotional and other responses. At the 3-month follow-up, participants will complete another CASI, blood draw, and in-depth qualitative interview. With the CASI, diary, and app-based data, we will characterize statistical associations among participant-level violence experiences, subjective responses, area-level characteristics (via census data) and HIV care-related outcomes (self-reported ART adherence, medical appointment attendance, and HIV viral load, assessed via quantitative HIV-1 RNA by PCR). IDI data will contextualize mapping data, at baseline, and diary and app data, at follow-up. As an exploratory aim, we will ideate location-specific, visual- or social media-based messages to reduce exposure to violence and/or address the psychosocial impacts via a design charrette where preliminary results and exemplary campaigns are presented and novel ideas are generated and discussed. Project Narrative The study purpose is to examine whether violence affects how HIV-positive young Black and Latino gay men in New York City get their HIV care, including taking HIV drugs as prescribed, being retained in HIV care, and getting undetectable HIV viral load. The study will involve interviews, spatial mapping, and a daily diary and mapping smartphone app. This study will provide information on how to design programs to improve HIV care among young minority gay men.",A Sequential Mixed Methods Study Evaluating the Influence of Violence on HIV Care and Viral Suppression among Young Black and Latinx MSM,10082309,R21MH124474,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies Promising new tools for HIV prevention and treatment have stimulated global initiatives to “End the HIV Epidemic” and reach the “End of AIDS;” however, significant challenges to ending the global HIV epidemic remain. Biomedical advances for prevention and treatment will not reach their full potential without rigorous behavioral and social science research to optimize uptake, adherence, and equitable and effective implementation and scale-up. Thus, we propose a renewed HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies that expands on our history of conducting interdisciplinary HIV research and leverages new partnerships to maximize the potential of biomedical advances, addressing their availability and acceptability to the most vulnerable populations. The HIV Center is unique among NIMH AIDS Research Centers (ARCs) in being based in New York City (NYC), a continuing US AIDS epicenter in a state that has the greatest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, including ethnic/racial minority populations coping with extreme economic, health, and social disparities. In 2014, HIV Center investigators and other academicians, providers, advocates, and policy-makers joined the Office of the Governor of New York State (NYS) to develop a NYS Blueprint for Ending the Epidemic (EtE). The Blueprint provides the HIV Center with the unique opportunity to use our home city and state as a “laboratory” to study implementation of EtE initiatives and apply lessons learned to US and global epidemics. Thus, in the next five years, the HIV Center will be guided by the theme, The Science of Ending the HIV/AIDS Epidemic (EtE): Efficacy to Effectiveness at Scale, and its emphasis on implementation research and research at the intersection of behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences.  The HIV Center brings together a cadre of investigators at the forefront of multiple disciplines to address three Specific Aims: (1) to catalyze intervention and implementation science research necessary to achieve EtE goals; (2) to translate research into culturally and structurally competent practice and policy for maximum public health impact; and (3) to increase the capacity of current and future generations of scientists, service providers, and community and policy leaders to create and implement biomedical, behavioral, social, and structural HIV prevention and treatment interventions to meet EtE goals. Our Cores ensure methodological and theoretical rigor, identify and rapidly respond to new trends in the epidemic, support critical research- practice partnerships, and train new scientists. We complement the Administrative and Development Cores with three Research Cores: (1) Statistics, Assessment, and Data Management (StAD) Core, focused on innovative analytic, assessment, and data management strategies; (2) Bio-Behavioral Core, focused on research at the interface of the biomedical and the behavioral and social sciences; and (3) Implementation Science and Health Outcomes (ISHO) Core focused on effective, sustained, and equitable achievement of HIV prevention and care outcomes at scale. The HIV Center will continue as a global leader in HIV prevention and the fight to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV-related health and social disparities that disproportionately burden the most vulnerable – women, youth, racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations, and other disenfranchised groups. We will work to meet “Ending the HIV Epidemic” goals by synergizing institutional and intellectual resources; invigorating our multidisciplinary community of scientists, clinicians, and policy-makers; rigorously training a new generation of scientists; supporting research partnerships with public health policy and practice sectors; and translating transformative NIH-supported HIV/AIDS research into real-world practice and policy. We will apply the lessons learned from our research to improve the health and well being of all affected by the HIV epidemic, regardless of where they reside.",HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies,10220420,P30MH043520,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personnel Management ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P30 Protein ', ' Generations ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' economic analysis ', ' economic evaluation ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' fighting ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Future Generations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' health economics ', ' implementation research ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' social disparities ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community based service ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' health practice ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' social science research ', ' sexual minority ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' service providers ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P30,2020,250768,0.04694597226673286
"Developing efficient intervention technologies to reduce stigma-related stress, mental health problems, and HIV risk among young Chinese MSM PROJECT SUMMARY Background. HIV prevalence among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in China has increased from less than 1.0% in 2003 to 9.2% in 2016. Lack of action will lead to 1 in 6 Chinese MSM being infected with HIV by 2025; the majority will be young (YMSM). Stigma fuels China’s HIV epidemic among YMSM. Chinese YMSM face a lack of equal rights and legal protections, identity concealment is normative, and conversion therapy is widespread. Chinese values of filial piety and norm conformity further strain YMSM. This stigma gives rise to minority stress reactions, including identity concealment, internalized homonegativity, and sensitivity to identity-based rejection. Both minority stress and associated poor mental health compromise YMSM’s HIV prevention through avoidance coping, low self-worth, impulsivity, and unassertiveness. Our team has created the first intervention tested for efficacy with YMSM that addresses these minority stress reactions and related processes. This cognitive-behavioral (CBT) intervention, called ESTEEM, shows strong preliminary efficacy across minority stress, mental health, and HIV risk behavior. Yet, ESTEEM was developed in the US and currently requires in-person delivery of 10 1-hour sessions, precluding widespread implementation in China. Now, advancements in our research allow us to prepare ESTEEM for broad reach. Preliminary Studies. First, we culturally adapted in-person ESTEEM for Chinese YMSM across an 8-stage adaptation process with YMSM and stakeholders (n=56), including a small open pilot with Chinese YMSM (n=8). Second, we worked with our colleagues in Sweden – world leaders in internet-based CBT (iCBT) – to create an iCBT version of ESTEEM. iCBT combines a self-guided mobile platform with brief counselor feedback and online exercises and homework, requiring 80% less counselor time than in-person ESTEEM. In a small US pilot (n=10), iCBT ESTEEM was highly functional. We incorporate these advances to develop Chinese ESTEEM iCBT – a highly efficient, private intervention that addresses minority stress and mental health as HIV prevention. Aims. (1) Transform our recently created Chinese ESTEEM in-person materials (e.g., manual, handouts) into iCBT content (e.g., self-guided exercises, videos) and ensure its comprehension (n=10 YMSM). (2) Test the initial efficacy of Chinese ESTEEM iCBT for reducing at-risk YMSM’s past-90-day HIV-risk behavior, against a weekly self-monitoring control. (3) Identify implementation barriers and facilitators of Chinese ESTEEM iCBT through analysis of Aim 2 data (e.g., counselor fidelity) and qualitative interviews with Aim 2 participants (n=20), counselors (n=4), government stakeholders (e.g., Chinese CDC, medical clinic staff, n=12), and implementing partners (e.g., HIV-prevention NGOs, LGBTQ centers, n=12). In developing a highly efficient platform to disseminate our minority stress-mental health intervention, we also position ourselves for sustained future collaboration, including on research to study the ultimate uptake of this intervention in established settings across China and other low/middle-income countries severely affected by HIV. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at rapidly increasing risk of HIV infection in China, largely due to stigma and associated minority stressors and barriers to mental and sexual health. Our program of research has set the stage for now preliminarily testing the efficacy of the first minority stress-mental health intervention for YMSM in Asia with high potential to reduce YMSM’s behavioral HIV risk. Delivering this intervention using a mobile platform requiring few provider resources ensures high reach and scalability, paving the way for future dissemination across China and other high-stigma low/middle-income countries severely affected by HIV.","Developing efficient intervention technologies to reduce stigma-related stress, mental health problems, and HIV risk among young Chinese MSM",10055475,R21TW011762,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asia ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Epidemic ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Government ', ' Health Services ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Interview ', ' Manuals ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Education ', ' Stress ', ' Sweden ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' TimeLine ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' anal intercourse ', ' Anal Sex ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV risk ', ' Impulsivity ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Minority ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' stem ', ' implementation science ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' same-sex marriage ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' Same-sex ', ' anxious ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' internet platform ', ' web platform ', ' ']",FIC,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,246845,0.005340200307656959
"Unpacking the Mechanisms of Disparities for HIV-related Hypertension in African American and Asian Pacific American MSM The literature reveals that hypertension (HTN) is considerably higher among HIV-positive individuals than HIV-negative individuals. However, the systemic/individual determinants (including behavioral, clinical, macro- social, and psychosocial factors) for this health co-morbidity is not fully understood in the literature. To fill these scientific gaps, we propose to use a longitudinal design to systematically examine a systemic/individual approach -- modeling after the NIMHD’s “Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework” -- to examine and elucidate the multiple determinants of HTN observed in two ethnic-sexual men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV/AIDS. To that end, we will address three specific aims and hypotheses: Aim 1: To examine the association of macro-social determinants (i.e., homophobia, racial/ethnic discrimination), behavioral risk factors (e.g., substance misuse), and psychosocial factors (e.g., stress) with HTN among a cohort of African American or AA (200 AA in Philadelphia) and Asian Pacific Americans or APA (200 APA in Honolulu) MSM living with HIV -- We hypothesize that greater exposure to homophobia and racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with a greater prevalence of HTN among HIV-positive MSM. Aim 2: To determine the underlying systemic/individual determinants which account for the relationship between inflammation and HTN over time, given common forms of hypertension have been postulated to be immune mediated -- We hypothesize that the greater exposure to homophobia and racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (D-dimer, hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, P-selectin), where they mediate HTN among these men. Aims 3: To examine whether associations between these factors and health outcomes are moderated by coping and social support -- We hypothesize that greater social support would mitigate HTN among these men. This is the first study that uses systemic/individual and multi-disciplinary approaches to examine the impact of multiple determinants on HTN co-morbidity over time among AA and APA MSM living with HIV. Our multi-disciplinary team with expertise in HIV prevention science, clinical HIV medicine, ethnic-sexual MSM, and chronic diseases are uniquely positioned to address risk and protective factors of multiple influences of HTN co-morbidity over time among AA and APA MSM with HIV. By conceptually and empirically testing novel hypotheses, we will provide evidence of etiology and validated tools and measures that advance our understanding of mechanisms of disparities in HIV-related co-morbidities. Findings from this longitudinal observational study will inform the management of HIV and its HTN co-morbidity as a chronic disease, especially among the two disparity groups of MSM (AA and APA) who continue to bear the burden of health disparities. This study is guided by NIMHD’s conceptual framework to address multiple influences of health disparities on HTN comorbidity among HIV-positive MSM disparity populations. Our knowledge of the of systemic/individual determinants on “… the effect of HIV related co-morbidities on the complexity of HIV/AIDS diseases progression” is not fully understood. Given these scientific gaps, we propose to use a longitudinal design to systematically examine a systemic/individual approach -- modeling after the NIMHD’s “Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework” -- to examine and elucidate the multiple determinants including behavioral, clinical, macro-social, and psychosocial factors -- herein known as “systemic/individual determinants) of hypertension observed among a cohort of racial/ethnic (African American; Asian Pacific American) men who have sex with men living with HIV/AIDS in two metropolitan cities (Philadelphia and

"Mentoring in patient-oriented research on HIV and global health PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this K24 mid-career investigator award is to support Dr. Bassett’s mentoring activities and patient-oriented research to improve engagement in HIV care and related conditions globally. Dr. Bassett is a practicing Infectious Disease physician with over 14 years of experience leading clinical research in South Africa related to HIV and TB screening and treatment, for which she received the HIV Medicine Association Research Award in 2015. She has served as a mentor to 15 young investigators, four of whom are currently supported by K awards. Dr. Bassett is deeply committed to continuing and further expanding her mentorship to include trainees from outside of Infectious Disease and those based in sub-Saharan Africa. She has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of advisors who can support her and her trainees’ career development. Dr. Bassett is the Director of the Harvard Center for AIDS Research Developmental Core and its Mentoring Programs, and directs a mock K grant review session three times yearly as well as a grant-writing workshop for the Harvard community. She won the Harvard Medical School Young Mentor Award in 2013 in recognition of her mentoring activities. She proposes an inter-related set of training, mentoring and research objectives that expand the scope of her research into new areas (e.g. HIV prevention, community-based treatment for HIV- associated non-communicable diseases). This K24 would provide Dr. Bassett with: 1) protected time for mentoring early career investigators dedicated to patient-oriented HIV research, including those based in sub- Saharan Africa, 2) a platform for mid-career professional development in mixed methods, implementation science approaches, and expanded mentorship and international partnerships, and 3) an opportunity for new data collection to inform her mentees’ and her own future research programs. Dr. Bassett will leverage her collaborations and partnerships in Umlazi Township, Durban, South Africa, a community with a high HIV burden and one of the highest HIV incidences among young women in the world. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop innovative, community-based research that addresses fundamental questions about how to improve uptake of HIV prevention and long-term ART provision, as well as how to integrate other critical health needs such as diabetes management and contraception into HIV programs. The proposed high- impact research has direct and immediate application in a high-risk South African township and will support the protected time and resources required for Dr. Bassett to mentor young investigators from both the US and sub- Saharan Africa in patient-oriented research. PROJECT NARRATIVE While sub-Saharan African countries have made great strides in creating successful national HIV care programs, rigorous research is needed to evaluate how best to incorporate HIV prevention, HIV treatment, and HIV-related non-communicable disease care into community-based settings. Dr. Bassett has a long and successful track record mentoring trainees and is deeply committed to expanding this mentoring. She will harness her long-standing collaborations in a community with a high HIV burden to evaluate strategies for improving access to HIV prevention and long-term treatment and to mentor the next generation of patient- oriented researchers.",Mentoring in patient-oriented research on HIV and global health,9889026,K24AI141036,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infection ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Activity spaces for HIV risk and prevention among diverse men who have sex with men in Los Angeles Abstract One of the key strategies to ending the HIV epidemic in the United States is to increase investments in geographic hotspots, or areas of elevated disease burden. However, a few key challenges limit the ability for hotspot mapping to inform effective HIV interventions. First, hotspot mapping typically uses residential address of an individual with an incident infection. Yet for many individuals, potential risky sex and drug-use behaviors do not occur at home. Identifying the places in which risk occurs, as opposed to where an individual who engages in risk lives, will help target and increase exposure to place-based interventions. Second, individual behavior is often constrained or dictated by larger socio-ecological factors, and these can work together to create or maintain health disparities. Interventions tailored to risk hotspots to improve the HIV care cascade need to be responsive to the broader socio-ecological context of the hotspot. Third, an implicit assumption about prioritizing hotspots for interventions is that efforts to reduce incidence in hotspots will indirectly reduce incidence elsewhere as well, as infections likely spread from high incidence areas to neighboring lower prevalence areas. Information on potential geographic and sexual network connectivity between hotspots and other places can inform prioritization of risk hotspots for HIV interventions. We will demonstrate innovative methods to identify and prioritize HIV risk hotspots among urban, non-white men who have sex with men (MSM), populations at especially high-risk for HIV in the United States. We will leverage and supplement existing longitudinal data on non-White MSM, both HIV-infected and uninfected, from the ongoing mStudy cohort in Los Angeles, to achieve our goals. We will first adapt an existing web-based activity space survey of HIV risk and prevention to incorporate geographic characteristics of networks, residential mobility, and locations of drug use. Then we will use cognitive interviews to validate the survey instrument, and collect data from 250 MSM using the updated survey. Second, we will identify and describe HIV transmission and acquisition risk hotspots within Los Angeles County, using individual activity space data on sexual risk and drug use locations, neighborhood characteristics of the hotspots, and sociodemographic characteristics and behaviors of individuals engaging in risk in the hotspots. Third, we will estimate connectivity of hotspots to other locations (e.g., other hotspots, residential locations, and prevention locations), in order to identify which hotspot to prioritize for maximizing intervention effectiveness over time and space. This work will improve the effectiveness of HIV prevention, care, and treatment strategies in two ways. First, it will guide decision making as to which hotspot to prioritize, by ranking them in terms of potential connectivity to other places, and thus maximizing the reach of the intervention. Second, it will inform which combination of interventions will be most successful, by characterizing the context and composition of the hotspot. Project Narrative This study will establish innovative ways to determine and prioritize geographic risk hotspots for HIV interventions among African American and Latinx men who have sex with men in order to improve the effectiveness of HIV prevention, care, and treatment strategies in two ways. First, it will guide decision making as to which hotspot to prioritize, by ranking them in terms of potential connectivity to other places, and thus maximizing the reach of the intervention.

"Estimating Mediation and Moderation Effects in HIV Incidence Prevention Trials Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this project is to analyze existing behavioral interventions designed to reduce HIV incidence in order to examine the mechanisms (i.e., mediators) that predict efficacy, and the subgroups for whom (i.e., moderators) interventions are efficacious. We propose to use advanced approaches to analyzing mediators and moderators. Specifically, we will utilize methods that allow indirect (mediated) effects to be directly tested and quantified, even in interventions that do not find a significant total X ÞY effect (i.e., efficacy). We propose to analyze data from four large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the efficacy of behavioral interventions on an HIV incidence outcome; two trials were showed a significant effect on HIV, two had null results on HIV. We will use the novel approach called “conditional process modeling” which simultaneously models mediators and moderators and tests both how and for whom an intervention works, helping to identify different processes leading to efficacy for different subgroups (AIM 1). We will compare the significant and the null trials in their significant mediators and moderators and model characteristics to examine possible situations of masked efficacy in the null trials (AIM 2). We will utilize cutting-edge advancements in causal mediation analysis. Specifically, we will conduct sensitivity analysis to estimate the extent to which a mediator is primarily responsible for producing effects on HIV, strengthening causal inference about mediators leading to reduced HIV transmission in the interventions (AIM 3). To our knowledge these novel statistical approaches have never been used to analyze mediators and moderators in HIV intervention RCTs. We will also explore the use of biomedical strategies as moderators of mediated pathways to explore whether participants who reported use of a biomedical tool show a different causal process in intervention efficacy (AIM 4). Understanding mediators and moderators of existing behavioral HIV prevention interventions will help to inform how to pare down or ramp up interventions to their most effective elements and which subgroups and contexts must be targeted to produce briefer, cheaper, and more impactful interventions. These interventions could be used in combination with biomedical prevention strategies.!By also analyzing biomedical tools (i.e., nPEP use and male circumcision status) as potential moderators of mediated effects, we gain valuable insight into whether and which behavioral mechanisms must be targeted in interventions when these specific biomedical strategies are used. To meet our aims we will analyze data from studies using the “gold-standard” method for evaluating HIV prevention interventions. Specifically, we will use data from four different two-arm RCTs that were powered to test HIV incidence as the primary outcome. These RCTs tested the efficacy of behavioral HIV prevention interventions among men who have sex with men in the U.S., men and women in South Africa and Uganda, and people who inject drugs in Ukraine.

"Developing Internet-Delivered, Mindfulness-based Intervention to Reduce HIV Risk and Promote Mental and Sexual Health among Young Adult MSM PROJECT SUMMARY Young men who have sex with men (YMSM; age 18-34) are disproportionately burdened by HIV. Minority stress and its “downstream” effects in YMSM, including mental health issues, sexual risk behaviors, and suboptimal HIV testing, contribute to the syndemic risks surrounding HIV. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), adapted for HIV prevention among YMSM and internet-based delivery to maximize reach and engagement, could offer an innovative and scalable method to address this public health issue. Consistent with NCCIH’s scientific priority in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion across Lifespan, the current project aims to develop an internet-delivered MBI for HIV prevention among distressed, high-risk YMSM. Specifically, this K23 will provide support for an early phase, exploratory clinical trial by adapting mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and conducting a feasibility trial among YMSM. Candidate: Dr. Sun is a clinical scientist with a research background in HIV prevention and mental health concerning minority populations and marginalized communities. In recent years, she has pursued clinical and research development in mindfulness. Building on her prior work, she is applying for a five-year K23 Career Development Award to obtain training, mentorship, and research experience to become an expert in adapting and evaluating internet-delivered MBI to address HIV-related health disparities and an independent investigator capable of R01 funding. Mentoring: A stellar team of senior investigators serve on the advisory panel. Drs. Don Operario and Judson Brewer are co-primary mentors, who have complimentary expertise in HIV prevention for MSM and internet-based MBI for behavioral health. Three co-mentors bring expertise in internet-based HIV intervention with young adults (Dr. Larry Brown), mindfulness for population health (Dr. Eric Loucks), and stress physiology (Dr. Audrey Tyrka). Research: Guided by the ADAPT-ITT model, the proposed project aims to (1) adapt MBSR for distressed, high risk YMSM and internet-delivery using focus groups with YMSM (n=30) and stakeholders (n=16), (2) refine the intervention protocol by administering adapted materials to distressed, high risk YMSM (n=18) and stakeholders (n=16) via theatre testing, and (3) examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted iMBI for HIV prevention by randomizing 40 distressed, high-risk YMSM to the iMBI (n=20) and a Health Education condition (n=20). The study will examine recruitment and retention, intervention adherence (e.g., attendance, at-home practice), completion of assessment (HIV testing, sexual risk behaviors, hair sample collection, mental health, minority stress and coping), and acceptability of the intervention. Trainings: Dr. Sun will receive training in MBSR, intervention adaptation and implementation for YMSM and internet-delivery, and a biopsychosocial-based understanding of stress through coursework, seminars, workshops, directed readings, and mentored research. Guided by an excellent mentorship team, these training and research experiences will establish the candidate’s career as an expert in HIV-related behavioral health and iMBI for minority health. The candidate is institutionally supported by Brown University School of Public Health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The HIV epidemic disproportionately affects young adult gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YMSM; age 18-34), a population largely impacted by stigma (i.e., minority stress) and mental health issues, both create a “syndemic” condition surrounding sexual risk behaviors and suboptimal HIV testing. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are efficacious in reducing psychological distress and promoting behavioral health, and successful adaptation of MBI for content and internet-delivery may offer an innovative, transdiagnostic, and scalable approach to reach YMSM and address this public health issue. Using an evidence-based adaptation model (ADAPT-ITT) for HIV behavioral health, the current project aims to systematically adapt mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), an empirically-supported intervention with efficacy, to the context of HIV prevention and minority stress reduction via internet-based delivery among distressed, high risk YMSM, followed by a randomized feasibility trial.","Developing Internet-Delivered, Mindfulness-based Intervention to Reduce HIV Risk and Promote Mental and Sexual Health among Young Adult MSM",10082672,K23AT011173,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages

"Addressing Latino MSM Health Disparities by Increasing Engagement with Behavioral and HIV-Prevention Services: An Implementation Science Approach PROJECT SUMMARY  Miami is an HIV hotspot, driven by HIV disparities among Latino men who have sex with men (MSM). Behavioral health problems (e.g., mental health, substance use) contribute to HIV acquisition, forming synergistic disparities. Yet, Latino MSM show delayed HIV testing and underutilize pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and behavioral health services, highlighting that existing implementation efforts inadequately reach this population. My preliminary data highlight multilevel, modifiable mechanisms that drive disparities in Latino MSM’s use of PrEP, HIV testing, and behavioral health services. To advance health disparities science and achieve the Ending the HIV Epidemic goals, tailored implementation strategies that address these mechanisms to ensure the equitable delivery of PrEP, HIV testing, and behavioral health services to Latino MSM must be developed and evaluated. Research Strategy. Aim 1: Discover the key components of a culturally tailored implementation strategy that addresses the mechanisms driving Latino MSM disparities in HIV-prevention and behavioral health service use. I will leverage my preliminary data to develop a culturally tailored implementation strategy, Dime Más (“Tell Me More”) with the goal of ensuring the equitable delivery of PrEP, HIV testing, and behavioral health services to Latino MSM. From my prior work, I anticipate Dime Más will involve Latino MSM outreach workers using techniques such as motivational interviewing, problem solving, and destigmatizing narratives to engage Latino MSM in services. Results of three phases of formative research (focus groups, demonstration and feedback sessions, and a feasibility test) will be used to iteratively refine Dime Más. Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the culturally tailored implementation strategy on Latino MSM disparities in service use. I will then conduct a pilot trial comparing Dime Más delivered by a Latino MSM outreach worker from our community partner site to standard community outreach only. Latino MSM will be randomized 1:1 to each condition (N=60, ~50% U.S. born). The trial will evaluate the impact of Dime Más on health disparities by examining PrEP, HIV testing, and behavioral health uptake across groups and exploring mechanisms of effects. We will also examine implementation outcomes (appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, cost) via exit interviews and surveys with participants and outreach workers. Outcomes. The proposed research and the associated training and mentoring activities will begin to elucidate the tailored strategies needed to overcome factors driving Latino MSM’s HIV and behavioral health disparities, while also building my expertise in using implementation research to advance health disparities science. With expert mentors, a strong HIV research infrastructure, solid community partnerships, and the urgent public health need to scale up PrEP, HIV testing, and behavioral health services to Latino MSM, I am well positioned to advance my research and training plan.The findings will lay the foundation for a subsequent R01 hybrid effectiveness- implementation trial, further advancing health disparities science and health equity for Latino MSM. Project Narrative Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) face substantial and growing HIV disparities, fueled by syndemic behavioral, interpersonal, and structural challenges. Despite this, HIV- prevention services (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis/PrEP, HIV testing) and evidence-based behavioral health treatments do not sufficiently reach Latino MSM. This proposal seeks to address this gap by developing and pilot testing a culturally tailored implementation strategy that seeks to increase PrEP, HIV-testing, and evidence-based behavioral health treatment uptake among Latino MSM, thereby mitigating health disparities.",Addressing Latino MSM Health Disparities by Increasing Engagement with Behavioral and HIV-Prevention Services: An Implementation Science Approach,10079954,K23MD015690,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Communities ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Immigration ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Motivation ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Privatization ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Research Activity ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV risk ', ' psychological distress ', ' behavioral health ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' trial comparing ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' health equity ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic identity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' health assessment ', ' implementation strategy ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' effectiveness implementation trial ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2020,159210,-0.014874916323640158
"A multicomponent intervention to address gender-based violence in HIV prevention for women PROJECT SUMMARY Transgender (`trans') women of color experience violence in a variety of contexts, including from partners, strangers, law enforcement, healthcare providers, and in public accommodations. Violence is consistently linked with HIV transmission risk and avoiding HIV prevention services via pathways including chronic stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and substance use. These epidemics are concurrent and mutually reinforcing, constituting a “syndemic” or synergistic interaction that contributes to documented inequities in HIV Prevention Continuum outcomes. In Detroit, Michigan, trans women of color are one of the `most-at-risk' groups for HIV, with significant disparities in sustained engagement in HIV prevention services. In this R21 exploratory/developmental research application, we propose to adapt, integrate, and pilot test a culturally-relevant evidence-based trauma-informed violence prevention intervention to improve HIV Prevention Continuum outcomes. Guided by the ADAPT-ITT model, our first aim seeks to conduct a systematic adaptation of three interventions and integrate these components into a trauma-informed combination prevention intervention for TWOC, with a focus on HIV Prevention Continuum outcomes by conducting interviews with trans women of color and key stakeholders to inform the adaptation. Our community advisory board consisting of trans women of color will review all adapted materials. The second aim seeks to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the trauma-informed combination prevention intervention in a one-arm pilot with follow-ups immediate and 3-month post-intervention. The primary outcome is improvements in HIV Prevention Continuum outcomes and the secondary outcomes are mental health and substance use. The project also seeks to gather qualitative data from one-arm pilot participants to identify strategies to overcome barriers to implementing rigorous randomized controlled trial research designs with trans women of color. Study findings will provide the necessary groundwork for a community-engaged efficacy trial in a subsequent, large-scale clinical trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transgender women of color experience trauma and violence, which contributes to HIV risk and inequities across the HIV Prevention Continuum.

"Efficacy of Couples-Based HIV Prevention in Vulnerable Young Men Project Summary Adolescent and young adult men who have sex with men (YMSM) are the only group in the U.S. in which rates of new HIV infections are increasing, which reflects a large disparity relative to heterosexuals. Steady or main partner relationships account for a substantial proportion of new HIV infections in YMSM. Among YMSM a serious relationship status is perhaps the strongest predictor of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), and pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be discontinued in a relationship. Romantic relationships also provide myriad benefits, including promotion of mental, behavioral, and physical health. Despite the critical importance of romantic relationship factors for HIV prevention, the vast majority of studies and interventions focus on individuals. We conducted formative research on coupled YMSM through an NIH R21 from which we developed an innovative couples-based intervention that addresses the continuum of HIV prevention and care for YMSM couples. The 2GETHER program integrates couples- and group-based modalities and is innovative in its design to address HIV transmission risk in couples regardless of serostatus; couples learn to utilize behavioral and biomedical approaches to prevent both HIV acquisition and transmission, with an overarching emphasis on improving relationship functioning. 2GETHER further encourages uptake of couples-based HIV testing for HIV-/unknown YMSM and medication adherence and engagement in care for HIV+ YMSM. We established feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of 2GETHER in a pilot trial of coupled YMSM (N=60 couples; 120 individuals), including significant decreases in HIV transmission risk behavior. Based on our highly successful pilot, we propose to test the efficacy of 2GETHER in large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will: (a) enroll racially diverse coupled YMSM; (b) randomize couples to either the 2GETHER intervention or attention-matched positive affect skills program for couples; (c) measure intervention outcomes through 12 months post-intervention. Analysis of study outcomes will utilize both individual- and dyadic-level data. Primary HIV risk behavioral outcome: an individual-level dichotomous variable indicating presence of CAI with a serodiscordant or unknown status partner. Exploratory analysis will calculate an innovative variable that accounts for the relative risk of sexual behaviors with partners of different serostatus, accounting for biomedical prevention. Primary biomedical outcome: Chlamydia/Gonnorhea incidence in individuals. Secondary dyadic-level HIV risk outcomes: concordance/discordance in relationship sexual agreement type and presence of agreement breaks. Secondary individual-level engagement in care outcomes: HIV testing uptake (HIV- men) and medication adherence (HIV+ men). In the context of increasing fatigue for HIV prevention, a healthy relationships program for coupled YMSM presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Further, in the era of treatment as prevention, we must develop transmission prevention strategies for MSM regardless of serostatus that address the full continuum of prevention and care. Project Narrative Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and infections are increasing most among young MSM (YMSM), but YMSM report increasing fatigue with HIV prevention messages and strategies. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among YMSM by establishing the efficacy of an innovative, healthy relationship program for coupled YMSM (regardless of HIV status) that aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies, as well as primary and secondary prevention approaches.",Efficacy of Couples-Based

"Social Capital and Late HIV Diagnosis in the United States Project Summary DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed Mentored Scientist Career Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate with competencies to become an independent NIH-funded researcher. The candidate’s long-term goal is to develop expertise in HIV prevention research and in community-level HIV prevention design, implementation, and evaluation. The proposed research in the K01 period is to investigate the role of community-level mechanisms linking social capital to late HIV diagnosis in the United States (US). Late HIV diagnosis remains a persistent public health threat in the US; it is associated with poorer survival among HIV+ persons, and drives onward HIV transmission in the community. The association among social capital, mediating mechanisms and HIV diagnosis remains under-investigated in the US. Aim 1: To characterize the longitudinal relationship between social capital and late HIV diagnosis across race/ethnicity. AIM 2: To investigate mechanisms (HIV testing and HIV stigma) in relation to the association between social capital and late HIV diagnosis across race/ethnicity. AIM 3: To develop and pilot social capital indicators, tailored to HIV prevention. The candidate will develop additional training through didactic coursework in 1) advanced quantitative and qualitative research methods including spatial econometrics, ethnography, and community based participatory research; 2) epidemiologic/clinical study design, and 3) intervention development. The candidate will be mentored by a team of internationally renowned experts in HIV prevention research, social determinants of health, causal inference, and HIV surveillance systems. Mentor and advisory committee members are from Harvard University, City University of New York, Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, Emory University, and University of Pennsylvania. Institutional resources available to the candidate include Harvard Center for AIDS Research and The Fenway Institute. Findings from the proposed research will provide the competencies and preliminary data for the candidate to write an R01 or R34 proposal to develop, implement, and evaluate a community-level social capital-based HIV prevention intervention. Project Narrative/ Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed research is to develop a deeper understanding on the role of social capital and late HIV diagnosis in the United States (US), and to better understand mechanisms that link the two. The project also aims to develop an indicator of social capital tailored to HIV prevention that is distinctly different from traditional indicators (e.g., social cohesion or collective efficacy). My research is significant because intervening at the stage of HIV diagnosis could have significant downstream impact on lowering community-level viral load suppression and reducing HIV incidence in key populations. Social capital is a modifiable determinant that can be generated and leveraged for community-level HIV prevention interventions in the US setting.",Social Capital and Late HIV Diagnosis in the United States,9893899,K01MH111374,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"University of Pittsburgh MACS/WIHS CCS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching strategy of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) clinical research site (CRS) together with our collaborative clinical site at The Ohio State University (OSU) of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Woman’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS CCS) is to support, complement and accelerate the CCS unified scientific agenda (USA) by leveraging the strengths and scientific expertise of CRS investigators. We propose to continue to expand on our 35 years of extensive research on the natural history of HIV infection. The central hypothesis of this grant application is that, as men and women with chronic HIV infection age, they increase their risks for serious, life-shortening comorbidities beyond those of comparable age, uninfected persons, and this could differ between men and women. As directed by NIH RFA- HL-19-008, the CRS will provide robust and inclusive leadership focused on five specific aims of the USA, and targeted collaborative support for the five other aims, to improve our understanding of the epidemiologic, clinical, virologic, immunologic, and behavioral relationships of HIV infection to chronic comorbidities in men and women that represent the current HIV epidemic in the United States. The CRS will also contribute longitudinal data and biological specimens for collaborative research projects on HIV led by CCS and non-CCS investigators. This research is important to fulfill our mission of improving clinical management, increasing survival and controlling, preventing and curing HIV infection. The CRS will provide the most current and innovative epidemiological, clinical and laboratory methods and psychosocial research protocols to accomplish our 5 leadership specific aims. The Pitt/OSU CRS will be led by a triumvirate of MPIs and several CoIs with broad expertise needed to lead five highly specialized CCS USA Specific Aims (Aim 2: Pulmonary/Sleep [Morris]; Aim 3: Neurocognitive [Becker]; Aim 6: HIV/Pathogenesis [Macatangay]; Aim 7: Psychosocial [Stall]; Aim 9: Platform [Rinaldo, Kingsley]) and to provide insight for the 5 other Specific Aims (Aim 1: Cardiovascular [Kingsley, Martinson], Aim 4: Aging [Koletar], Aim 5: Cancer [Jenkins], Aim 8: Health Disparities [Krier], Aim 10: Career Development [Sluis- Cremer]. With this plan the Pitt/OSU CRS addresses the basic justification of the FOA, i.e., that the impact of HIV, its treatment, and the legacy of immune suppression need to be more fully understood to optimize the health of people living with HIV. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scientific leadership and methods implemented by the Pitt/OSU CRS will enable the MACS/WIHS CCS to answer important questions relevant to treated HIV-infected MSM, the group with the highest HIV incidence in the US, and questions about the interaction of HIV and aging, important as the HIV-infected population shifts into older ages. The proposed research will provide information for development and administration of new interventions for HIV, as well as for the prevention of AIDS-defining and non-AIDS defining outcomes.",University of Pittsburgh MACS/WIHS CCS,9904786,U01HL146208,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', '

"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities ABSTRACT The Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) vision as detailed in our current Strategic Plan is “leading the creation and advancement of health equity”. To accomplish this vision, and ultimately health equity, new structures are required. More rapid translation of research discoveries has been facilitated through a “team-based approach” to address the health of the people and communities. This means bringing biomedical, clinical, and behavioral investigators and others together in Multidisciplinary Translational Teams (MDTT’s) focused on a health disparity that bring to bear their combined expertise to address populations health translating discoveries into practical solutions. MSM RCMI Program has been successful at developing research infrastructure including researchers. This application has been developed to bring the expertise of the RCMI Program Cores, with Community and Clinical researchers and partners to build Multidisciplinary Translational Teams across the T spectrum targeted at more rapid translation of health disparities (e.g., Cancer, Stroke, Infectious Diseases, Cardiometabolic Disease, Reproductive Health) by expanding the baseline research infrastructure established by Morehouse School of Medicine. The primary objectives are to build those teams through research projects targeted at health disparities, and to develop a pipeline of developing research teams at MSM, and to increase the level of involvement of investigators in conducting MDTT research at MSM. The U54 Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities (CTRHD) consists of five Cores (Administrative, Research Infrastructure, Investigation Development, Community Engagement, and Recruitment); Three Research Projects; an evaluation component attached to the Administrative Core, and a Pilot Project Program attached to the Investigator Development Core. With these assets and activities, the CTRHD will accomplish its goal through the following Aims: AIM 1: Transform Our Institution. Build processes and structures facilitating development of competitive multidisciplinary translational teams (MDTTs), allowing MSM to emerge as the preeminent, research-intensive, minority serving academic health center in the nation. AIM 2: Transform the MSM Research Environment. Develop collaborations allowing MSM faculty to do cutting edge translational health disparities research. AIM 3: Transform the Community of Scientists. Promote and accelerate training and mentoring capabilities at MSM, leading to the next generation of leaders in health disparities multidisciplinary translational research. AIM 4. Transform Our Community. Facilitate integration of Basic Research with Community Engagement.

"Structural Stigma and HIV Prevention Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. At current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Extant research has largely focused on identifying individual- and interpersonal-level risk factors for HIV infection among GBM; however, accumulating evidence also points to structural determinants of HIV outcomes in this population. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that structural stigma—defined as societal- level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the resources and opportunities of stigmatized individuals—is associated with adverse health outcomes, including HIV risk, among GBM. For example, pilot data from our research group showed that 4,098 GBM living in states with high levels of structural stigma—measured with a composite index of discriminatory state laws and negative social attitudes towards homosexuality—had lower levels of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge and use, lower odds of HIV testing, and greater odds of condomless anal sex compared with those living in low structural stigma states. While promising, the few existing studies of structural stigma and HIV outcomes among GBM have been limited by a reliance on cross-sectional designs, a small number of structural covariates, little attention to mediators/moderators of the structural stigma-HIV risk association, and non-probability samples of GBM. To address these limitations, we will create a new, prospective, nationally representative study of HIV-uninfected/unknown status GBM who will be followed for 5 waves of data collection over a 24-month period (N=500). With a representative sample of participants from across the U.S., we will have substantial variation in the social context surrounding GBM. This will be the first and largest prospective study with a nationally representative sample of GBM specifically designed to: (1) examine whether structural forms of stigma related to sexual identity increase vulnerability to adverse HIV prevention outcomes (e.g., less HIV testing and PEP/PrEP use); (2) identify mutable mechanisms (e.g., self-stigma, depressive symptoms, safer-sex self efficacy) through which structural stigma influences HIV outcomes; and (3) evaluate resilience processes (e.g., LGB community connectedness) that may mitigate the negative effects of structural stigma on HIV outcomes. In the final phase of the project, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 key informants and 30 GBM. We will use data from these interviews, together with the quantitative results, to inform the development of multi-level HIV intervention strategies that are maximally responsive to the structural conditions in which GBM are embedded. We have assembled a team of experts in structural stigma, HIV prevention among GBM, qualitative research, and survey research with nationally representative samples to address our study aims. This project stands to make important contributions to research on reducing disparities in the incidence of HIV infections among GBM, identified as a high NIH HIV/AIDS research priority. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the United States; further, recent estimates suggest that at current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Research into the underlying factors that can explain this risk—especially at the structural level, which has been relatively understudied—constitutes a critical area for public health. The goal of this proposed research is to evaluate structural determinants of HIV prevention outcomes among a nationally representative cohort of GBM, which will provide essential information that can be used to inform the development of effective HIV preventive strategies that address the social conditions surrounding the general population of GBM.",Structural Stigma and HIV Prevention Outcomes,10206432,R01MH112384,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Services ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' Safe Sex ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' secondary outcome ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' family support ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sexual identity ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' anal intercourse without condom ', ' anal sex without condom ', ' condomless anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal sex ', ' unsafe anal intercourse ', ' unsafe anal sex ', ' condomless anal sex ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,692703,0.04717313603330204
"Towards prevention of HIV among vulnerable and stigmatized populations using geospatial data HIV remains a global public health priority and occurs disproportionality among minority and stigmatized populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM). The occurrence of HIV is not random in the population, rather it exhibits patterns by individual and contextual factors. Is it the contextual factors, such as the neighborhood where one lives, socializes, or engages in sex, that is the focus of the proposed research. This proposed program of training and research examines the geospatial features of HIV using epidemiological data and analyses. The overarching goal is to improve the epidemiology of studying HIV by incorporating geospatial measures into HIV risk models through three areas. First, opportunities exist to tailor and refine existing HIV surveillance programs towards the most vulnerable groups using contextual determinants of risk. A second opportunity is to improve the validity of geospatial analyses through more accurate measurement and correct quantification of the spatial unit. A final opportunity is to improve risk quantification and reduce biased inference by applying spatial features of disease distribution to studying HIV risk. Taken together, attention to these three insights can improve HIV surveillance and epidemiology to guide prevention services. This project utilizes Philadelphia Department of Public Health’s AIDS Activities Coordinating Office surveillance data of people living with HIV/AIDS in Philadelphia in conjunction with data obtained via systematic review. Research questions to be answered include the optimal placement of HIV screening services in Philadelphia, the most appropriate choice of contextual unit to analyze spatial data (e.g., neighborhood, ZIP code, census tract), and the impact of sexual networks based upon geographic location of partner selection. Analyses will include advanced geospatial methods, hierarchical regression modeling, and agent-based simulation models. Follow-up work will include joint systems dynamic and agent-based models with a focus on health disparities in HIV. The proposed research will be complemented by experiential and didactic training in (1) geographic information systems and spatial analysis of epidemiologic data, (2) systems science and health disparities, and (3) epidemiological surveillance systems with a focus on HIV surveillance. This research and training will enable a program of independent research on the contextual factors relating neighborhood and HIV transmission and infection among vulnerable and stigmatized populations. HIV risk estimation models can be improved by utilizing geospatial data to fully capture the heterogeneous distribution of cases and risk factors, particularly among groups who may be stigmatized. This project will use Philadelphia specific surveillance data to model community- and individual-level factors relating to HIV transmission and infection among vulnerable populations. The overarching goal is to improve the quality of HIV epidemiologic research by incorporating geospatial data in surveillance to minimize bias and to guide HIV prevention services.",Towards prevention of HIV among vulnerable and stigmatized populations using geospatial data,10006327,K01AI143356,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Monitoring ', ' Epidemiologic surveillance ', ' Epidemiological Monitoring ', ' Epidemiological surveillance ', ' Epidemiology Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Socialization ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Training Programs ', ' Viremia ', ' viraemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' virusemia ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' heuristics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Minority ', ' Guide prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Network-based ', ' public health priorities ', ' surveillance data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' screening ', ' sexually transmitted HIV ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIAID,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,118767,0.0004945419219242666
