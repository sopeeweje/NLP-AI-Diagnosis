"MI SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN: DISPARITIES IN WOMEN OF COLOR   DESCRIPTION: Despite decades of research to prevent and treat cardiovascular         disease, each year it continues to kill more than half a million women, a            greater number than the subsequent 16 causes of death combined. Black women          have age-adjusted death rates from coronary heart disease (CHD) over 71 percent      higher than that of white women, and CHD is the leading cause of death in            Hispanic women. Further, Black and Hispanic women have increased numbers of          cardiac risk factors and comorbidities. However, few studies have specifically       focused on women's of myocardial infarction (MI) and CHD or addressed their          prodromal symptoms. Even less is known about MI symptoms in women of color.          This lack of an accurate description of symptoms means that women often do not       recognize their symptoms and thus delay seeking treatment, which is associated       with less effective and fewer treatment options, longer hospitalizations, and        higher mortality and morbidity rates. Since Black and Hispanic women delay           seeking treatment longer than other groups, perhaps because their symptoms do        not match their expectations, researchers must delineate their symptomatology.       A more accurate description of symptoms of MI in women of color should help          them recognize their symptoms better and seek treatment earlier. Therefore,          this study proposes to describe prodromal and acute symptoms of MI in Black and      Hispanic women using a telephone survey of 1030 women from 10 medical centers.       We will query women of color 4-6 months after their MI about their prodromal         and acute symptoms and cardiovascular risk status. We will compare the symptoms      of women of color with those of white women being investigated in our currently      funded R01. We will analyze differences among the ethnic groups while                controlling for factors that may be unique in the groups, such as                    cardiovascular risk status and location of MI. Results of this study will help       us more fully describe and recognize prodromal and acute symptomatology in           women of color with CHD and MI.

"Mental Health Consequences of Violent Victimization  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed research plan requests 4 years of funding to broaden and extend the scope of an ongoing NIMH-funded prospective study designed to examine the mental health consequences of exposure to community violence in young adults. Six hundred adult physical trauma survivors will be recruited from three large Level I urban trauma centers serving the most populous, and ethnically diverse, county in the United States. Participants will represent three different ethnic groups: Latino-Americans (N = 200), African-Americans (N = 200), and non-Latino Caucasians (N 200). Following our ongoing protocol, all participants will complete three lay-administered face-to-face assessment interviews, conducted over a 12-month period: within days of hospitalization, at 3-months and 12-months after initial interview. Each participant will also complete a telephone interview conducted by a trained clinician at 2-months after initial interview.    The broad aims of the proposed research are: 1). To characterize and compare the post-trauma adjustment of ethnic minority (i.e., Black, Latino), and non-minority (i.e., non-Latino Caucasian) adults with respect to symptoms of acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health-related functional status, after adjusting for mechanism and severity of injury. Attention will also be directed at characterizing cross-group gender differences with respect to post-trauma adjustment outcomes. 2). To describe the contribution of pre- and post-trauma resilience and vulnerability factors that influence post-trauma adjustment outcomes, with special emphasis on mechanisms that explain differences that may emerge across ethnic groups and gender. 3). To identify unmet need for services and barriers to care, with a particular emphasis on determining whether unmet needs and barriers to care vary as a function of ethnic minority status or gender. Special attention will be devoted to identifying mechanisms that may underlie any apparent ethnic- or gender-based service utilization disparities.

"Race, Psychiatric Disorders, and Headache DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests five years of support for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for a new minority investigator. The objectives of the planned training program are two-fold. The first objective is to provide the minority candidate with contemporary training in the areas of statistics, research methodology, research ethics, the pathophysiology of headache disorders, cross-cultural psychology, and health disparities. Formal coursework in these areas will facilitate the successful conduct of the planned study and prepare the candidate for future research endeavors throughout her career. The second objective is to examine how race and psychiatric co-morbid conditions are related to headache severity, quality of life, treatment adherence, and ability to respond favorably to treatments in people with episodic migraines, chronic migraines, episodic tension-type headaches, chronic tension-type headaches, substance abuse headaches, or cluster headaches. Using a quasi-experimental prospective research design, 400 patients presenting at outpatient medical centers in four urban areas of Ohio (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Toledo) will complete self-administered assessments, telephone-based interviews, and daily headache diaries that elicit data on headache severity, quality of life, social support, treatment self-efficacy, locus of control, treatment adherence, and treatment outcome. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; Bandura, 1986), the planned study will employ structural equation modeling path analysis to determine whether SCT constructs, such as social support, health-related locus of control, and treatment self-efficacy, mediate associations between race and the presence of a co-morbid psychiatric disorder and key outcome measures, such as quality of life and treatment outcome. If successful, the candidate will obtain extramural funding prior to the completion of the training program that will enable her to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate a culturally-contextualized intervention to reduce headache pain and improve the life quality of people who experience severe headache characteristics.

"The Manahattan HIV Brain Bank    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The Manhattan HIV Brain Bank, a member of the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium, is a resource for the provision of well-characterized tissues and fluids from HIV-infected patients to NeuroAIDS investigators.  In the previous funding period, infrastructure to facilitate the collection and distribution of tissues, fluids and information was built.

"Gender & Symptom Differences in Acute Coronary Syndromes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Heart disease is the foremost public health issue in the United States for both women and men. Diabetes and obesity, twin epidemics and major risk factors for heart disease, have increased 61% and 74% respectively in only 10 years. Furthermore, in every year since 1984, more women than men have died from cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if there are gender and/or symptom differences in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and to determine if differences persist after controlling for age, diabetes mellitus, functional status, and mood. ACS includes three clinical diagnoses: unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI), and ST-elevation MI. Gender similarities and differences will be identified in each diagnostic group as well as for ACS as a whole.  In addition, comparison of symptoms will be made between the three diagnostic groups. Specific aims include: (1) to identify the type, severity, location, and quality of the symptoms of ACS for women and men admitted to the hospital; (2) to assess functional status in the week prior to hospitalization: (3) to examine levels of anxiety and depression prior to hospitalization; and (4) to describe risk factors, health history, and socio-demographic differences between women and men. This descriptive, comparative study will include a non-probability sample of approximately 110 women and 110 men, hospitalized with ACS. Four metropolitan midwestern sites will be sampled in order to increase the likelihood of enrolling a heterogeneous sample encompassing a broad array of racial and ethnic groups, income levels, and cultures. At least one third of the sample will come from minority groups. Subjects will be interviewed in their hospital room a minimum of 12 hours after admission. The Symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndromes Inventory, The Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification of angina tool, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be used to collect data. Results of this study will provide a basis for; (1) development of gender- based models of symptoms for ACS that can be disseminated to the public, those with established coronary heart disease (CHD), and to practitioners who evaluate patients with possible ACS; (2) development and testing of a Symptoms of ACS assessment tool that can be used by paramedics and triage nurses; and (3) development and testing interventions that will inform women of their vulnerability to CHD.         ",Gender & Symptom Differences in Acute Coronary Syndromes,7148588,R15NR008870,"['diabetes mellitus ', ' syndrome ', ' medical record ', ' angina pectoris ', ' myocardial infarction ', ' heart disorder diagnosis ', ' hospital utilization ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' behavior test ', ' anxiety ', ' mood disorder ', ' gender difference ', ' socioenvironment ', ' functional ability ', ' age difference ', ' clinical research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NINR,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO,R15,2004,73676,0.04125512828328414
"Occupational Skin Disease Among Minority Farmworkers    DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) Everyone who works in agriculture is exposed to numerous environmental risk factors (weather, mechanical devices, chemicals, animals, wild plants, organic and inorganic dust, fungi) that can result in occupational injury and illness. Occupational skin disease (OSD) is a widely acknowledged, but poorly documented, occupational illness among all agricultural workers. Environmental risks are especially great for migrant and seasonal farm-workers. Most farm-workers are Latino immigrants, with the vast majority being from Mexico. Due to their lack of workplace control and limited treatment options, OSD among farm-workers must be examined in a health disparities and environmental justice framework. This study will employ in-depth interviews, surveillance, and a clinic-based study to:  1) delineate farm-worker interpretations of OSD symptomatology, etiology, self-care behaviors, and barriers to prevention and treatment seeking; 2) estimate the prevalence of OSD across the work season; 3) determine the risk factors for (a) the presence and severity of OSD symptoms, including work activities and exposures, environmental factors, farm-worker biological and personal characteristics, preventive behaviors, and treatment behaviors, and (b) skin-related quality of life; and 4) determine the predictors of OSD severity and specific diagnoses among farm-workers who present to migrant health clinics. Guided by a biopsychosocial model that acknowledges the multiple factors that determine the presence and severity of skin symptoms, and the impact of symptom severity on quality of life, this project will produce the first prospective data on occupational skin disease and its risk factors among migrant and seasonal farm-workers. The results of this project will be used in subsequent projects to address our long-term goal of reducing environmental risk for OSD among all agricultural workers. The project will be completed in an area of eastern North Carolina in which a large number of farm-workers are employed. There are 3 research components for this 4- year project. First, in-depth interviews will be used to elicit farm-workers' Explanatory Models for OSD. Second, a prospective surveillance study will follow 225 farmworker at 8 points during an agricultural season to delineate farm-worker perceptions of OSD symptoms, dermatological quality of life, and OSD risk factors. Finally, a clinic study will use telemedicine procedures to diagnosis OSD among 150 farm-workers who present at migrant clinics and delineate the risks associated with these diagnoses.         ",Occupational Skin Disease Among Minority Farmworkers,6720529,R01ES012358,"['telemedicine ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' sign /symptom ', ' environmental health ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' self care ', ' community health service ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' occupational disease /disorder ', ' agriculture worker ', ' epidemiology ', ' health behavior ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' perception ', ' skin disorder ', ' skin disorder diagnosis ', ' Hispanic American ', ' Mexican American ', ' migrant ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' disease /disorder etiology ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' rural health ', ' ']",NIEHS,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,406325,0.04035971845444958
"Patterns of PTSD Symptoms in High-Risk Women Over Time DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low-income and minority women constitute an especially high-risk group for intimate partner violence (IPV) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nevertheless, little research exists documenting the structure and course of PTSD symptoms following IPV among these women. Also, research is needed to identify mechanisms by which specific PTSD symptoms might predict factors associated with poor recovery in this population. Four hundred and six survivors of recent IPV completed measures of violence exposure and PTSD every three months for one year. Confirmatory factor analysis will be conducted to verify the symptom structure of PTSD in this sample and test competing models of PTSD in the field. Cross-lagged panel analysis and other longitudinal methods will be employed to examine the causal interrelations of separate PTSD symptoms over time. In addition, the impact of distinct PTSD symptoms on revictimization over one year will be examined prospectively. Finally, exploratory analyses will investigate associations between separate PTSD symptoms at baseline and group psychotherapy process and outcomes in a small sample of low-income minority women exposed to interpersonal violence.

"Symptom Relief and Social Support in Parent Training DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad goal of this project is to better understand mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of behavioral parent-training interventions aimed at child externalizing behavior. More specifically, the present set of studies seeks to accomplish three goals by experimentally manipulating certain parameters of a parent training intervention: First, they attempt to elucidate the role that parental social support plays in the retention, outcome, and maintenance of families who receive parent-training. Second, they seek to examine whether altering the sequence of parent-training topics produces more rapid symptom relief in dysfunctional parenting and whether such immediate improvements reduce parent drop-out and improve outcomes. Third, they seek to examine how gains made in parenting skill and child behavior are maintained after the initial parent-training intervention has ended.  Correlational data suggest that rapid symptom relief and robust social support improve the outcomes seen with parent-training interventions. However, there is little experimental evidence to support the contention that these two variables have such effects. It is hypothesized that initial symptom relief and robust social support significantly contribute to retaining parents in treatment and increasing the probability that parents will experience improvements in parenting, and in turn, children will experience corresponding improvement in externalizing behavior. It is further hypothesized that increased post-intervention parent therapist contact will significantly improve the maintenance of gains seen immediately post treatment. This experiment employs random assignment of 120 parent-child dyads seeking treatment for the child's externalizing behavior, to test and examine theory about the role of initial symptom reduction, parental social support, and post-intervention therapist-parent contact on parent-training outcomes.  Convincing support for these two relationships could significantly alter the way that parent-training interventions are implemented, leading to increases in the percentages of families who benefit from such interventions.

"Center for Reducing Risks in Vulnerable Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall purpose of the Center for Reducing Risks in Vulnerable Populations (CRRVP) is to (a) advance the science of bio-behavioral health for vulnerable populations, emphasizing issues associated with vulnerability related age (very young and elderly),   minority status, and lower socioeconomic status; (b) reduce disparities in disease/illness; and (c) support research training by providing core services and resources to investigators. The work of the CRRVP will be accomplished through three research cores (a) Multi-ethnic Emphasis Core, (b) Bio-behavioral Methods Core and (c) Development and Dissemination Core. The CRRVP will sponsor research to advance the science in bio-behavioral health for vulnerable populations and in the year four novice investigators will be funded to conduct pilot studies. The science of the CRRVP is organized by a bio-behavioral and health-related quality of life framework. Key elements in this framework include person (individual) factors, environmental factors, physiological and psychological variables, symptom status, functional status, general health perception, and quality of life. Studies supported by the CRRVP will (a) reduce disparity and promote healthy life styles for vulnerable populations, (b) elucidate underlying physiological and psychological mechanisms that contribute to symptoms, functional status, perceived health status and quality of life, (c) test interventions to minimize symptoms, enhance functional status, perceived health status and quality of life. The research supported by the CRRVP will have a strong bio-behavioral orientation with an emphasis on potential/real health problems experienced by people who are very young, elderly, minorities and/or lower socioeconomic status. In addition, the CRRVP will have a strong emphasis on facilitating multi-ethnic research and reducing disparity in health through research. The combining of research related to vulnerable populations under the umbrella of a single center is a strength to overlaps in the science that have not been explored.

"Race, Psychiatric Disorders, and Headache DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests five years of support for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for a new minority investigator. The objectives of the planned training program are two-fold. The first objective is to provide the minority candidate with contemporary training in the areas of statistics, research methodology, research ethics, the pathophysiology of headache disorders, cross-cultural psychology, and health disparities. Formal coursework in these areas will facilitate the successful conduct of the planned study and prepare the candidate for future research endeavors throughout her career. The second objective is to examine how race and psychiatric co-morbid conditions are related to headache severity, quality of life, treatment adherence, and ability to respond favorably to treatments in people with episodic migraines, chronic migraines, episodic tension-type headaches, chronic tension-type headaches, substance abuse headaches, or cluster headaches. Using a quasi-experimental prospective research design, 400 patients presenting at outpatient medical centers in four urban areas of Ohio (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Toledo) will complete self-administered assessments, telephone-based interviews, and daily headache diaries that elicit data on headache severity, quality of life, social support, treatment self-efficacy, locus of control, treatment adherence, and treatment outcome. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; Bandura, 1986), the planned study will employ structural equation modeling path analysis to determine whether SCT constructs, such as social support, health-related locus of control, and treatment self-efficacy, mediate associations between race and the presence of a co-morbid psychiatric disorder and key outcome measures, such as quality of life and treatment outcome. If successful, the candidate will obtain extramural funding prior to the completion of the training program that will enable her to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate a culturally-contextualized intervention to reduce headache pain and improve the life quality of people who experience severe headache characteristics.

"SSRI-INDUCED CHANGES IN CORTICAL GABA IN WOMEN WITH PMDD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a distinct disorder that effects at least 3% of menstruating women, is associated with significant functional impairment. That PMDD is preferentially responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment provides strong evidence that serotonergic dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology, as well as, treatment of PMDD. However, there are substantial clinical and preclinical data to implicate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system as a mediator of the clinical efficacy of SSRIs in this disorder. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (IH-MRS), our group has found that women with PMDD have abnormal central GABAergic regulation in response to menstrual cycle-related fluctuations in neuroactive steroids. Cortical GABA concentrations fluctuate across the menstrual cycle in a diagnosis- and phase-specific fashion with the greatest disparity in cortical GABA levels during the follicular phase, when women with PMDD had significantly lower cortical GABA levels than healthy menstruating controls. Presently, it is unclear whether inhibition of serotonin reuptake or alternatively SSRI modulation of GABAergic function is crucial in the therapeutic action of SSRIs in the treatment of PMDD. In support of the latter, animal and human studies have shown that SSRI administration enhances central production of the potent GABAA receptor agonist, allopregnanolone (ALLO). At baseline, women with PMDD fail to demonstrate a normal GABAergic response to endogenous or exogenous exposure to ALLO. Further, we have found that successful SSRI treatment is associated with an increase in occipital cortical GABA levels during the follicular phase in women with PMDD, essentially ""righting"" the abnormal cyclic changes in GABA seen in these women prior to treatment. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is two-fold; to confirm these early 1H-MRS findings in a group of women undergoing fluoxetine treatment for PMDD and to determine the impact of fluoxetine treatment on the relationship between occipital cortex GABA levels and plasma ALLO levels across the menstrual cycle. We anticipate that our findings will provide further support for the role of GABA and neurosteroids in the pathogenesis and treatment of PMDD.

"Mental Health Consequences of Violent Victimization  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed research plan requests 4 years of funding to broaden and extend the scope of an ongoing NIMH-funded prospective study designed to examine the mental health consequences of exposure to community violence in young adults. Six hundred adult physical trauma survivors will be recruited from three large Level I urban trauma centers serving the most populous, and ethnically diverse, county in the United States. Participants will represent three different ethnic groups: Latino-Americans (N = 200), African-Americans (N = 200), and non-Latino Caucasians (N 200). Following our ongoing protocol, all participants will complete three lay-administered face-to-face assessment interviews, conducted over a 12-month period: within days of hospitalization, at 3-months and 12-months after initial interview. Each participant will also complete a telephone interview conducted by a trained clinician at 2-months after initial interview.    The broad aims of the proposed research are: 1). To characterize and compare the post-trauma adjustment of ethnic minority (i.e., Black, Latino), and non-minority (i.e., non-Latino Caucasian) adults with respect to symptoms of acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health-related functional status, after adjusting for mechanism and severity of injury. Attention will also be directed at characterizing cross-group gender differences with respect to post-trauma adjustment outcomes. 2). To describe the contribution of pre- and post-trauma resilience and vulnerability factors that influence post-trauma adjustment outcomes, with special emphasis on mechanisms that explain differences that may emerge across ethnic groups and gender. 3). To identify unmet need for services and barriers to care, with a particular emphasis on determining whether unmet needs and barriers to care vary as a function of ethnic minority status or gender. Special attention will be devoted to identifying mechanisms that may underlie any apparent ethnic- or gender-based service utilization disparities.

"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative RO1 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to increased antipsychotic use in African-Americans. The final objective is to determine whether Latinos are at risk for similar problems in diagnostic assessments and treatment assignment.

Nevertheless, little research exists documenting the structure and course of PTSD symptoms following IPV among these women. Also, research is needed to identify mechanisms by which specific PTSD symptoms might predict factors associated with poor recovery in this population. Four hundred and six survivors of recent IPV completed measures of violence exposure and PTSD every three months for one year. Confirmatory factor analysis will be conducted to verify the symptom structure of PTSD in this sample and test competing models of PTSD in the field. Cross-lagged panel analysis and other longitudinal methods will be employed to examine the causal interrelations of separate PTSD symptoms over time. In addition, the impact of distinct PTSD symptoms on revictimization over one year will be examined prospectively. Finally, exploratory analyses will investigate associations between separate PTSD symptoms at baseline and group psychotherapy process and outcomes in a small sample of low-income minority women exposed to interpersonal violence.

"Symptom Relief and Social Support in Parent Training DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad goal of this project is to better understand mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of behavioral parent-training interventions aimed at child externalizing behavior. More specifically, the present set of studies seeks to accomplish three goals by experimentally manipulating certain parameters of a parent training intervention: First, they attempt to elucidate the role that parental social support plays in the retention, outcome, and maintenance of families who receive parent-training. Second, they seek to examine whether altering the sequence of parent-training topics produces more rapid symptom relief in dysfunctional parenting and whether such immediate improvements reduce parent drop-out and improve outcomes. Third, they seek to examine how gains made in parenting skill and child behavior are maintained after the initial parent-training intervention has ended.  Correlational data suggest that rapid symptom relief and robust social support improve the outcomes seen with parent-training interventions. However, there is little experimental evidence to support the contention that these two variables have such effects. It is hypothesized that initial symptom relief and robust social support significantly contribute to retaining parents in treatment and increasing the probability that parents will experience improvements in parenting, and in turn, children will experience corresponding improvement in externalizing behavior. It is further hypothesized that increased post-intervention parent therapist contact will significantly improve the maintenance of gains seen immediately post treatment. This experiment employs random assignment of 120 parent-child dyads seeking treatment for the child's externalizing behavior, to test and examine theory about the role of initial symptom reduction, parental social support, and post-intervention therapist-parent contact on parent-training outcomes.  Convincing support for these two relationships could significantly alter the way that parent-training interventions are implemented, leading to increases in the percentages of families who benefit from such interventions.

"Mental Health Consequences of Violent Victimization  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed research plan requests 4 years of funding to broaden and extend the scope of an ongoing NIMH-funded prospective study designed to examine the mental health consequences of exposure to community violence in young adults. Six hundred adult physical trauma survivors will be recruited from three large Level I urban trauma centers serving the most populous, and ethnically diverse, county in the United States. Participants will represent three different ethnic groups: Latino-Americans (N = 200), African-Americans (N = 200), and non-Latino Caucasians (N 200). Following our ongoing protocol, all participants will complete three lay-administered face-to-face assessment interviews, conducted over a 12-month period: within days of hospitalization, at 3-months and 12-months after initial interview. Each participant will also complete a telephone interview conducted by a trained clinician at 2-months after initial interview.    The broad aims of the proposed research are: 1). To characterize and compare the post-trauma adjustment of ethnic minority (i.e., Black, Latino), and non-minority (i.e., non-Latino Caucasian) adults with respect to symptoms of acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health-related functional status, after adjusting for mechanism and severity of injury. Attention will also be directed at characterizing cross-group gender differences with respect to post-trauma adjustment outcomes. 2). To describe the contribution of pre- and post-trauma resilience and vulnerability factors that influence post-trauma adjustment outcomes, with special emphasis on mechanisms that explain differences that may emerge across ethnic groups and gender. 3). To identify unmet need for services and barriers to care, with a particular emphasis on determining whether unmet needs and barriers to care vary as a function of ethnic minority status or gender. Special attention will be devoted to identifying mechanisms that may underlie any apparent ethnic- or gender-based service utilization disparities.

"Barriers to Seeking and Substaining Cardiovascular Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Delaying the decision to seek emergency medical treatment for the symptoms of an acute ischemic event (i.e., acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina) can mean the difference between life and death. Research has shown that women, African Americans, and older persons tend to delay seeking treatment for the symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) longer than middle-aged white men. Delays can lead to the destruction of heart muscle and may lead to poorer recovery, greater disability, and premature death. The purpose of this pilot study is to examine barriers to seeking prompt emergency care for acute ischemic symptoms and to see how these barriers impede sustained cardiovascular care over 6 month period after an acute event. This study will focus on an urban, predominantly older African American population who are admitted for the symptoms for AMI or unstable angina. Participants will be referred by hospital staff and will be interviewed within 5 days of hospitalization for the acute event. Follow-up interviews will take place 3- months and 6-months post-event. Baseline interviews will include questions pertaining to psychosocial factors, perceived and practical barriers to medical care, acute cardiac symptoms, medical comorbidity, knowledge of the warning signs of a heart attack and of personal cardiovascular risk factors, depressive symptomatology, and health cognitions and somatic complaints associated with cardiovascular disease. Follow-up interviews will focus on barriers that impede sustained cardiac care (i.e., treatment and medication compliance, lifestyle changes, and improved well-being). Many patients who experience symptoms of acute ischemia die before they reach the hospital or expire in the emergency room. In an effort to understand the barriers to delay in all acute ischemia patients, a retrospective proxy interview will be conducted among next of kin based on the in-hospital patient interview. The results of this study could play a key role in disentangling cardiovascular disparities among women and African Americans, and lead to the development of an intervention that would focus on lowering practical and perceived barriers to emergency cardiac care and recovery.         ",Barriers to Seeking and Substaining Cardiovascular Care,6985721,R03AG023230,"['human old age (65+) ', ' acute disease /disorder ', ' cardiovascular disorder education ', ' caregiver ', ' emergency care ', ' health care service utilization ', ' angina pectoris ', ' myocardial infarction ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human morbidity ', ' health behavior ', ' depression ', ' female ', ' African American ', ' therapy compliance ', ' quality of life ', "" women's health "", ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R03,2005,76500,0.03990439382147545
"A Multiethnic Internet Study on Menopausal Symptoms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing ethnic diversity of the U.S. population requires health professionals to practice with greater cultural competence in areas such as the management of menopausal symptoms, where cultural beliefs mediate the biology of reproduction and aging. A growing number of studies have challenged the universality of menopausal symptoms by indicating significant ethnic differences in how women experience them. However, few investigators have studied ethnic populations in the U.S., and few studies have been national in scope. With advances in computer technologies, the Internet now provides an excellent medium of national and international communication and allows people in different geographical areas to communicate and exchange their experiences and opinions. The proposed study uses innovative Internet data collection methods to collect national data and essential information about specific ethnic differences in menopausal symptom experience while respecting women's own experiences. The specific aims are to: a) explore ethnic differences in menopausal symptom experience reported by 4 of the most common ethnic groups of women across the U.S. (Hispanic, non-Hispanic (N-H) White, N-H African American, and N-H Asian); and b) explore the ethnic-specific contexts of women's daily lives that influence women's self-reported menopausal symptom experience. A feminist approach will guide the research process. Innovative data collection methods will be used, including an Internet survey among 500 middle-aged women recruited using the quota sampling method with multiple recruitment strategies through various Internet settings, and online forums of 6-month duration among 4 different ethnic groups (30 members per group) recruited from among the Internet survey participants. Long-term goals are to: a) contribute to recognition of women's own menopausal symptom experience so that health care can be planned and provided from women's own views and perspectives; b) develop decision support systems for menopausal symptom management that can be validated across diverse practice settings; and c) eliminate ethnic biases and inequity in menopausal symptom management and promote culturally competent care for menopausal women.

"Ethnicity and the diagnosis of affective illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative R01 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to iricreased antipsychotic use in African-Americans.

"Effects of Cancer Symptoms on Minority Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career goal of Dr. Guadalupe Palos is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral science, with a focus on underserved and minority populations.  The candidate's career plan offers an excellent opportunity to combine her previous training in oncology nursing and community social work with her academic preparation in health service research and behavioral science.  The revised research plan has been greatly simplified and is designed to build upon an NIH-funded longitudinal study of symptoms in patients with advanced lung cancer (Principal Investigator, CS Cleeland, PhD).  The study includes underserved minority and non-minority patients who will receive treatment in an inner city county hospital.  This is an excellent opportunity to study the caregivers of ethnic minorities, who, because of their socioeconomic status, may be highly stressed or overwhelmed compared to other caregivers of cancer patients.       This application integrates mentoring, training, and focused research to meet 3 objectives: a) to become an established investigator in the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches in cancer control and behavioral science; 2) to use these multi-methods approaches to study the problems of caregivers and the patients they care for; and 3) to evaluate the effects of sociocultural factors on the caregiver's experience. Dr. Palos' exceptional mentor team consists of Charles S. Cleeland, PhD, Richard Payne, MD., Marjorie Kagawa-Singer, PhD, and Amalie Ramirez, PhD.  Dr. Cleeland will provide mentorship in research related to measurement of symptoms.  Dr. Payne, world-renown for his work in disparities and pain management will provide mentorship in these areas.  Dr. Singer will be a mentor in the conceptualization and measurement of culture and ethnicity.  Dr. Ramirez will mentor the candidate in developing culturally competent cancer communication for future caregiver interventions.  Formal agreements and specific roles of the mentoring team have been documented and included.  The research training will take place at MD Anderson Cancer Center/Lyndon Baines Hospital, and to a lesser extent at University of California (Dr. Kagawa-Singer), Hispanic Center of Excellence - San Antonio (Dr. Amelie G. Ramirez), and Duke University -Durham, NC (Dr. Payne).       Research examining the negative outcomes in underserved minority caregivers, such as depression, stress, anxiety, pain, fatigue, or sleep disturbances, would help advance our understanding of these problems.  This project has a longitudinal, descriptive design to evaluate these areas.  The specific aims will be to (1) describe the meaning of the experience of being a minority (African-American or Latino) and non-minority person caring for a patient with advanced lung cancer; (2) describe and compare the experiences of minority and non-minority caregivers including the prevalence and severity of physical/psychological symptoms and their influence on caregiver symptom burden; and (3) assess the relationship between caregiver's symptoms (physical and psychological) and patient's symptom's at multiple time points over the course of the patient's treatment.

"Hormones/Genes in Women's Health: From Bench to Bedside DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of this BIRCWH proposal is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders, and those disorders specific to women. This application seeks support to create an integrated interdisciplinary training program that will be based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program will be modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption in this BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) will be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. This BIRCWH program will capitalize on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Scholars will be assigned a team of Mentors. In order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner, each of four Scholars will be assigned a Primary and Secondary Mentor. Primary Mentors will be in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors will be in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and will help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. A Career Mentor (senior HMS/HSPH faculty and senior administrators) will advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Finally there will be a Mentor in Health Disparities, who will expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity can be influenced by social/environmental factors. This BIRCWH proposal will focus on the following disorders, given both the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health. They include: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that this BIRCWH proposal is offering an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that will train the next generation of leaders in women's health.

Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative R01 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to increased antipsychotic use in African-Americans.

"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities.

"Occupational Skin Disease Among Minority Farmworkers    DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) Everyone who works in agriculture is exposed to numerous environmental risk factors (weather, mechanical devices, chemicals, animals, wild plants, organic and inorganic dust, fungi) that can result in occupational injury and illness. Occupational skin disease (OSD) is a widely acknowledged, but poorly documented, occupational illness among all agricultural workers. Environmental risks are especially great for migrant and seasonal farm-workers. Most farm-workers are Latino immigrants, with the vast majority being from Mexico. Due to their lack of workplace control and limited treatment options, OSD among farm-workers must be examined in a health disparities and environmental justice framework. This study will employ in-depth interviews, surveillance, and a clinic-based study to:  1) delineate farm-worker interpretations of OSD symptomatology, etiology, self-care behaviors, and barriers to prevention and treatment seeking; 2) estimate the prevalence of OSD across the work season; 3) determine the risk factors for (a) the presence and severity of OSD symptoms, including work activities and exposures, environmental factors, farm-worker biological and personal characteristics, preventive behaviors, and treatment behaviors, and (b) skin-related quality of life; and 4) determine the predictors of OSD severity and specific diagnoses among farm-workers who present to migrant health clinics. Guided by a biopsychosocial model that acknowledges the multiple factors that determine the presence and severity of skin symptoms, and the impact of symptom severity on quality of life, this project will produce the first prospective data on occupational skin disease and its risk factors among migrant and seasonal farm-workers. The results of this project will be used in subsequent projects to address our long-term goal of reducing environmental risk for OSD among all agricultural workers. The project will be completed in an area of eastern North Carolina in which a large number of farm-workers are employed. There are 3 research components for this 4- year project. First, in-depth interviews will be used to elicit farm-workers' Explanatory Models for OSD. Second, a prospective surveillance study will follow 225 farmworker at 8 points during an agricultural season to delineate farm-worker perceptions of OSD symptoms, dermatological quality of life, and OSD risk factors. Finally, a clinic study will use telemedicine procedures to diagnosis OSD among 150 farm-workers who present at migrant clinics and delineate the risks associated with these diagnoses.         ",Occupational Skin Disease Among Minority Farmworkers,6865633,R01ES012358,"['telemedicine ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' sign /symptom ', ' environmental health ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' self care ', ' community health service ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' occupational disease /disorder ', ' agriculture worker ', ' epidemiology ', ' health behavior ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' perception ', ' skin disorder ', ' skin disorder diagnosis ', ' Hispanic American ', ' Mexican American ', ' migrant ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' disease /disorder etiology ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' rural health ', ' ']",NIEHS,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,484719,0.04035971845444958

"SSRI-INDUCED CHANGES IN CORTICAL GABA IN WOMEN WITH PMDD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a distinct disorder that effects at least 3% of menstruating women, is associated with significant functional impairment. That PMDD is preferentially responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment provides strong evidence that serotonergic dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology, as well as, treatment of PMDD. However, there are substantial clinical and preclinical data to implicate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system as a mediator of the clinical efficacy of SSRIs in this disorder. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (IH-MRS), our group has found that women with PMDD have abnormal central GABAergic regulation in response to menstrual cycle-related fluctuations in neuroactive steroids. Cortical GABA concentrations fluctuate across the menstrual cycle in a diagnosis- and phase-specific fashion with the greatest disparity in cortical GABA levels during the follicular phase, when women with PMDD had significantly lower cortical GABA levels than healthy menstruating controls. Presently, it is unclear whether inhibition of serotonin reuptake or alternatively SSRI modulation of GABAergic function is crucial in the therapeutic action of SSRIs in the treatment of PMDD. In support of the latter, animal and human studies have shown that SSRI administration enhances central production of the potent GABAA receptor agonist, allopregnanolone (ALLO). At baseline, women with PMDD fail to demonstrate a normal GABAergic response to endogenous or exogenous exposure to ALLO. Further, we have found that successful SSRI treatment is associated with an increase in occipital cortical GABA levels during the follicular phase in women with PMDD, essentially ""righting"" the abnormal cyclic changes in GABA seen in these women prior to treatment. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is two-fold; to confirm these early 1H-MRS findings in a group of women undergoing fluoxetine treatment for PMDD and to determine the impact of fluoxetine treatment on the relationship between occipital cortex GABA levels and plasma ALLO levels across the menstrual cycle. We anticipate that our findings will provide further support for the role of GABA and neurosteroids in the pathogenesis and treatment of PMDD.

"Race, Psychiatric Disorders, and Headache DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests five years of support for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for a new minority investigator. The objectives of the planned training program are two-fold. The first objective is to provide the minority candidate with contemporary training in the areas of statistics, research methodology, research ethics, the pathophysiology of headache disorders, cross-cultural psychology, and health disparities. Formal coursework in these areas will facilitate the successful conduct of the planned study and prepare the candidate for future research endeavors throughout her career. The second objective is to examine how race and psychiatric co-morbid conditions are related to headache severity, quality of life, treatment adherence, and ability to respond favorably to treatments in people with episodic migraines, chronic migraines, episodic tension-type headaches, chronic tension-type headaches, substance abuse headaches, or cluster headaches. Using a quasi-experimental prospective research design, 400 patients presenting at outpatient medical centers in four urban areas of Ohio (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Toledo) will complete self-administered assessments, telephone-based interviews, and daily headache diaries that elicit data on headache severity, quality of life, social support, treatment self-efficacy, locus of control, treatment adherence, and treatment outcome. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; Bandura, 1986), the planned study will employ structural equation modeling path analysis to determine whether SCT constructs, such as social support, health-related locus of control, and treatment self-efficacy, mediate associations between race and the presence of a co-morbid psychiatric disorder and key outcome measures, such as quality of life and treatment outcome. If successful, the candidate will obtain extramural funding prior to the completion of the training program that will enable her to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate a culturally-contextualized intervention to reduce headache pain and improve the life quality of people who experience severe headache characteristics.

"Effects of Cancer Symptoms on Minority Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career goal of Dr. Guadalupe Palos is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral science, with a focus on underserved and minority populations.  The candidate's career plan offers an excellent opportunity to combine her previous training in oncology nursing and community social work with her academic preparation in health service research and behavioral science.  The revised research plan has been greatly simplified and is designed to build upon an NIH-funded longitudinal study of symptoms in patients with advanced lung cancer (Principal Investigator, CS Cleeland, PhD).  The study includes underserved minority and non-minority patients who will receive treatment in an inner city county hospital.  This is an excellent opportunity to study the caregivers of ethnic minorities, who, because of their socioeconomic status, may be highly stressed or overwhelmed compared to other caregivers of cancer patients.       This application integrates mentoring, training, and focused research to meet 3 objectives: a) to become an established investigator in the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches in cancer control and behavioral science; 2) to use these multi-methods approaches to study the problems of caregivers and the patients they care for; and 3) to evaluate the effects of sociocultural factors on the caregiver's experience. Dr. Palos' exceptional mentor team consists of Charles S. Cleeland, PhD, Richard Payne, MD., Marjorie Kagawa-Singer, PhD, and Amalie Ramirez, PhD.  Dr. Cleeland will provide mentorship in research related to measurement of symptoms.  Dr. Payne, world-renown for his work in disparities and pain management will provide mentorship in these areas.  Dr. Singer will be a mentor in the conceptualization and measurement of culture and ethnicity.  Dr. Ramirez will mentor the candidate in developing culturally competent cancer communication for future caregiver interventions.  Formal agreements and specific roles of the mentoring team have been documented and included.  The research training will take place at MD Anderson Cancer Center/Lyndon Baines Hospital, and to a lesser extent at University of California (Dr. Kagawa-Singer), Hispanic Center of Excellence - San Antonio (Dr. Amelie G. Ramirez), and Duke University -Durham, NC (Dr. Payne).       Research examining the negative outcomes in underserved minority caregivers, such as depression, stress, anxiety, pain, fatigue, or sleep disturbances, would help advance our understanding of these problems.

"Hormones/Genes in Women's Health: From Bench to Bedside DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of this BIRCWH proposal is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders, and those disorders specific to women. This application seeks support to create an integrated interdisciplinary training program that will be based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program will be modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption in this BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) will be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. This BIRCWH program will capitalize on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Scholars will be assigned a team of Mentors. In order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner, each of four Scholars will be assigned a Primary and Secondary Mentor. Primary Mentors will be in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors will be in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and will help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. A Career Mentor (senior HMS/HSPH faculty and senior administrators) will advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Finally there will be a Mentor in Health Disparities, who will expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity can be influenced by social/environmental factors. This BIRCWH proposal will focus on the following disorders, given both the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health. They include: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that this BIRCWH proposal is offering an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that will train the next generation of leaders in women's health.

"FACTORS AFFECTING OCD AND HEALTH DISPARITIES AT THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or trastorno obsesivo compulsivo (TOC) as it is known in Spanish-speaking countries, ranks tenth in the World Bank's and World Health Organization's leading causes of disability for persons age five and older. Yet there is a dearth of information on the relationship between culture, ethnicity and OCD, particularly for Hispanic persons with this disorder. The overall objective of this R03 application is to describe, examine and explore issues involving the cultural identification, symptomatology, health concerns, coping mechanisms, and quality of life of persons with OCD in a population at high risk for health disparities, Mexican-American and Mexican persons (MAs and MXs) living in the U.S.-Mexico Border region of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The specific aims of the study include: 1) to describe the cultural identification, symptomatology, health concerns, coping mechanisms, and quality of life issues among Mexican Americans and Mexicans with OCD in the Border region; 2) to compare the relationship between Mexican Americans and Mexican's health concerns, coping mechanisms, quality of life issues and other key research measures (e.g., symptom severity, cultural identification, ethnicity, education and other demographic data); and 3) to explore the implications of these findings in terms of specific, culturally sensitive interventions most likely to be effective in Mexican Americans and Mexican's' real-life situations. This study employs a mixed method approach for understanding the multiple factors affecting OCD and health disparities at the Border. Four tools validated for English- and Spanish-speaking persons will be employed to obtain qualitative and quantitative data and to meet each of the study aims. The qualitative data will provide in-depth information related to treatment and care experiences, coping mechanisms, relationships, and the possible influence of culture, ethnicity and place. The quantitative data will provide demographic information and measures of symptom severity and quality of life. Triangulation of these combined data sets will offer the greatest insight into the complex topic of investigation, thus laying the groundwork for a later, larger-scale study to examine the effects of culturally sensitive interventions to decrease health disparities for MAs and MXs with OCD. Relevance to public health. The widespread and devastating nature of OCD sharply contrasts with the paucity of research involving MAs and MXs who suffer from this condition. This application addresses this knowledge gap with a study which could provide a critical foundation for later research to examine the effects of culturally sensitive interventions to decrease health disparities on a wider scale. As such, this research can provide an important contribution to issues of health disparity.           ",FACTORS AFFECTING OCD AND HEALTH DISPARITIES AT THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER,7127001,R03NR009974,"['Mexico ', ' health ', ' lead ', ' coping ', ' schizophrenia ', ' culture ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R03,2006,74000,0.02792048285050291
"InhibinB as a Marker for Premenstrual Dysphoric Symptoms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the proposed research is to find the causes of severe premenstrual mood and behavior changes, facilitate diagnosis, and speed effective treatment to women seeking help for related disorders. For decades scientists have worked to identify characteristics of the ovarian axis that are associated with premenstrual disorders. Now, results from state-of-the-art endocrine research, the body of knowledge about premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and our pilot study converge to suggest that inhibin B, a new marker of ovarian function, may be a biomarker of PMDD. The Specific Aims are to explore (1) the relationship of inhibin B and PMDD; and (2) to determine whether inhibin B differentiates women with and without PMDD after potential confounders are taken into account (the Aberrant Inhibin B Model). Hypotheses will be examined in a sample of 18 to 53-year-old Hispanic, Black, or White menstruating women with or without PMDD (N = 102). To diagnose PMDD according to DSM criteria, participants will rate symptoms and functioning daily for two menstrual cycles, and complete physical and psychiatric evaluations. In each cycle, participants will give blood samples every 3 days after the onset of menstruation until ovulation occurs as determined by home urinary luteinizing hormone test kits. Inhibin B levels will be measured in serum using ELISA. If inhibin B is a marker of PMDD, this may provide clues to the mechanisms of the disorder, premenstrual exacerbations of other conditions, and emotional reactivity in general. Laboratory studies of inhibin B already have been translated into practice aiding diagnosis of various reproductive conditions. Results of this and subsequent studies may facilitate diagnosis of PMDD. New medications targeting endocrine risk factors for premenstrual disorders ultimately may be discovered. The medications may be more efficacious, and more acceptable to women not wanting antidepressants. Data from minorities and perimenopausal women should help scientists address health disparities. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is one of the most common conditions affecting reproductive age women having a high impact on personal well-being and professional productivity. This study explores the relationship of inhibin B, a new marker of ovarian function, and PMDD. Results are expected to provide clues to the cause of PMDD, facilitate the now burdensome diagnostic process, and lead to new treatments.           ",InhibinB as a Marker for Premenstrual Dysphoric Symptoms,7099094,R21MH074914,"['biomarker ', ' body composition ', ' blood chemistry ', ' diagnostic test ', ' diagnosis design /evaluation ', ' hormone regulation /control mechanism ', ' menstrual cycle ', ' premenstrual syndrome ', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ', ' follicle stimulating hormone ', ' emotional adjustment ', ' mental disorder diagnosis ', ' clinical depression ', ' inhibin ', ' ovary ', ' female ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' age difference ', "" women's health "", ' clinical research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' ']",NIMH,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2006,274641,0.0955438580108768
"Ethnicity and the diagnosis of affective illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative R01 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders.

"A Multiethnic Internet Study on Menopausal Symptoms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing ethnic diversity of the U.S. population requires health professionals to practice with greater cultural competence in areas such as the management of menopausal symptoms, where cultural beliefs mediate the biology of reproduction and aging. A growing number of studies have challenged the universality of menopausal symptoms by indicating significant ethnic differences in how women experience them. However, few investigators have studied ethnic populations in the U.S., and few studies have been national in scope. With advances in computer technologies, the Internet now provides an excellent medium of national and international communication and allows people in different geographical areas to communicate and exchange their experiences and opinions. The proposed study uses innovative Internet data collection methods to collect national data and essential information about specific ethnic differences in menopausal symptom experience while respecting women's own experiences. The specific aims are to: a) explore ethnic differences in menopausal symptom experience reported by 4 of the most common ethnic groups of women across the U.S. (Hispanic, non-Hispanic (N-H) White, N-H African American, and N-H Asian); and b) explore the ethnic-specific contexts of women's daily lives that influence women's self-reported menopausal symptom experience. A feminist approach will guide the research process. Innovative data collection methods will be used, including an Internet survey among 500 middle-aged women recruited using the quota sampling method with multiple recruitment strategies through various Internet settings, and online forums of 6-month duration among 4 different ethnic groups (30 members per group) recruited from among the Internet survey participants. Long-term goals are to: a) contribute to recognition of women's own menopausal symptom experience so that health care can be planned and provided from women's own views and perspectives; b) develop decision support systems for menopausal symptom management that can be validated across diverse practice settings; and c) eliminate ethnic biases and inequity in menopausal symptom management and promote culturally competent care for menopausal women.

"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Region IV South Bleeding Disorders Program is a network of nine federally funded Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs) that provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The Regional Core Center (RCC) office is located in Atlanta, Georgia and shares an office with Hemophilia of Georgia, Inc. The RCC emphasizes a pro-active orientation toward bleeding disorder care. This program will further the mission of the CDC in promoting heath and quality of life in persons with bleeding disorders by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability. The goals and objectives of this regional program were designed to reduce the complications and morbidity associated with bleeding disorders, as well as to promote access to integrated and family-centered services for individuals with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Comprehensive systems of care are necessary, as those receiving care outside of an HTC have a 60% higher mortality rate than those receiving care in federally funded HTCs (CDC). Objectives will focus on those patients from traditionally underserved populations. Prevention programs will strive to reduce the impact on the public health system by, for example, decreasing the number of days missed from work and school. The RCC will be responsible for program evaluation and monitoring through required affiliate reporting, data reports, assessment of Universal Data Collection (UDC) Project participation, site visits, needs assessments, and consumer input. Other specific project objectives include: (1) provide continuous screening for HIV and Hepatitis A, B, and C; (2) facilitate improved regional information management systems, data collection and evaluation; (3) expand the UDC cohort through recruitment of individuals with genetic bleeding disorders; (4) transition the national database to a web-based application; (5) expand the database with additional relevant date related to women's issues and other important clinical outcomes; and (6) address areas of concern unique to Region IV South regarding healthcare disparities. This hemophilia care program strives to improve the quality and years of healthy lives for those living with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Prevention and outreach efforts aimed at the traditionally underserved will eliminate the region's health disparities by providing quality healthcare services, regardless of an individual's race, ethnicity, age, or gender. Particular attention will be paid to the leading health indicators: physical activity, overweight and obesity, immunization and access to health care.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers,7232160,U01DD000201,"['blood coagulation disorder ', ' hemophilia A ', "" von Willebrand's disease "", ' cooperative study ', ' medical complication ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' epidemiology ', ' clinical research ', ' outcomes research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NCBDDD,"HEMOPHILIA OF GEORGIA, INC.",U01,2006,426434,0.06722330882950252
"Barriers to Seeking and Substaining Cardiovascular Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Delaying the decision to seek emergency medical treatment for the symptoms of an acute ischemic event (i.e., acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina) can mean the difference between life and death. Research has shown that women, African Americans, and older persons tend to delay seeking treatment for the symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) longer than middle-aged white men. Delays can lead to the destruction of heart muscle and may lead to poorer recovery, greater disability, and premature death. The purpose of this pilot study is to examine barriers to seeking prompt emergency care for acute ischemic symptoms and to see how these barriers impede sustained cardiovascular care over 6 month period after an acute event. This study will focus on an urban, predominantly older African American population who are admitted for the symptoms for AMI or unstable angina. Participants will be referred by hospital staff and will be interviewed within 5 days of hospitalization for the acute event. Follow-up interviews will take place 3- months and 6-months post-event. Baseline interviews will include questions pertaining to psychosocial factors, perceived and practical barriers to medical care, acute cardiac symptoms, medical comorbidity, knowledge of the warning signs of a heart attack and of personal cardiovascular risk factors, depressive symptomatology, and health cognitions and somatic complaints associated with cardiovascular disease. Follow-up interviews will focus on barriers that impede sustained cardiac care (i.e., treatment and medication compliance, lifestyle changes, and improved well-being). Many patients who experience symptoms of acute ischemia die before they reach the hospital or expire in the emergency room. In an effort to understand the barriers to delay in all acute ischemia patients, a retrospective proxy interview will be conducted among next of kin based on the in-hospital patient interview. The results of this study could play a key role in disentangling cardiovascular disparities among women and African Americans, and lead to the development of an intervention that would focus on lowering practical and perceived barriers to emergency cardiac care and recovery.         ",Barriers to Seeking and Substaining Cardiovascular Care,7100944,R03AG023230,"['human old age (65+) ', ' acute disease /disorder ', ' cardiovascular disorder education ', ' caregiver ', ' emergency care ', ' health care service utilization ', ' angina pectoris ', ' myocardial infarction ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human morbidity ', ' health behavior ', ' depression ', ' female ', ' African American ', ' therapy compliance ', ' quality of life ', "" women's health "", ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R03,2006,74702,0.03990439382147545
"Beneath the Urologic Iceberg: A Qualitative Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The metaphor of an ""illness iceberg"" (Last, 1963; 2001) is employed in recognition of the fact that, while common, some clinically important symptoms never make it to the health care system for effective treatment. Many symptoms are: (a) recognized by individuals, presented for treatment, diagnosed, treated and eventually recorded as a case. Others, however, are: (b) recognized, presented, but not diagnosed, treated, or counted; some symptoms are (c) recognized by individuals but not presented (possibly receiving self care); while others (d) are not recognized and never presented, treated or counted. Building on the epidemiologic findings from the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) survey (DK56842), this qualitative research is designed to explore the submerged areas of urologic disease, in order to understand reported disparities in help-seeking for a specific constellation of symptoms (Urinary Incontinence, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome), by race/ethnicity, gender, age and SES. BACH is revealing how different sociocultural groups respond to these urologic symptoms; this complementary qualitative research is designed to explain why. BACH subjects (already identified) will be randomly selected to fill specific design cells. Established qualitative techniques will be employed by experienced investigators to elicit information on values, beliefs, norms, attributions, barriers and the perceived stigma associated with urologic symptoms. Several features are designed to overcome perceived limitations of qualitative research (representativeness, external validity and replicability). The project has high public health significance: (1) There are few in-depth studies of the ""urologic iceberg"" being uncovered by the BACH study; (2) It represents a practical and focused approach to an emerging area of health disparities; (3) It highlights a flaw in reported urologic disease rates (only those presenting get counted); and (4) Better understanding of help-seeking can improve the everyday clinical management of disease.         ",Beneath the Urologic Iceberg: A Qualitative Study,7026128,R01DK073835,"['health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' epidemiology ', ' health behavior ', ' gender difference ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' urinary tract disorder ', ' interstitial cystitis ', ' urinary tract disorder diagnosis ', ' urinary incontinence ', ' age difference ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIDDK,"NEW ENGLAND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R01,2006,337246,0.08525804851362123
"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this program is to prevent complications of hemophilia and other bleeding disorders through assessment, surveillance, outreach, education, consultation, and management. A regional network of ten hemophilia treatment centers in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee will be coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. In 2005, Region IV-North (comprising nine hemophilia treatment centers [HTCs] in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee) had a total of 1,848 active patients with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. Hemophilia patients constitute 61.5% of the total patients, while 27.6% have von Willebrand disease and 10.9% have other bleeding disorders. In 2005, there were 380 active female patients, an increase of 25.2% over the 2004 total. Almost 22% of the active patients are from ethnic minority groups, with an explosive increase in Hispanics. In comparison to U.S. averages, there are higher poverty rates and lower educational levels within the region, predisposing individuals to suboptimal behaviors in relation to diet, exercise, and use of health care services. The network will collaborate with regional lay organizations and the four non-federally funded centers in the region to deliver appropriately tailored prevention messages aimed at reducing complications of bleeding disorders and improving health across the lifespan, with the intention of attaining and measuring specific outcomes to reduce complications. Further, the region will redouble its outreach to underserved populations, such as women and minorities, to integrate them into the HTC system. All of these efforts will be systematically evaluated to assess their efficacy. Surveillance of patients enrolled in the CDC's Universal Data Collection (UDC) project, which has collected samples and data from over 18,000 individuals nationally since 1998, will continue in order to monitor the safety of the blood supply. The network will also expand upon the UDC program to collect data that could be used for clinical research projects leading to improved health outcomes for individuals with bleeding disorders, accelerated adoption of healthy behaviors, the reduction or elimination of health disparities among various ethnic and racial groups and between genders, and the achievement of greater efficiency in the core public health infrastructure.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs,7232169,U01DD000199,"['blood coagulation disorder ', ' hemophilia A ', "" von Willebrand's disease "", ' cooperative study ', ' medical complication ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' epidemiology ', ' clinical research ', ' outcomes research ', ' ']",NCBDDD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2006,568206,0.04356228954973102
"Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to prevent the complications of hemophilia and bleeding disorders through the expansion and acquisition of clinical data sets. These data sets will include both disease-specific and general-health related information. The data acquired will be used for proactive implementation of prevention programs throughout the network of multidisciplinary comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) throughout the United States. HTC's are designed to treat patients with hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand Disease and rare factor deficiencies. Utilizing the comprehensive care model, therapeutic interventions based on previously collected data and changes in therapy based on new research continues to enhance the care of the bleeding disorders community. Chronic genetic disorders often require complex and multidisciplinary care for optimal diagnosis, treatment and management. The consequences of bleeding disorders include severe medical, financial, vocational, psychological and familial repercussions when the condition is not properly managed. The lack of proper treatment has general public health consequences such as increased costs of care caused by increased hospital and emergency utilization and patient disability that may require welfare and other government entitlements. A regional approach to planning, coordination and allocation of funds is vital to ensure that services are available to treat this and other complicated bleeding disorders in Region II, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The proposed program will continue a national network of federally funded HTCs organized through 12 regional core centers and funded by the CDC. Aim 1: To provide comprehensive prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders directed at attaining and measuring specific outcomes through research and surveillance aimed at reducing complications using a multidisciplinary approach. Under this aim we propose to expand the cohort through continued recruitment and observation individuals with genetic bleeding disorders including hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand disease, rare bleeding disorders and women with bleeding disorders; and expand the current Universal Data and Serum Specimen Collection System (UDC) database to collect additional relevant data related to women's issues in coagulation, rare bleeding disorders, prophylaxis, factor utilization, inhibitors, genetic mutations, and other important clinical outcomes. We plan to design and pilot additional studies aimed at further characterizing the bleeding disorders population through the expanded access to a) gene-based diagnosis and b) more precise definition of the biochemical phenotype (e.g. global assays) with the ultimate goal of genotype - phenotype correlation; utilize the UDC BMI data to evaluate the cost impact on the health care system from conditions with weight-based dosing; test interventions that could facilitate weight loss; and design and pilot a study to evaluate effects of rising annual out- of-pocket expenses and co-payments on the use of elective/preventive services provided by the HTC. Aim 2: Maintain A Regional Network Of Comprehensive Prevention Services Through Hemophilia Treatment Centers to Persons With Hemophilia and Related Disorders Including Women, Minorities and the Underserved. Under this broad aim we will lay out our comprehensive, culturally sensitive, family-centered care services and their expansion, our communication within the region and administrative mechanisms. These include outreach and education, orientation and training programs, maintenance of appropriate management and evaluation systems, maintenance of a prevention evaluation network to assess the efficacy of prevention services by increasing the capacity for data collection, moving from paper to electronic and our participation in the coordinating committee. Our plan as stated will promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Many of our aims will facilitate reducing health disparities and accelerate the adoption of health behaviors while improving prevention effectiveness through cost-based studies. Some aims will be directly transferable to other chronic disease populations in the general public such as the evaluation of obesity and menorrhagia.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers,7231886,U01DD000195,"['blood coagulation disorder ', ' hemophilia A ', "" von Willebrand's disease "", ' cooperative study ', ' medical complication ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' epidemiology ', ' clinical research ', ' outcomes research ', ' ']",NCBDDD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2006,733083,0.06925915048150486
"Symptom Relief and Social Support in Parent Training DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad goal of this project is to better understand mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of behavioral parent-training interventions aimed at child externalizing behavior. More specifically, the present set of studies seeks to accomplish three goals by experimentally manipulating certain parameters of a parent training intervention: First, they attempt to elucidate the role that parental social support plays in the retention, outcome, and maintenance of families who receive parent-training. Second, they seek to examine whether altering the sequence of parent-training topics produces more rapid symptom relief in dysfunctional parenting and whether such immediate improvements reduce parent drop-out and improve outcomes. Third, they seek to examine how gains made in parenting skill and child behavior are maintained after the initial parent-training intervention has ended.  Correlational data suggest that rapid symptom relief and robust social support improve the outcomes seen with parent-training interventions. However, there is little experimental evidence to support the contention that these two variables have such effects. It is hypothesized that initial symptom relief and robust social support significantly contribute to retaining parents in treatment and increasing the probability that parents will experience improvements in parenting, and in turn, children will experience corresponding improvement in externalizing behavior. It is further hypothesized that increased post-intervention parent therapist contact will significantly improve the maintenance of gains seen immediately post treatment. This experiment employs random assignment of 120 parent-child dyads seeking treatment for the child's externalizing behavior, to test and examine theory about the role of initial symptom reduction, parental social support, and post-intervention therapist-parent contact on parent-training outcomes.  Convincing support for these two relationships could significantly alter the way that parent-training interventions are implemented, leading to increases in the percentages of families who benefit from such interventions.

The first objective is to provide the minority candidate with contemporary training in the areas of statistics, research methodology, research ethics, the pathophysiology of headache disorders, cross-cultural psychology, and health disparities. Formal coursework in these areas will facilitate the successful conduct of the planned study and prepare the candidate for future research endeavors throughout her career. The second objective is to examine how race and psychiatric co-morbid conditions are related to headache severity, quality of life, treatment adherence, and ability to respond favorably to treatments in people with episodic migraines, chronic migraines, episodic tension-type headaches, chronic tension-type headaches, substance abuse headaches, or cluster headaches. Using a quasi-experimental prospective research design, 400 patients presenting at outpatient medical centers in four urban areas of Ohio (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Toledo) will complete self-administered assessments, telephone-based interviews, and daily headache diaries that elicit data on headache severity, quality of life, social support, treatment self-efficacy, locus of control, treatment adherence, and treatment outcome. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; Bandura, 1986), the planned study will employ structural equation modeling path analysis to determine whether SCT constructs, such as social support, health-related locus of control, and treatment self-efficacy, mediate associations between race and the presence of a co-morbid psychiatric disorder and key outcome measures, such as quality of life and treatment outcome. If successful, the candidate will obtain extramural funding prior to the completion of the training program that will enable her to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate a culturally-contextualized intervention to reduce headache pain and improve the life quality of people who experience severe headache characteristics.

"Occupational Skin Disease Among Minority Farmworkers    DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) Everyone who works in agriculture is exposed to numerous environmental risk factors (weather, mechanical devices, chemicals, animals, wild plants, organic and inorganic dust, fungi) that can result in occupational injury and illness. Occupational skin disease (OSD) is a widely acknowledged, but poorly documented, occupational illness among all agricultural workers. Environmental risks are especially great for migrant and seasonal farm-workers. Most farm-workers are Latino immigrants, with the vast majority being from Mexico. Due to their lack of workplace control and limited treatment options, OSD among farm-workers must be examined in a health disparities and environmental justice framework. This study will employ in-depth interviews, surveillance, and a clinic-based study to:  1) delineate farm-worker interpretations of OSD symptomatology, etiology, self-care behaviors, and barriers to prevention and treatment seeking; 2) estimate the prevalence of OSD across the work season; 3) determine the risk factors for (a) the presence and severity of OSD symptoms, including work activities and exposures, environmental factors, farm-worker biological and personal characteristics, preventive behaviors, and treatment behaviors, and (b) skin-related quality of life; and 4) determine the predictors of OSD severity and specific diagnoses among farm-workers who present to migrant health clinics. Guided by a biopsychosocial model that acknowledges the multiple factors that determine the presence and severity of skin symptoms, and the impact of symptom severity on quality of life, this project will produce the first prospective data on occupational skin disease and its risk factors among migrant and seasonal farm-workers. The results of this project will be used in subsequent projects to address our long-term goal of reducing environmental risk for OSD among all agricultural workers. The project will be completed in an area of eastern North Carolina in which a large number of farm-workers are employed. There are 3 research components for this 4- year project. First, in-depth interviews will be used to elicit farm-workers' Explanatory Models for OSD. Second, a prospective surveillance study will follow 225 farmworker at 8 points during an agricultural season to delineate farm-worker perceptions of OSD symptoms, dermatological quality of life, and OSD risk factors. Finally, a clinic study will use telemedicine procedures to diagnosis OSD among 150 farm-workers who present at migrant clinics and delineate the risks associated with these diagnoses.         ",Occupational Skin Disease Among Minority Farmworkers,7002720,R01ES012358,"['telemedicine ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' sign /symptom ', ' environmental health ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' self care ', ' community health service ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' occupational disease /disorder ', ' agriculture worker ', ' epidemiology ', ' health behavior ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' perception ', ' skin disorder ', ' skin disorder diagnosis ', ' Hispanic American ', ' Mexican American ', ' migrant ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' disease /disorder etiology ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' rural health ', ' ']",NIEHS,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,400516,0.04035971845444958

"Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Comprehensive hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) received their first federal funding from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration in 1975. Regional networks developed enabling and strengthening intra- and inter-state cooperation and collaboration. In 1995, the CDC provided direct funding to the twelve hemophilia regions following a Congressional mandate to monitor blood product safety and hemophilia disease progression, including arthropathy. During the past ten years funds from the Hematologic Disease Branch has assisted Region X (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington) with building center and regional infrastructure including expanded data collection capabilities for surveillance. Funds have also enhanced inter-regional collaboration in the US West. The Universal Data and Serum Specimen collection System for Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders has been enrolling participants since 1997/98 and has provided a robust data bank. During the next five years, Region X in collaboration with other federal regions will begin more focused public health research with the hemophilia and bleeding disorders community that may be extrapolated to other populations with chronic conditions and diagnoses. Region X is an area of the United States with urban, rural and frontier counties. The majority of the population in this region lives north of the 45th parallel. The region also has an incidence of obesity and overweight in hemophilia patients and the general region that mirrors the national averages. The Region X research interests include: 1) whether the health disparities experienced by rural and frontier citizens also extends to persons with bleeding disorders or does care for a bleeding disorder provided by HTCs decrease the health disparities; 2) whether persons living in counties without physicians and/or hospitals have poorer physical and health outcomes compared to others with similar diagnosis, especially persons with milder severity; 3) the impact of less ambient vitamin D on joint disease and bone health/density; and 4) the relationship between perceived ability to engage in activity, actual level of activity, unemployment due to disability, pain and quality of life.          ",Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs,7232161,U01DD000200,"['blood coagulation disorder ', ' hemophilia A ', "" von Willebrand's disease "", ' cooperative study ', ' medical complication ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' epidemiology ', ' joint disorder ', ' clinical research ', ' outcomes research ', ' blood bank /supply contamination ', ' ']",NCBDDD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2006,267382,0.0226254381967386
"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative R01 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to increased antipsychotic use in African-Americans. The final objective is to determine whether Latinos are at risk for similar problems in diagnostic assessments and treatment assignment.

"SSRI-INDUCED CHANGES IN CORTICAL GABA IN WOMEN WITH PMDD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a distinct disorder that effects at least 3% of menstruating women, is associated with significant functional impairment. That PMDD is preferentially responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment provides strong evidence that serotonergic dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology, as well as, treatment of PMDD. However, there are substantial clinical and preclinical data to implicate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system as a mediator of the clinical efficacy of SSRIs in this disorder. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (IH-MRS), our group has found that women with PMDD have abnormal central GABAergic regulation in response to menstrual cycle-related fluctuations in neuroactive steroids. Cortical GABA concentrations fluctuate across the menstrual cycle in a diagnosis- and phase-specific fashion with the greatest disparity in cortical GABA levels during the follicular phase, when women with PMDD had significantly lower cortical GABA levels than healthy menstruating controls. Presently, it is unclear whether inhibition of serotonin reuptake or alternatively SSRI modulation of GABAergic function is crucial in the therapeutic action of SSRIs in the treatment of PMDD. In support of the latter, animal and human studies have shown that SSRI administration enhances central production of the potent GABAA receptor agonist, allopregnanolone (ALLO). At baseline, women with PMDD fail to demonstrate a normal GABAergic response to endogenous or exogenous exposure to ALLO. Further, we have found that successful SSRI treatment is associated with an increase in occipital cortical GABA levels during the follicular phase in women with PMDD, essentially ""righting"" the abnormal cyclic changes in GABA seen in these women prior to treatment. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is two-fold; to confirm these early 1H-MRS findings in a group of women undergoing fluoxetine treatment for PMDD and to determine the impact of fluoxetine treatment on the relationship between occipital cortex GABA levels and plasma ALLO levels across the menstrual cycle. We anticipate that our findings will provide further support for the role of GABA and neurosteroids in the pathogenesis and treatment of PMDD.

"A Multiethnic Internet Study on Menopausal Symptoms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing ethnic diversity of the U.S. population requires health professionals to practice with greater cultural competence in areas such as the management of menopausal symptoms, where cultural beliefs mediate the biology of reproduction and aging. A growing number of studies have challenged the universality of menopausal symptoms by indicating significant ethnic differences in how women experience them. However, few investigators have studied ethnic populations in the U.S., and few studies have been national in scope. With advances in computer technologies, the Internet now provides an excellent medium of national and international communication and allows people in different geographical areas to communicate and exchange their experiences and opinions. The proposed study uses innovative Internet data collection methods to collect national data and essential information about specific ethnic differences in menopausal symptom experience while respecting women's own experiences. The specific aims are to: a) explore ethnic differences in menopausal symptom experience reported by 4 of the most common ethnic groups of women across the U.S. (Hispanic, non-Hispanic (N-H) White, N-H African American, and N-H Asian); and b) explore the ethnic-specific contexts of women's daily lives that influence women's self-reported menopausal symptom experience. A feminist approach will guide the research process. Innovative data collection methods will be used, including an Internet survey among 500 middle-aged women recruited using the quota sampling method with multiple recruitment strategies through various Internet settings, and online forums of 6-month duration among 4 different ethnic groups (30 members per group) recruited from among the Internet survey participants. Long-term goals are to: a) contribute to recognition of women's own menopausal symptom experience so that health care can be planned and provided from women's own views and perspectives; b) develop decision support systems for menopausal symptom management that can be validated across diverse practice settings; and c) eliminate ethnic biases and inequity in menopausal symptom management and promote culturally competent care for menopausal women.

"Center for Reducing Risks in Vulnerable Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall purpose of the Center for Reducing Risks in Vulnerable Populations (CRRVP) is to (a) advance the science of bio-behavioral health for vulnerable populations, emphasizing issues associated with vulnerability related age (very young and elderly),   minority status, and lower socioeconomic status; (b) reduce disparities in disease/illness; and (c) support research training by providing core services and resources to investigators. The work of the CRRVP will be accomplished through three research cores (a) Multi-ethnic Emphasis Core, (b) Bio-behavioral Methods Core and (c) Development and Dissemination Core. The CRRVP will sponsor research to advance the science in bio-behavioral health for vulnerable populations and in the year four novice investigators will be funded to conduct pilot studies. The science of the CRRVP is organized by a bio-behavioral and health-related quality of life framework. Key elements in this framework include person (individual) factors, environmental factors, physiological and psychological variables, symptom status, functional status, general health perception, and quality of life. Studies supported by the CRRVP will (a) reduce disparity and promote healthy life styles for vulnerable populations, (b) elucidate underlying physiological and psychological mechanisms that contribute to symptoms, functional status, perceived health status and quality of life, (c) test interventions to minimize symptoms, enhance functional status, perceived health status and quality of life. The research supported by the CRRVP will have a strong bio-behavioral orientation with an emphasis on potential/real health problems experienced by people who are very young, elderly, minorities and/or lower socioeconomic status. In addition, the CRRVP will have a strong emphasis on facilitating multi-ethnic research and reducing disparity in health through research. The combining of research related to vulnerable populations under the umbrella of a single center is a strength to overlaps in the science that have not been explored.

"Beneath the Urologic Iceberg: A Qualitative Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The metaphor of an ""illness iceberg"" (Last, 1963; 2001) is employed in recognition of the fact that, while common, some clinically important symptoms never make it to the health care system for effective treatment. Many symptoms are: (a) recognized by individuals, presented for treatment, diagnosed, treated and eventually recorded as a case. Others, however, are: (b) recognized, presented, but not diagnosed, treated, or counted; some symptoms are (c) recognized by individuals but not presented (possibly receiving self care); while others (d) are not recognized and never presented, treated or counted. Building on the epidemiologic findings from the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) survey (DK56842), this qualitative research is designed to explore the submerged areas of urologic disease, in order to understand reported disparities in help-seeking for a specific constellation of symptoms (Urinary Incontinence, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome), by race/ethnicity, gender, age and SES. BACH is revealing how different sociocultural groups respond to these urologic symptoms; this complementary qualitative research is designed to explain why. BACH subjects (already identified) will be randomly selected to fill specific design cells. Established qualitative techniques will be employed by experienced investigators to elicit information on values, beliefs, norms, attributions, barriers and the perceived stigma associated with urologic symptoms. Several features are designed to overcome perceived limitations of qualitative research (representativeness, external validity and replicability). The project has high public health significance: (1) There are few in-depth studies of the ""urologic iceberg"" being uncovered by the BACH study; (2) It represents a practical and focused approach to an emerging area of health disparities; (3) It highlights a flaw in reported urologic disease rates (only those presenting get counted); and (4) Better understanding of help-seeking can improve the everyday clinical management of disease.         ",Beneath the Urologic Iceberg: A Qualitative Study,7232736,R01DK073835,"['Decision Making ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Iceberg ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' End Point ', ' Caring ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Range ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' painful bladder syndrome ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' urologic ', ' urological ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' Literature ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Respondent ', ' Interstitial Cystitis ', ' Metaphor ', ' Patients ', ' Daily ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Urologic Diseases ', ' urinary tract disorder ', ' Urological Disorders ', ' Urological Diseases ', ' Urologic Disorder ', ' Urinary Tract Diseases ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Class ', ' Belief ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Services ', ' lower urinary tract symptoms ', ' experience ', ' independency ', ' care seeking ', ' Boston ', ' Study Subject ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Count ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Conceptions ', ' ']",NIDDK,"NEW ENGLAND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R01,2007,379315,0.08525804851362123

"Pilot Testing a Peer-based Intervention for Symptom Management-HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this training grant application (F31) is to provide the predoctoral support to allow the investigator to test a peer-based, behavior change intervention to help women living with HIV disease control general, psychosocial and gynecological symptoms. Specifically, the applicant wants to determine if the proposed peer-based intervention for Symptom Management (PRISM-HIV) program reduces symptom intensity, increases perceived self-efficacy and increases quality of life in HIV positive women. Theory: The theoretical frameworks that will guide the development and peer based implementation of the intervention are Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Theory of Participatory Education. Methods: The study design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 124 women living with HIV disease will be randomized into one of two conditions following two baseline measurements. The two conditions are the experimental condition which will receive the peer-based intervention focusing on HIV symptom management and the control condition which will receive usual care for the six months. Analysis: The data will be analyzed by separate, repeated measures analysis of variance. We will explore the potential differences in the dependent variables (symptom intensity, perceived self-efficacy and the quality of life) at the conclusion of the study. These analyses will allow the student investigator to answer the main question of the study, i.e. the feasibility and effectiveness of the peer-led symptom management intervention. Significance: There is an increase in the number of women living with HIV disease in the United States. As the burden of HIV disease among U.S women increases, the need for community based, and chronic care interventions becomes more imperative to the health of those living with HIV and the communities in which they live. The proposed intervention would help to meet this need. Relevance to NIH goals: This application meets the goals of the National Institutes of Health in the following ways. It allows the applicant to apply current biobehavioral knowledge to a new research area, chronic symptom management in women living with HIV; it will provide new information on our ability to prevent disease by providing information on preventing HIV transmission and HIV-related diseases; it expands our knowledge on a community-based intervention that has the potential to decrease economic burden of HIV diseases in the Unites States; and it will be conducted in a responsible manner that promotes scientific integrity, public accountability and social responsibility in the conduct of science.           ",Pilot Testing a Peer-based Intervention for Symptom Management-HIV,7329111,F31NR009910,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Prohibit ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Social Accountability ', ' Social Responsibility ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Today ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Self Management ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Chronic Care ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2007,30874,0.08525358219764013
"Hormones/Genes in Women's Health: From Bench to Bedside DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of this BIRCWH proposal is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders, and those disorders specific to women. This application seeks support to create an integrated interdisciplinary training program that will be based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program will be modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption in this BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) will be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. This BIRCWH program will capitalize on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Scholars will be assigned a team of Mentors. In order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner, each of four Scholars will be assigned a Primary and Secondary Mentor. Primary Mentors will be in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors will be in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and will help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. A Career Mentor (senior HMS/HSPH faculty and senior administrators) will advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Finally there will be a Mentor in Health Disparities, who will expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity can be influenced by social/environmental factors. This BIRCWH proposal will focus on the following disorders, given both the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health. They include: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that this BIRCWH proposal is offering an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that will train the next generation of leaders in women's health.

"Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to prevent the complications of hemophilia and bleeding disorders through the expansion and acquisition of clinical data sets. These data sets will include both disease-specific and general-health related information. The data acquired will be used for proactive implementation of prevention programs throughout the network of multidisciplinary comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) throughout the United States. HTC's are designed to treat patients with hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand Disease and rare factor deficiencies. Utilizing the comprehensive care model, therapeutic interventions based on previously collected data and changes in therapy based on new research continues to enhance the care of the bleeding disorders community. Chronic genetic disorders often require complex and multidisciplinary care for optimal diagnosis, treatment and management. The consequences of bleeding disorders include severe medical, financial, vocational, psychological and familial repercussions when the condition is not properly managed. The lack of proper treatment has general public health consequences such as increased costs of care caused by increased hospital and emergency utilization and patient disability that may require welfare and other government entitlements. A regional approach to planning, coordination and allocation of funds is vital to ensure that services are available to treat this and other complicated bleeding disorders in Region II, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The proposed program will continue a national network of federally funded HTCs organized through 12 regional core centers and funded by the CDC. Aim 1: To provide comprehensive prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders directed at attaining and measuring specific outcomes through research and surveillance aimed at reducing complications using a multidisciplinary approach. Under this aim we propose to expand the cohort through continued recruitment and observation individuals with genetic bleeding disorders including hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand disease, rare bleeding disorders and women with bleeding disorders; and expand the current Universal Data and Serum Specimen Collection System (UDC) database to collect additional relevant data related to women's issues in coagulation, rare bleeding disorders, prophylaxis, factor utilization, inhibitors, genetic mutations, and other important clinical outcomes. We plan to design and pilot additional studies aimed at further characterizing the bleeding disorders population through the expanded access to a) gene-based diagnosis and b) more precise definition of the biochemical phenotype (e.g. global assays) with the ultimate goal of genotype - phenotype correlation; utilize the UDC BMI data to evaluate the cost impact on the health care system from conditions with weight-based dosing; test interventions that could facilitate weight loss; and design and pilot a study to evaluate effects of rising annual out- of-pocket expenses and co-payments on the use of elective/preventive services provided by the HTC. Aim 2: Maintain A Regional Network Of Comprehensive Prevention Services Through Hemophilia Treatment Centers to Persons With Hemophilia and Related Disorders Including Women, Minorities and the Underserved. Under this broad aim we will lay out our comprehensive, culturally sensitive, family-centered care services and their expansion, our communication within the region and administrative mechanisms. These include outreach and education, orientation and training programs, maintenance of appropriate management and evaluation systems, maintenance of a prevention evaluation network to assess the efficacy of prevention services by increasing the capacity for data collection, moving from paper to electronic and our participation in the coordinating committee. Our plan as stated will promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Many of our aims will facilitate reducing health disparities and accelerate the adoption of health behaviors while improving prevention effectiveness through cost-based studies. Some aims will be directly transferable to other chronic disease populations in the general public such as the evaluation of obesity and menorrhagia.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers,7279264,U01DD000195,[''],NCBDDD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2007,746880,0.06925915048150486
"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this program is to prevent complications of hemophilia and other bleeding disorders through assessment, surveillance, outreach, education, consultation, and management. A regional network of ten hemophilia treatment centers in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee will be coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. In 2005, Region IV-North (comprising nine hemophilia treatment centers [HTCs] in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee) had a total of 1,848 active patients with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. Hemophilia patients constitute 61.5% of the total patients, while 27.6% have von Willebrand disease and 10.9% have other bleeding disorders. In 2005, there were 380 active female patients, an increase of 25.2% over the 2004 total. Almost 22% of the active patients are from ethnic minority groups, with an explosive increase in Hispanics. In comparison to U.S. averages, there are higher poverty rates and lower educational levels within the region, predisposing individuals to suboptimal behaviors in relation to diet, exercise, and use of health care services. The network will collaborate with regional lay organizations and the four non-federally funded centers in the region to deliver appropriately tailored prevention messages aimed at reducing complications of bleeding disorders and improving health across the lifespan, with the intention of attaining and measuring specific outcomes to reduce complications. Further, the region will redouble its outreach to underserved populations, such as women and minorities, to integrate them into the HTC system. All of these efforts will be systematically evaluated to assess their efficacy. Surveillance of patients enrolled in the CDC's Universal Data Collection (UDC) project, which has collected samples and data from over 18,000 individuals nationally since 1998, will continue in order to monitor the safety of the blood supply. The network will also expand upon the UDC program to collect data that could be used for clinical research projects leading to improved health outcomes for individuals with bleeding disorders, accelerated adoption of healthy behaviors, the reduction or elimination of health disparities among various ethnic and racial groups and between genders, and the achievement of greater efficiency in the core public health infrastructure.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs,7279179,U01DD000199,[''],NCBDDD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2007,581687,0.04356228954973102
"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative RO1 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to increased antipsychotic use in African-Americans. The final objective is to determine whether Latinos are at risk for similar problems in diagnostic assessments and treatment assignment.

"The Effect of Gonadal Steriods on Pavlovian Fear Conditioning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of anxiety and fear dysregulation are highly prevalent. It is known that these disorders affect women approximately two times more than they affect men, and this disparity is thought to be related to hormone regulation, yet the underlying mechanism of hormone regulation of the fear circuit in either sex remains unknown. The purpose of this Exploratory/ Developmental Grant proposal, in response to PA-03-169, is to develop a more informative and accurate method to determine the effect that gonadal hormones have on fear in both male and female animals. Here, we will employ a new adapted version of the discrimination training paradigm AX+.BX-, along with the use of highly specific estrogen receptor agonists and an androgen receptor-specific testosterone metabolite, to measure the effect that activation of specific gonadal steroid receptors have on both the activation and inhibition of fear. The specific aims of this project are: 1. to validate the use of the AX+, BX- discrimination learning paradigm as a model for examining hormone modulation of fear acquisition, expression and inhibition. 2. to use this model to examine: the effect of gonadal steroids on fear acquisition, and the effect of gonadal steroids on fear expression, in gonadectomized male and female rats. Data from these studies will begin to elucidate the specific effects that these steroid hormones have on very particular aspects of emotional memory formation and expression in general, and moreover, these studies will help to clarify the contribution that the various gonadal steroids make to fear learning in each individual sex . Results from these investigations would not only speak to the development, and expression of emotional learning within each individual sex, but will also begin to address the gender disparity in the occurrence of PTSD, depression and anxiety illness, and panic disorder.           ",The Effect of Gonadal Steriods on Pavlovian Fear Conditioning,7197127,R21MH076869,"['Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination Learning ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' conditioned fear ', ' fear conditioning ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Affect ', ' Hippocampal Formation ', ' base ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Agonist ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Androstenediols ', ' delta 5-Androstene-3 beta,17 beta-Diol ', ' Hermaphrodiol ', ' Delta 5-Androstenediol ', ' Androst-5-ene-3,17-diol, (3beta,17beta)- ', ' Androst-5-ene-3,17-diol ', ' Androst-5-ene-3 beta,17 beta-Diol ', ' 5-Androstene-3beta-17beta-Diol ', ' 5-Androstene-3,17-diol ', ' steroid hormone ', ' Therapeutic Steroid Hormone ', ' Gonadal Hormones ', ' Panic Disorder ', ' panic anxiety syndrome ', ' Animals ', ' Pathology ', ' Play ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Stanolone ', ' Therapeutic Androstanolone ', ' Dihydrotestosterone ', ' Androstanolone ', ' Androstan-3-one, 17-hydroxy-, (5alpha,17beta)- ', ' 5-alpha-DHT ', ' 5 alpha-Dihydrotestosterone ', ' 17beta-Hydroxy-5alpha-Androstan-3-One ', ' Steroids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Androstenediol ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Reporting ', ' Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators ', ' SERMs ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' hormone regulation ', ' hormonal regulation ', ' Cognition ', ' conditioning ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,213333,0.014265857591203334
"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed.  Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative R01 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups.

"A First-Line Community-Based Mindfulness Trauma Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, ""Mindfulness-Based Trauma Interventions: Healing the Whole Person"" outlines a research program for developing an Intervention Development to Services: Exploratory Research Grant (R34). Our overall goal is to address the huge mental health care disparity for low-income, minority women exposed to intimate partner violence by obtaining new knowledge and skills in order to develop and test an accessible, tailored, and culturally-appropriate mindfulness-based intervention suitable as a first-line intervention or delivery in non-mental health community settings. Mindfulness is described as ""bringing one's complete attention to the present experience on a moment- to-moment basis"" (Marlatt & Kristeller, 1999, p. 68). Mindfulness interventions have been developed to address an array of physical and mental health problems (Baer, 2003). However, none address the needs of trauma populations. The devastating effects of violence extend to both mental and physical health problems. Notably, violence has been identified as one of the ten leading health indicators in Health People 2010. PTSD is a particularly prevalent outcome of IPV, with some studies reporting more than three- quarters of battered women meeting diagnostic criteria (e.g., Jones, 2001; Kemp, et al. 1995). To narrow the remarkable mental health disparities gap, three interrelated studies using different methodologies will be conducted to develop and pilot test an adapted mindfulness-based trauma intervention. This application has three specific aims all of which are congruent with the stated mission of the NIMH R34: 1) to develop a mindfulness-based trauma intervention for PTSD and other trauma-related psychological (depression, somatic symptoms, quality of life). Intervention development will include writing intervention and training manuals, developing measures of intervention fidelity, and pre-piloting the intervention for feasibility and accountability; 2) to pilot test the interventions with low-income, predominately African-American women exposed to intimate partner violence and to examine potential mediators (mindfulness, coping self- efficacy, social support) of improved outcomes, and 3) to pilot test measures of the cost of administering the intervention. This pilot study will provide preliminary data for a rigorous large scale clinical trial to examine both self-report and biological outcomes of the mindfulness-based trauma intervention. Mindfulness is described as ""bringing one's complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis"" (Marlatt & Kristeller, 1999, p. 68). The purpose of the application, ""Mindfulness-Based Trauma Interventions: Healing the Whole Person"" is to develop and test a mindfulness-based intervention that is appropriate and suitable in community settings for women with a history of intimate partner violence and who are experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. This application has three specific aims all of which are congruent with the stated mission of the NIMH R34: 1) to develop a mindfulness-based trauma intervention for PTSD and other trauma-related psychological (depression, somatic symptoms, quality of life); 2) to pilot test the interventions with low-income, African-American women exposed to intimate partner violence, and 3) to measure the cost of administering the intervention.

"Occupational Skin Disease Among Minority Farmworkers    DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) Everyone who works in agriculture is exposed to numerous environmental risk factors (weather, mechanical devices, chemicals, animals, wild plants, organic and inorganic dust, fungi) that can result in occupational injury and illness. Occupational skin disease (OSD) is a widely acknowledged, but poorly documented, occupational illness among all agricultural workers. Environmental risks are especially great for migrant and seasonal farm-workers. Most farm-workers are Latino immigrants, with the vast majority being from Mexico. Due to their lack of workplace control and limited treatment options, OSD among farm-workers must be examined in a health disparities and environmental justice framework. This study will employ in-depth interviews, surveillance, and a clinic-based study to:  1) delineate farm-worker interpretations of OSD symptomatology, etiology, self-care behaviors, and barriers to prevention and treatment seeking; 2) estimate the prevalence of OSD across the work season; 3) determine the risk factors for (a) the presence and severity of OSD symptoms, including work activities and exposures, environmental factors, farm-worker biological and personal characteristics, preventive behaviors, and treatment behaviors, and (b) skin-related quality of life; and 4) determine the predictors of OSD severity and specific diagnoses among farm-workers who present to migrant health clinics. Guided by a biopsychosocial model that acknowledges the multiple factors that determine the presence and severity of skin symptoms, and the impact of symptom severity on quality of life, this project will produce the first prospective data on occupational skin disease and its risk factors among migrant and seasonal farm-workers. The results of this project will be used in subsequent projects to address our long-term goal of reducing environmental risk for OSD among all agricultural workers. The project will be completed in an area of eastern North Carolina in which a large number of farm-workers are employed. There are 3 research components for this 4- year project. First, in-depth interviews will be used to elicit farm-workers' Explanatory Models for OSD. Second, a prospective surveillance study will follow 225 farmworker at 8 points during an agricultural season to delineate farm-worker perceptions of OSD symptoms, dermatological quality of life, and OSD risk factors. Finally, a clinic study will use telemedicine procedures to diagnosis OSD among 150 farm-workers who present at migrant clinics and delineate the risks associated with these diagnoses.         ",Occupational Skin Disease Among Minority Farmworkers,7191595,R01ES012358,"['Crowding ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Dust ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Telemedicine ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Housing ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Industry ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Chemicals ', ' farmer ', ' Justice ', ' Language ', ' Numbers ', ' Agricultural Workers ', ' agriculture worker ', ' Measurement ', ' Mexico ', ' Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' Immigrant ', ' North Carolina ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Wild Animals ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Plants ', ' Inflammatory ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Seasons ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' skin disorder ', ' Skin Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Skin Diseases ', ' Dermatoses ', ' Cutaneous Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Time ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Occupational ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Employee ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' ']",NIEHS,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,364138,0.04035971845444958

"Effects of Cancer Symptoms on Minority Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career goal of Dr. Guadalupe Palos is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral science, with a focus on underserved and minority populations.  The candidate's career plan offers an excellent opportunity to combine her previous training in oncology nursing and community social work with her academic preparation in health service research and behavioral science.  The revised research plan has been greatly simplified and is designed to build upon an NIH-funded longitudinal study of symptoms in patients with advanced lung cancer (Principal Investigator, CS Cleeland, PhD).  The study includes underserved minority and non-minority patients who will receive treatment in an inner city county hospital.  This is an excellent opportunity to study the caregivers of ethnic minorities, who, because of their socioeconomic status, may be highly stressed or overwhelmed compared to other caregivers of cancer patients.       This application integrates mentoring, training, and focused research to meet 3 objectives: a) to become an established investigator in the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches in cancer control and behavioral science; 2) to use these multi-methods approaches to study the problems of caregivers and the patients they care for; and 3) to evaluate the effects of sociocultural factors on the caregiver's experience. Dr. Palos' exceptional mentor team consists of Charles S. Cleeland, PhD, Richard Payne, MD., Marjorie Kagawa-Singer, PhD, and Amalie Ramirez, PhD.  Dr. Cleeland will provide mentorship in research related to measurement of symptoms.  Dr. Payne, world-renown for his work in disparities and pain management will provide mentorship in these areas.  Dr. Singer will be a mentor in the conceptualization and measurement of culture and ethnicity.  Dr. Ramirez will mentor the candidate in developing culturally competent cancer communication for future caregiver interventions.  Formal agreements and specific roles of the mentoring team have been documented and included.  The research training will take place at MD Anderson Cancer Center/Lyndon Baines Hospital, and to a lesser extent at University of California (Dr. Kagawa-Singer), Hispanic Center of Excellence - San Antonio (Dr. Amelie G. Ramirez), and Duke University -Durham, NC (Dr. Payne).       Research examining the negative outcomes in underserved minority caregivers, such as depression, stress, anxiety, pain, fatigue, or sleep disturbances, would help advance our understanding of these problems.  This project has a longitudinal, descriptive design to evaluate these areas.  The specific aims will be to (1) describe the meaning of the experience of being a minority (African-American or Latino) and non-minority person caring for a patient with advanced lung cancer; (2) describe and compare the experiences of minority and non-minority caregivers including the prevalence and severity of physical/psychological symptoms and their influence on caregiver symptom burden; and (3) assess the relationship between caregiver's symptoms (physical and psychological) and patient's symptom's at multiple time points over the course of the patient's treatment.  The findings from this project will provide information from a sociocultural perspective that can be used to develop culturally competent interventions that can help reduce caregiver burden and improve their health outcomes.             ",Effects of Cancer Symptoms on Minority Caregivers,7232419,K07CA102482,"['Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Oncologic Nursing ', ' oncology nursing ', ' Oncological Nursing ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Oncology Nurse ', ' inner city ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' Agreement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' medically underserved ', ' chemotherapy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2007,103016,0.01424379388476827
"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative R01 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to increased antipsychotic use in African-Americans. The final objective is to determine whether Latinos are at risk for similar problems in diagnostic assessments and treatment assignment.

"InhibinB as a Marker for Premenstrual Dysphoric Symptoms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the proposed research is to find the causes of severe premenstrual mood and behavior changes, facilitate diagnosis, and speed effective treatment to women seeking help for related disorders. For decades scientists have worked to identify characteristics of the ovarian axis that are associated with premenstrual disorders. Now, results from state-of-the-art endocrine research, the body of knowledge about premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and our pilot study converge to suggest that inhibin B, a new marker of ovarian function, may be a biomarker of PMDD. The Specific Aims are to explore (1) the relationship of inhibin B and PMDD; and (2) to determine whether inhibin B differentiates women with and without PMDD after potential confounders are taken into account (the Aberrant Inhibin B Model). Hypotheses will be examined in a sample of 18 to 53-year-old Hispanic, Black, or White menstruating women with or without PMDD (N = 102). To diagnose PMDD according to DSM criteria, participants will rate symptoms and functioning daily for two menstrual cycles, and complete physical and psychiatric evaluations. In each cycle, participants will give blood samples every 3 days after the onset of menstruation until ovulation occurs as determined by home urinary luteinizing hormone test kits. Inhibin B levels will be measured in serum using ELISA. If inhibin B is a marker of PMDD, this may provide clues to the mechanisms of the disorder, premenstrual exacerbations of other conditions, and emotional reactivity in general. Laboratory studies of inhibin B already have been translated into practice aiding diagnosis of various reproductive conditions. Results of this and subsequent studies may facilitate diagnosis of PMDD. New medications targeting endocrine risk factors for premenstrual disorders ultimately may be discovered. The medications may be more efficacious, and more acceptable to women not wanting antidepressants. Data from minorities and perimenopausal women should help scientists address health disparities. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is one of the most common conditions affecting reproductive age women having a high impact on personal well-being and professional productivity. This study explores the relationship of inhibin B, a new marker of ovarian function, and PMDD. Results are expected to provide clues to the cause of PMDD, facilitate the now burdensome diagnostic process, and lead to new treatments.           ",InhibinB as a Marker for Premenstrual Dysphoric Symptoms,7232463,R21MH074914,"['Depressive disorder ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Finding by Cause ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Reproductive Endocrinology ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Seminal ', ' Validation ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' urinary ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' proliferative phase Menstrual cycle ', ' Preovulatory Phase ', ' Menstrual Proliferative Phase ', ' Follicular Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Follicular Phase ', ' Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Aging ', ' Procedures ', ' Head ', ' Heart ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hospitals ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Ovarian ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Illinois ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Infant ', ' Infertility ', ' unable to bear children ', ' infertile ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' inhibin ', ' Inhibin Hormone ', ' Folliculostatin ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' teacher ', ' Laboratories ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Luteinizing Hormone ', ' Therapeutic LH ', ' Recombinant Luteinizing Hormone ', ' Pituitary Lutenizing Hormone ', ' Lutropin ', ' Leuteinizing Hormone ', ' Interstitial Cell-Stimulating Hormone ', ' Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone ', ' Numbers ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', "" American Nurses' Association "", ' Medicine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Menstruation ', ' monthly period ', ' menstrual period ', ' Menses ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Letters ', ' news ', ' Ovulation ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Personality ', ' Genetic ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Productivity ', ' cooking ', ' tool ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Condition ', ' Figs -

"Physical Activity in relation to Depressive Symptoms in Black U.S Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    A report of the Surgeon General revealed Blacks are underrepresented in mental health research (USDHHS, 2001). The long-term objectives are to establish effective self-management tools for depressive symptoms in the Black population. The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the relation between physical activity (PA) and depressive symptoms in Black U.S. adults by performing a secondary data analysis on the National Survey of American Life (NSAL). The NSAL comprises a nationally representative sample and is one of the most comprehensive and detailed studies of depressive symptoms among Americans of African descent ever completed. The sample includes African-Americans (N=3,570) and the first ever national probability study of Blacks of Caribbean descent (N=1,623). The NSAL is one of three current national surveys comprising the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Studies funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Neighbors, one of the project investigators, is the co-sponsor for this proposed study. Bronfenbrenner's Social Ecology Model is the guiding theory with focal concepts from Pender's Health Promotion Model, specifically personal factors and situational influences. The three specific aims include 1) testing the relationship of PA with depressive symptoms, 2) examing the effects of each separate personal factor (biological, psychological, sociocultural and physical) and situational influence (environmental risk factors for seasonal affective disorder) on the relationship of PA with depressive symptoms, and 3) examining the effects of combined additional personal factors and situational influences on the relationship of PA with depressive symptoms. This proposed study is one of the first to address PA in relation to depressive symptoms in Black U.S. adults from a theoretical framework which includes the sociocultural context as recommended by a supplement to the Surgeon General's Mental Health Report. This study is an initial step in building a community-based mental health service system that is culturally relevant, responsive, and accessible to Black U.S. adults. The importance of providing culturally appropriate self-management tools in Black U.S. adults is recognized in HealthyPeople 2010. Specific objectives include developing an operational mental health plan that addresses cultural competence and providing early detection and intervention for mental health problems. In addition, this study addresses NINR's goals of promoting health, preventing disease and improving quality of life with self-management of symptoms.             ",Physical Activity in relation to Depressive Symptoms in Black U.S Adults,7409475,F31NR010669,"['African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' World Health Organization ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Seasonal Affective Disorder ', ' seasonal depression ', ' Seasonal Mood Disorder ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family member ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Communities ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cultural Characteristics ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Numbers ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Immigrant ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2007,24401,0.014418124503772342
"Race, Psychiatric Disorders, and Headache DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests five years of support for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for a new minority investigator. The objectives of the planned training program are two-fold. The first objective is to provide the minority candidate with contemporary training in the areas of statistics, research methodology, research ethics, the pathophysiology of headache disorders, cross-cultural psychology, and health disparities. Formal coursework in these areas will facilitate the successful conduct of the planned study and prepare the candidate for future research endeavors throughout her career. The second objective is to examine how race and psychiatric co-morbid conditions are related to headache severity, quality of life, treatment adherence, and ability to respond favorably to treatments in people with episodic migraines, chronic migraines, episodic tension-type headaches, chronic tension-type headaches, substance abuse headaches, or cluster headaches. Using a quasi-experimental prospective research design, 400 patients presenting at outpatient medical centers in four urban areas of Ohio (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Toledo) will complete self-administered assessments, telephone-based interviews, and daily headache diaries that elicit data on headache severity, quality of life, social support, treatment self-efficacy, locus of control, treatment adherence, and treatment outcome. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; Bandura, 1986), the planned study will employ structural equation modeling path analysis to determine whether SCT constructs, such as social support, health-related locus of control, and treatment self-efficacy, mediate associations between race and the presence of a co-morbid psychiatric disorder and key outcome measures, such as quality of life and treatment outcome. If successful, the candidate will obtain extramural funding prior to the completion of the training program that will enable her to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate a culturally-contextualized intervention to reduce headache pain and improve the life quality of people who experience severe headache characteristics.

"Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Comprehensive hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) received their first federal funding from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration in 1975. Regional networks developed enabling and strengthening intra- and inter-state cooperation and collaboration. In 1995, the CDC provided direct funding to the twelve hemophilia regions following a Congressional mandate to monitor blood product safety and hemophilia disease progression, including arthropathy. During the past ten years funds from the Hematologic Disease Branch has assisted Region X (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington) with building center and regional infrastructure including expanded data collection capabilities for surveillance. Funds have also enhanced inter-regional collaboration in the US West. The Universal Data and Serum Specimen collection System for Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders has been enrolling participants since 1997/98 and has provided a robust data bank. During the next five years, Region X in collaboration with other federal regions will begin more focused public health research with the hemophilia and bleeding disorders community that may be extrapolated to other populations with chronic conditions and diagnoses. Region X is an area of the United States with urban, rural and frontier counties. The majority of the population in this region lives north of the 45th parallel. The region also has an incidence of obesity and overweight in hemophilia patients and the general region that mirrors the national averages. The Region X research interests include: 1) whether the health disparities experienced by rural and frontier citizens also extends to persons with bleeding disorders or does care for a bleeding disorder provided by HTCs decrease the health disparities; 2) whether persons living in counties without physicians and/or hospitals have poorer physical and health outcomes compared to others with similar diagnosis, especially persons with milder severity; 3) the impact of less ambient vitamin D on joint disease and bone health/density; and 4) the relationship between perceived ability to engage in activity, actual level of activity, unemployment due to disability, pain and quality of life.          ",Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs,7279192,U01DD000200,[''],NCBDDD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,267382,0.0226254381967386
"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Region IV South Bleeding Disorders Program is a network of nine federally funded Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs) that provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The Regional Core Center (RCC) office is located in Atlanta, Georgia and shares an office with Hemophilia of Georgia, Inc. The RCC emphasizes a pro-active orientation toward bleeding disorder care. This program will further the mission of the CDC in promoting heath and quality of life in persons with bleeding disorders by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability. The goals and objectives of this regional program were designed to reduce the complications and morbidity associated with bleeding disorders, as well as to promote access to integrated and family-centered services for individuals with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Comprehensive systems of care are necessary, as those receiving care outside of an HTC have a 60% higher mortality rate than those receiving care in federally funded HTCs (CDC). Objectives will focus on those patients from traditionally underserved populations. Prevention programs will strive to reduce the impact on the public health system by, for example, decreasing the number of days missed from work and school. The RCC will be responsible for program evaluation and monitoring through required affiliate reporting, data reports, assessment of Universal Data Collection (UDC) Project participation, site visits, needs assessments, and consumer input. Other specific project objectives include: (1) provide continuous screening for HIV and Hepatitis A, B, and C; (2) facilitate improved regional information management systems, data collection and evaluation; (3) expand the UDC cohort through recruitment of individuals with genetic bleeding disorders; (4) transition the national database to a web-based application; (5) expand the database with additional relevant date related to women's issues and other important clinical outcomes; and (6) address areas of concern unique to Region IV South regarding healthcare disparities. This hemophilia care program strives to improve the quality and years of healthy lives for those living with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Prevention and outreach efforts aimed at the traditionally underserved will eliminate the region's health disparities by providing quality healthcare services, regardless of an individual's race, ethnicity, age, or gender. Particular attention will be paid to the leading health indicators: physical activity, overweight and obesity, immunization and access to health care.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers,7279184,U01DD000201,[''],NCBDDD,"HEMOPHILIA OF GEORGIA, INC.",U01,2007,450525,0.06722330882950252
"FACTORS AFFECTING OCD AND HEALTH DISPARITIES AT THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or trastorno obsesivo compulsivo (TOC) as it is known in Spanish-speaking countries, ranks tenth in the World Bank's and World Health Organization's leading causes of disability for persons age five and older. Yet there is a dearth of information on the relationship between culture, ethnicity and OCD, particularly for Hispanic persons with this disorder. The overall objective of this R03 application is to describe, examine and explore issues involving the cultural identification, symptomatology, health concerns, coping mechanisms, and quality of life of persons with OCD in a population at high risk for health disparities, Mexican-American and Mexican persons (MAs and MXs) living in the U.S.-Mexico Border region of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The specific aims of the study include: 1) to describe the cultural identification, symptomatology, health concerns, coping mechanisms, and quality of life issues among Mexican Americans and Mexicans with OCD in the Border region; 2) to compare the relationship between Mexican Americans and Mexican's health concerns, coping mechanisms, quality of life issues and other key research measures (e.g., symptom severity, cultural identification, ethnicity, education and other demographic data); and 3) to explore the implications of these findings in terms of specific, culturally sensitive interventions most likely to be effective in Mexican Americans and Mexican's' real-life situations. This study employs a mixed method approach for understanding the multiple factors affecting OCD and health disparities at the Border. Four tools validated for English- and Spanish-speaking persons will be employed to obtain qualitative and quantitative data and to meet each of the study aims. The qualitative data will provide in-depth information related to treatment and care experiences, coping mechanisms, relationships, and the possible influence of culture, ethnicity and place. The quantitative data will provide demographic information and measures of symptom severity and quality of life. Triangulation of these combined data sets will offer the greatest insight into the complex topic of investigation, thus laying the groundwork for a later, larger-scale study to examine the effects of culturally sensitive interventions to decrease health disparities for MAs and MXs with OCD. Relevance to public health. The widespread and devastating nature of OCD sharply contrasts with the paucity of research involving MAs and MXs who suffer from this condition. This application addresses this knowledge gap with a study which could provide a critical foundation for later research to examine the effects of culturally sensitive interventions to decrease health disparities on a wider scale. As such, this research can provide an important contribution to issues of health disparity.           ",FACTORS AFFECTING OCD AND HEALTH DISPARITIES AT THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER,7268968,R03NR009974,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Depth ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Interview ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexico ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' tool ', ' Psychiatric Nursing ', ' Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing ', ' Mental Health Nursing ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Texas ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' World Bank ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Church ', ' Nurse Psychotherapist ', ' Psychiatric Nurse ', ' Mental Health Nurse ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', "" Nurse's Role "", ' Structure ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R03,2007,71854,0.02792048285050291
"Beneath the Urologic Iceberg: A Qualitative Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The metaphor of an ""illness iceberg"" (Last, 1963; 2001) is employed in recognition of the fact that, while common, some clinically important symptoms never make it to the health care system for effective treatment. Many symptoms are: (a) recognized by individuals, presented for treatment, diagnosed, treated and eventually recorded as a case. Others, however, are: (b) recognized, presented, but not diagnosed, treated, or counted; some symptoms are (c) recognized by individuals but not presented (possibly receiving self care); while others (d) are not recognized and never presented, treated or counted. Building on the epidemiologic findings from the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) survey (DK56842), this qualitative research is designed to explore the submerged areas of urologic disease, in order to understand reported disparities in help-seeking for a specific constellation of symptoms (Urinary Incontinence, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome), by race/ethnicity, gender, age and SES. BACH is revealing how different sociocultural groups respond to these urologic symptoms; this complementary qualitative research is designed to explain why. BACH subjects (already identified) will be randomly selected to fill specific design cells. Established qualitative techniques will be employed by experienced investigators to elicit information on values, beliefs, norms, attributions, barriers and the perceived stigma associated with urologic symptoms. Several features are designed to overcome perceived limitations of qualitative research (representativeness, external validity and replicability). The project has high public health significance: (1) There are few in-depth studies of the ""urologic iceberg"" being uncovered by the BACH study; (2) It represents a practical and focused approach to an emerging area of health disparities; (3) It highlights a flaw in reported urologic disease rates (only those presenting get counted); and (4) Better understanding of help-seeking can improve the everyday clinical management of disease.         ",Beneath the Urologic Iceberg: A Qualitative Study,7413588,R01DK073835,"['Decision Making ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Iceberg ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' End Point ', ' Caring ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Range ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' painful bladder syndrome ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' urologic ', ' urological ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' Literature ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Respondent ', ' Interstitial Cystitis ', ' Metaphor ', ' Patients ', ' Daily ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Urologic Diseases ', ' urinary tract disorder ', ' Urological Disorders ', ' Urological Diseases ', ' Urologic Disorder ', ' Urinary Tract Diseases ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Class ', ' Belief ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Services ', ' lower urinary tract symptoms ', ' experience ', ' independency ', ' care seeking ', ' Boston ', ' Study Subject ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Count ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Conceptions ', ' ']",NIDDK,"NEW ENGLAND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R01,2008,383222,0.08525804851362123
"First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cannabis use in adolescence and young adulthood is very common in the United States. Accumulating evidence suggests that, unlike other illicit drugs, cannabis used in adolescence may be a causal risk factor for schizophrenia, and cannabis use affects the symptoms, course, and outcomes of the illness. The proposed research seeks to clarify the impact of cannabis use on the age at onset of prodromal symptoms (e.g., decline in functioning, difficulties concentrating, irritability, and sleep disturbances that precede psychosis), the age at onset of psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucinations and delusions), and the nature of negative, cognitive, neurological, and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The study also will determine whether or not a previously characterized gene-environment interaction} involving the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and pre-onset cannabis use} influences onset ages and symptomatology. The study involves hospitalized patients with a first episode of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, most of whom are African American. This population is of particular relevance given well-recognized ongoing healthcare disparities across ethnic groups, under-representation of African Americans in clinical research, underuse of mental health services by African Americans, and very high rates of cannabis use in this population. The specific aims of the research are: (1) to clarify the effects of cannabis use on disease onset by studying (a) age at onset of prodromal symptoms and (b) age at onset of psychotic symptoms in first-episode patients who used cannabis in the years prior to onset as well as those who did not; (2) to study the impact of cannabis use on disease phenomenology (i.e., symptoms, cognitive deficits, neurological signs) by comparing the clinical characteristics of first-episode patients who used cannabis prior to hospitalization with those who did not; and (3) to elucidate the impact of a specific gene-environment interaction on disease onset and disease phenomenology by investigating the effects of the COMT Val158Met functional polymorphism genotype, cannabis use, and their interaction on onset ages and symptom profiles of first-episode patients. The research will be conducted using extensive cross-sectional assessments of hospitalized first-episode patients whose data will be supplemented by information from family members/informants. Thorough and psychometrically sound instruments will be used to retrospectively assess past substance use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because schizophrenia can be such a devastating illness, efforts to better understand modifiable determinants of course and outcomes are crucial. Innovative aspects of this research that make it especially relevant and innovative include: (1) testing of focused hypotheses will be tested related to a specific recently discovered gene-environment interaction, (2) reliance on a predominantly African American sample, a group that is under- represented in psychiatric research despite a high prevalence of key risk factors, (3) the preventive implications related to future potential enhancements of outcomes by reducing cannabis use among adolescents who are at especially high risk, (4) measurement of all past use of all substances thoroughly and carefully, allowing for examination of potential interactions among the key variables being studied, and (5) the use of Ancestry-Informative Markers in the genetic analysis to control for potential effects of admixture and population stratification.          ",First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use,7463053,R01MH081011,"['Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Reliance ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' instrument ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophreniform Disorder ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory ', ' Pattern ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' Catechol O-Methyltransferase ', ' EC 2.1.1.6 ', ' Catechol Methyltransferase ', ' valylvaline ', ' Val-Val ', ' L-valyl-L-valine ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Cannabis ', ' Hemp Plant ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' Hallucinations ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Measurement ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Delusions ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Methyltransferase Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Otherwise Specified ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,295392,0.06097426936024205
"Pilot Testing a Peer-based Intervention for Symptom Management-HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this training grant application (F31) is to provide the predoctoral support to allow the investigator to test a peer-based, behavior change intervention to help women living with HIV disease control general, psychosocial and gynecological symptoms. Specifically, the applicant wants to determine if the proposed peer-based intervention for Symptom Management (PRISM-HIV) program reduces symptom intensity, increases perceived self-efficacy and increases quality of life in HIV positive women. Theory: The theoretical frameworks that will guide the development and peer based implementation of the intervention are Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Theory of Participatory Education. Methods: The study design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 124 women living with HIV disease will be randomized into one of two conditions following two baseline measurements. The two conditions are the experimental condition which will receive the peer-based intervention focusing on HIV symptom management and the control condition which will receive usual care for the six months. Analysis: The data will be analyzed by separate, repeated measures analysis of variance. We will explore the potential differences in the dependent variables (symptom intensity, perceived self-efficacy and the quality of life) at the conclusion of the study. These analyses will allow the student investigator to answer the main question of the study, i.e. the feasibility and effectiveness of the peer-led symptom management intervention. Significance: There is an increase in the number of women living with HIV disease in the United States. As the burden of HIV disease among U.S women increases, the need for community based, and chronic care interventions becomes more imperative to the health of those living with HIV and the communities in which they live. The proposed intervention would help to meet this need. Relevance to NIH goals: This application meets the goals of the National Institutes of Health in the following ways. It allows the applicant to apply current biobehavioral knowledge to a new research area, chronic symptom management in women living with HIV; it will provide new information on our ability to prevent disease by providing information on preventing HIV transmission and HIV-related diseases; it expands our knowledge on a community-based intervention that has the potential to decrease economic burden of HIV diseases in the Unites States; and it will be conducted in a responsible manner that promotes scientific integrity, public accountability and social responsibility in the conduct of science.           ",Pilot Testing a Peer-based Intervention for Symptom Management-HIV,7483205,F31NR009910,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Prohibit ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Social Accountability ', ' Social Responsibility ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Today ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Self Management ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Chronic Care ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2008,28047,0.08525358219764013
"Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to prevent the complications of hemophilia and bleeding disorders through the expansion and acquisition of clinical data sets. These data sets will include both disease-specific and general-health related information. The data acquired will be used for proactive implementation of prevention programs throughout the network of multidisciplinary comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) throughout the United States. HTC's are designed to treat patients with hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand Disease and rare factor deficiencies. Utilizing the comprehensive care model, therapeutic interventions based on previously collected data and changes in therapy based on new research continues to enhance the care of the bleeding disorders community. Chronic genetic disorders often require complex and multidisciplinary care for optimal diagnosis, treatment and management. The consequences of bleeding disorders include severe medical, financial, vocational, psychological and familial repercussions when the condition is not properly managed. The lack of proper treatment has general public health consequences such as increased costs of care caused by increased hospital and emergency utilization and patient disability that may require welfare and other government entitlements. A regional approach to planning, coordination and allocation of funds is vital to ensure that services are available to treat this and other complicated bleeding disorders in Region II, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The proposed program will continue a national network of federally funded HTCs organized through 12 regional core centers and funded by the CDC. Aim 1: To provide comprehensive prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders directed at attaining and measuring specific outcomes through research and surveillance aimed at reducing complications using a multidisciplinary approach. Under this aim we propose to expand the cohort through continued recruitment and observation individuals with genetic bleeding disorders including hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand disease, rare bleeding disorders and women with bleeding disorders; and expand the current Universal Data and Serum Specimen Collection System (UDC) database to collect additional relevant data related to women's issues in coagulation, rare bleeding disorders, prophylaxis, factor utilization, inhibitors, genetic mutations, and other important clinical outcomes. We plan to design and pilot additional studies aimed at further characterizing the bleeding disorders population through the expanded access to a) gene-based diagnosis and b) more precise definition of the biochemical phenotype (e.g. global assays) with the ultimate goal of genotype - phenotype correlation; utilize the UDC BMI data to evaluate the cost impact on the health care system from conditions with weight-based dosing; test interventions that could facilitate weight loss; and design and pilot a study to evaluate effects of rising annual out- of-pocket expenses and co-payments on the use of elective/preventive services provided by the HTC. Aim 2: Maintain A Regional Network Of Comprehensive Prevention Services Through Hemophilia Treatment Centers to Persons With Hemophilia and Related Disorders Including Women, Minorities and the Underserved. Under this broad aim we will lay out our comprehensive, culturally sensitive, family-centered care services and their expansion, our communication within the region and administrative mechanisms. These include outreach and education, orientation and training programs, maintenance of appropriate management and evaluation systems, maintenance of a prevention evaluation network to assess the efficacy of prevention services by increasing the capacity for data collection, moving from paper to electronic and our participation in the coordinating committee. Our plan as stated will promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Many of our aims will facilitate reducing health disparities and accelerate the adoption of health behaviors while improving prevention effectiveness through cost-based studies. Some aims will be directly transferable to other chronic disease populations in the general public such as the evaluation of obesity and menorrhagia.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers,7487535,U01DD000195,[''],NCBDDD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2008,706665,0.06925915048150486
"Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Comprehensive hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) received their first federal funding from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration in 1975. Regional networks developed enabling and strengthening intra- and inter-state cooperation and collaboration. In 1995, the CDC provided direct funding to the twelve hemophilia regions following a Congressional mandate to monitor blood product safety and hemophilia disease progression, including arthropathy. During the past ten years funds from the Hematologic Disease Branch has assisted Region X (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington) with building center and regional infrastructure including expanded data collection capabilities for surveillance. Funds have also enhanced inter-regional collaboration in the US West. The Universal Data and Serum Specimen collection System for Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders has been enrolling participants since 1997/98 and has provided a robust data bank. During the next five years, Region X in collaboration with other federal regions will begin more focused public health research with the hemophilia and bleeding disorders community that may be extrapolated to other populations with chronic conditions and diagnoses. Region X is an area of the United States with urban, rural and frontier counties. The majority of the population in this region lives north of the 45th parallel. The region also has an incidence of obesity and overweight in hemophilia patients and the general region that mirrors the national averages. The Region X research interests include: 1) whether the health disparities experienced by rural and frontier citizens also extends to persons with bleeding disorders or does care for a bleeding disorder provided by HTCs decrease the health disparities; 2) whether persons living in counties without physicians and/or hospitals have poorer physical and health outcomes compared to others with similar diagnosis, especially persons with milder severity; 3) the impact of less ambient vitamin D on joint disease and bone health/density; and 4) the relationship between perceived ability to engage in activity, actual level of activity, unemployment due to disability, pain and quality of life.          ",Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs,7488932,U01DD000200,[''],NCBDDD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,251339,0.0226254381967386
"A First-Line Community-Based Mindfulness Trauma Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, ""Mindfulness-Based Trauma Interventions: Healing the Whole Person"" outlines a research program for developing an Intervention Development to Services: Exploratory Research Grant (R34). Our overall goal is to address the huge mental health care disparity for low-income, minority women exposed to intimate partner violence by obtaining new knowledge and skills in order to develop and test an accessible, tailored, and culturally-appropriate mindfulness-based intervention suitable as a first-line intervention or delivery in non-mental health community settings. Mindfulness is described as ""bringing one's complete attention to the present experience on a moment- to-moment basis"" (Marlatt & Kristeller, 1999, p. 68). Mindfulness interventions have been developed to address an array of physical and mental health problems (Baer, 2003). However, none address the needs of trauma populations. The devastating effects of violence extend to both mental and physical health problems. Notably, violence has been identified as one of the ten leading health indicators in Health People 2010. PTSD is a particularly prevalent outcome of IPV, with some studies reporting more than three- quarters of battered women meeting diagnostic criteria (e.g., Jones, 2001; Kemp, et al. 1995). To narrow the remarkable mental health disparities gap, three interrelated studies using different methodologies will be conducted to develop and pilot test an adapted mindfulness-based trauma intervention. This application has three specific aims all of which are congruent with the stated mission of the NIMH R34: 1) to develop a mindfulness-based trauma intervention for PTSD and other trauma-related psychological (depression, somatic symptoms, quality of life). Intervention development will include writing intervention and training manuals, developing measures of intervention fidelity, and pre-piloting the intervention for feasibility and accountability; 2) to pilot test the interventions with low-income, predominately African-American women exposed to intimate partner violence and to examine potential mediators (mindfulness, coping self- efficacy, social support) of improved outcomes, and 3) to pilot test measures of the cost of administering the intervention. This pilot study will provide preliminary data for a rigorous large scale clinical trial to examine both self-report and biological outcomes of the mindfulness-based trauma intervention. Mindfulness is described as ""bringing one's complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis"" (Marlatt & Kristeller, 1999, p. 68). The purpose of the application, ""Mindfulness-Based Trauma Interventions: Healing the Whole Person"" is to develop and test a mindfulness-based intervention that is appropriate and suitable in community settings for women with a history of intimate partner violence and who are experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. This application has three specific aims all of which are congruent with the stated mission of the NIMH R34: 1) to develop a mindfulness-based trauma intervention for PTSD and other trauma-related psychological (depression, somatic symptoms, quality of life); 2) to pilot test the interventions with low-income, African-American women exposed to intimate partner violence, and 3) to measure the cost of administering the intervention.

"Conduct Disorder & Depression in Girls:  Precursors, Development and Comorbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive interventions depend in large part on the availability of reliable and specific information about the development of psychopathology. Three of the priority areas for clinical research identified in the 2007/2008 NIMH Strategic Plan are the 1) prediction of individuals at risk for developing disease; 2) personalization of knowledge about individual biological, environmental and social factors to better personalize interventions; and 3) participation of the diversity of people and settings in clinical research The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), a large-scale (n=2,451), longitudinal study of a representative, urban sample of African American and European American girls, is uniquely poised to illuminate each of these topic areas as they pertain to Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): two disorders that generate the greatest amount of morbidity among adolescent females and contribute the largest portion to the global burden of disease among women (Murray & Lopez. 1997). In particular, the PGS aims to predict female CD and MDD by building developmental models of risk and protection from the early identification of individual vulnerabilities that serve as childhood precursors to disorders, and the contexts in which such vulnerabilities are more likely to lead to disorder, by operationalizing sub-syndromal phenotypes of disorders, and by examining developmental changes in the pattern of comorbid conditions. Prediction will be based on multiple annual assessments of this racially and economically diverse sample with high rates of participant retention (average of 94 percent over 7 waves). Thus far, we have generated data on the onset, stability and developmental course of DSM-IV symptoms for CD and MDD and a broad range of other disorders. We also have assessed potential moderating and mediating factors on the development of symptomatology in girls. We are seeking funds to continue this prospective study through adolescence with five annual assessments of the girls and their mothers and fathers. The girls will be aged 13-16 in wave 1, and aged 17-20 years in wave 5. The planned assessments, when linked to the developmental data already collected during childhood, will elucidate precursors to CD and MDD in adolescence, their sub-syndromal phenotypes, common patterns of comorbidity, and risk, promotive and protective factors associated with transitions from precursor, to sub-syndrome, to disorder, and to comorbid disorders. The study is relevant for understanding ethnic disparities in the manifestation of CD and MDD and can serve as a building block for personalized, preventive and remedial treatments to be developed for specific subgroups of girls at risk of CD, MDD, their co-occurrence, and comorbidity with other disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood. The study also examines family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors that increase or reduce these risks. The diversity of the participants in this community sample (e.g. equal numbers of African American and European American girls, broad range of income levels) will allow information to be gathered about early and ongoing risks and problems that are more important for different subgroups, which can serve as building blocks for screening devices and the prevention of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems.           Project narrative The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood.

"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative RO1 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to increased antipsychotic use in African-Americans. The final objective is to determine whether Latinos are at risk for similar problems in diagnostic assessments and treatment assignment.

"Appraisal and Diagnostic Delay in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality have been well-documented for racial/ethnic minorities. These disparities persist despite widespread and targeted cancer education, screening campaigns, and advancements in cancer therapy. Diagnostic delay is significantly and negatively associated with cancer patient outcomes. Substantial barriers to early detection and diagnosis include lower rates of screening by minorities and access issues due to lack of health insurance. Later detection of cancer, however, is not solely explained by structural barriers to obtaining health care. Evidence has accumulated that cultural and communication factors may play a role in outcome disparities caused by late detection. We propose to examine two important factors that are likely to contribute to a delay in the diagnosis of cancer. First, `appraisal delay', defined as patients' inability to identify, interpret, and bring symptoms to the attention of their physicians. Second, 'diagnostic delay', defined as physicians' inaction or incorrect actions to make a diagnosis. We will examine how diagnostic delay may be associated with an inability to understand, interpret, and communicate effectively with patients. The overall goal of this study is to understand how these factors contribute to delay in detecting cancers in African-Americans, using colon cancer as a paradigm for this phenomenon. The study's specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Identify and examine the factors that influence appraisal delay, e.g., patients' recognition, perception, and response to pre-diagnosis cancer symptoms. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 144 recently diagnosed colon cancer patients to identify their interpretations of the symptoms that eventually result in a diagnosis of cancer. African-American and white cancer patients will be compared. Aim 2. Test whether or not primary care physicians (PCPs) communicate with patients who present pre-diagnosis symptoms of cancer to PCPs differently depending on patient race and gender. To accomplish this, we will use an experimental design to compare the communication patterns and subsequent patient management decisions of a sample of 110 PCPs who will each meet with four unannounced trained patient simulators representing 4 gender-race combinations.This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians. The study's main goal is to improve understanding of the barriers to early diagnosis of cancer, lead to interventions that can help doctors and patients communicate more effectively, and ultimately lead to earlier cancer diagnoses.      Public Health Relevance: This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians.

"Appraisal Delay and Disparities in Timely Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality have been well-documented for racial/ethnic minorities. These disparities persist despite widespread and targeted cancer education, screening campaigns, and advancements in cancer therapy. Diagnostic delay is significantly and negatively associated with cancer patient outcomes. Substantial barriers to early detection and diagnosis include lower rates of screening by minorities and access issues due to lack of health insurance. Later detection of cancer, however, is not solely explained by structural barriers to obtaining health care. Evidence has accumulated that cultural and communication factors may play a role in outcome disparities caused by late detection. Appraisal delay occurs when patients fail to recognize or interpret symptoms they are experiencing as requiring medical attention. This can ultimately result in short or lengthy delays in making a diagnosis of cancer. We posit that factors that influence the perception and interpretation of symptoms may impede an earlier cancer diagnosis in racial and ethnic minorities and that these factors may further hamper communication between physicians and patients once patients actually present symptoms to their health care provider. The goal of this study is to examine how appraisal delay impedes the reporting of symptoms to their health care providers. We also hypothesize that these patients will have more difficulty effectively communicating these symptoms to their physicians during the clinical encounter. To accomplish this goal, we will interview recently diagnosed colon cancer patients using a semi-structured interview instrument to identify their interpretations and reporting of the symptoms that were indicative of colon cancer to confidantes and their health care providers. Time to delay between patient report of symptoms to their primary care providers and diagnosis (clinical diagnostic delay) will be validated by chart review. African- American men and women and white male and female patients with newly diagnosed colon cancer will be compared. The study's specific aims are: 1) Determine if appraisal delay and clinical diagnostic delay are associated with race/ethnicity and gender and examine factors that subsequently moderate this relationship; 2) Assess the communications between patients and their health care providers about symptom reporting; and 3) Use the results of this study to clarify the need for a communication study using direct observation methods to determine whether and how the communication process between patients and primary care providers contribute to diagnostic delay by communicating differently with patients by race and gender when they present pre-diagnosis symptoms of cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project can improve understanding of the barriers to early diagnosis of cancer and lead to interventions that can help patients understand their symptoms, communicate them more effectively to their health care providers, and ultimately lead to earlier cancer diagnoses and better outcomes.          ",Appraisal Delay and Disparities in Timely Cancer Diagnosis,7499921,R01CA134280,"['Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Trust ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' Breast ', ' Structure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Colon ', ' Communication ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cognitive ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,416402,0.09156906606428594

"Home-Based Diabetes Symptom Self-Management for Mexican Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans are affected by type 2 diabetes at twice the rate of non-Hispanic Whites and they suffer higher rates of diabetes-related complications. Because Mexican Americans are more likely to lack health insurance or access to medical care, many may depend solely on self-evaluation and self-management of diabetes and its symptoms. The proposed study uses a repeated measures experimental design to determine the feasibility of delivering a culturally-specific intervention focusing on diabetes symptom self-management for Mexican Americans, examine preliminary measures of the intervention's effectiveness and costs, and assess participants' perceptions of the intervention. The proposed intervention is both standardized and tailored to participants' unique symptoms. Participants in the experimental condition will receive 8 weekly in-home 90-minute interactive one-on-one educational and behavior modification sessions with a registered nurse focusing on symptom awareness, glucose self- testing, and subsequent appropriate treatment (weeks 1   8) and 8 biweekly follow-up support telephone calls (weeks 10   24). A wait-listed control group (WLC) will serve as a comparison for the intervention group at all data points. Participants in the WLC will be offered the home-based portion of the intervention beginning in week 26. A total of 72 Mexican American adults, aged 25-75, with type 2 diabetes will participate in the study (36 in each group).  The feasibility and costs of conducting the home-based intervention will be evaluated using process evaluation and basic cost analyses. Data to assess the effects of the intervention (including symptom- related knowledge, glucometer use, physiologic indicators of health: glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, weight, lipids, confidence in diabetes self-management, and quality of life) will be collected from participants in both intervention and WLC groups at three points: baseline (week 0), immediately post- intervention (week 9), and 120 days post-intervention (week 25) to examine long-term effects of the intervention on A1c levels. Intervention participants' perceptions about the intervention will be evaluated using focus groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study provides an essential public health service by pilot testing a symptom-focused, culturally meaningful, diabetes self-management program aimed at reducing barriers to lifestyle modification, increasing health literacy, improving diabetes control and quality of life, and relieving the physical, societal, and economic burdens of Mexican Americans' worsening diabetes prevalence and consequences.          ",Home-Based Diabetes Symptom Self-Management for Mexican Americans,7471271,R21DK076705,"['American ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"Center for Reducing Risks in Vulnerable Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall purpose of the Center for Reducing Risks in Vulnerable Populations (CRRVP) is to (a) advance the science of bio-behavioral health for vulnerable populations, emphasizing issues associated with vulnerability related age (very young and elderly),   minority status, and lower socioeconomic status; (b) reduce disparities in disease/illness; and (c) support research training by providing core services and resources to investigators. The work of the CRRVP will be accomplished through three research cores (a) Multi-ethnic Emphasis Core, (b) Bio-behavioral Methods Core and (c) Development and Dissemination Core. The CRRVP will sponsor research to advance the science in bio-behavioral health for vulnerable populations and in the year four novice investigators will be funded to conduct pilot studies. The science of the CRRVP is organized by a bio-behavioral and health-related quality of life framework. Key elements in this framework include person (individual) factors, environmental factors, physiological and psychological variables, symptom status, functional status, general health perception, and quality of life. Studies supported by the CRRVP will (a) reduce disparity and promote healthy life styles for vulnerable populations, (b) elucidate underlying physiological and psychological mechanisms that contribute to symptoms, functional status, perceived health status and quality of life, (c) test interventions to minimize symptoms, enhance functional status, perceived health status and quality of life. The research supported by the CRRVP will have a strong bio-behavioral orientation with an emphasis on potential/real health problems experienced by people who are very young, elderly, minorities and/or lower socioeconomic status. In addition, the CRRVP will have a strong emphasis on facilitating multi-ethnic research and reducing disparity in health through research. The combining of research related to vulnerable populations under the umbrella of a single center is a strength to overlaps in the science that have not been explored. The interaction of investigators with expertise in diverse groups of subjects will move the science forward in new directions.

"Parent Screeners for Bipolarity in Hispanic Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with Early-Onset Bipolar Disorder (EOBD) present with symptoms that can be confused with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). One of the biggest challenges faced by clinicians is differentiating between children with EOBD and those with ADHD. The consequences of falsely diagnosing children with EOBD can lead to inappropriate or harmful intervention. Additionally, failing to identify and treat EOBD children can lead to recurrent mood episodes, and more severe symptoms. At present, there are no validated screening tools or assessment aids for use in Spanish-speaking families, nor is it known whether   existing measures could be used in English speaking Hispanic families without clinically meaningful bias. A review of the literature indicates that to date no studies have been conducted on a sample of primarily Hispanic children (Youngstrom, Findling, Youngstrom, & Calabrese, 2005). There are important cultural reasons that the performance of parent-reported instruments might be different in a Hispanic population, such as the primacy of family in the lives of its members (referred to as ""familism"" in ethnographic studies). This study will evaluate the extent to which acculturation variables moderate the value or accuracy of information obtained from four different screening instruments for diagnosing EOBD in a group of Hispanic children. In addition to the usual value of validating measures in a new population, we will be using a conceptual framework that examines if familism and attributions about mental illness impact diagnostic accuracy in Hispanics. Data will be collected on a case series of 40 children diagnosed with EOBD and a sample of 40 children that have not been diagnosed with EOBD. The two groups of children will be compared to determine whether parental instruments aid in accurately differentiating children diagnosed with EOBD from non EOBD children. The long term objectives are to evaluate the psychometrics of all the mood rating scales in larger samples of English and Spanish-speaking Hispanic participants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the rapid increase in the size of the Hispanic population and the rate of EOBD diagnosis, the development and testing of assessment tools for these families is of crucial public health importance. The proposed study is directly relevant to the Healthy People 2010 (originally Health People 2000) initiative of NIH (November,   2000), which has made the elimination of health disparities a national priority (see www. healthypeople.gov). Results of this study will improve the ability to diagnose and treat EOBD children in this underrepresented and underserved population.             ",Parent Screeners for Bipolarity in Hispanic Children,7487578,F31MH078294,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Symptoms ', ' Case Series ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' early onset ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Moods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Review Literature ', ' Parents ', ' tool ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Psychometrics ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' instrument ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' size ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Illness impact ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIMH,CARLOS ALBIZU UNIVERSITY,F31,2008,30812,0.049484553943305615
"A Multiethnic Internet Study on Menopausal Symptoms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing ethnic diversity of the U.S. population requires health professionals to practice with greater cultural competence in areas such as the management of menopausal symptoms, where cultural beliefs mediate the biology of reproduction and aging. A growing number of studies have challenged the universality of menopausal symptoms by indicating significant ethnic differences in how women experience them. However, few investigators have studied ethnic populations in the U.S., and few studies have been national in scope. With advances in computer technologies, the Internet now provides an excellent medium of national and international communication and allows people in different geographical areas to communicate and exchange their experiences and opinions. The proposed study uses innovative Internet data collection methods to collect national data and essential information about specific ethnic differences in menopausal symptom experience while respecting women's own experiences. The specific aims are to: a) explore ethnic differences in menopausal symptom experience reported by 4 of the most common ethnic groups of women across the U.S. (Hispanic, non-Hispanic (N-H) White, N-H African American, and N-H Asian); and b) explore the ethnic-specific contexts of women's daily lives that influence women's self-reported menopausal symptom experience. A feminist approach will guide the research process. Innovative data collection methods will be used, including an Internet survey among 500 middle-aged women recruited using the quota sampling method with multiple recruitment strategies through various Internet settings, and online forums of 6-month duration among 4 different ethnic groups (30 members per group) recruited from among the Internet survey participants. Long-term goals are to: a) contribute to recognition of women's own menopausal symptom experience so that health care can be planned and provided from women's own views and perspectives; b) develop decision support systems for menopausal symptom management that can be validated across diverse practice settings; and c) eliminate ethnic biases and inequity in menopausal symptom management and promote culturally competent care for menopausal women.

"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African-Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African-American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative R01 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African- Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to increased antipsychotic use in African-Americans. The final objective is to determine whether Latinos are at risk for similar problems in diagnostic assessments and treatment assignment.

"Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing renewal application seeks to extend our previous work among patients with end stage lung disease to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, enhanced coping skills training (CST) protocol for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is an obstructive airway disease marked by symptoms of dyspnea, paroxysmal coughing, pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Approximately 12.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD and 70 percent of these cases represent individuals under the age of 65. COPD patients who are at an early stage of their disease often experience a progressive worsening of symptoms, while the advanced stages of the disease may be marked by frequent visits to the emergency department or inpatient hospitalizations for acute COPD exacerbations. Importantly, COPD also is a fatal condition for many patients, and is the fourth leading cause of preventable death for both men and women in the United States, with over 120,000 deaths reported in 2002. Although COPD is preventable (i.e., by not smoking), there is no cure for the disease and therefore the symptoms must be managed effectively. It has been well-established that brief, focused cognitive-behavioral therapy can significantly improve psychological function in medically ill persons, the wide geographic distribution of patients with COPD, along with their chronic exacerbations of illness, make face-to-face delivery of such therapy extremely difficult. Our previous work demonstrated that a telephone-based coping skills intervention (CST) with patients awaiting lung transplantation was effective in improving quality of life but did not improve physical functioning or survival. In that study, patients with COPD at an earlier stage of their disease process appeared to benefit most from CST. Thus, the present application proposes a larger, dual-site (Duke and Ohio State University), randomized trial among patients with COPD, using a comprehensive set of outcome measures over an extended follow-up period. Six hundred COPD patients will be randomly assigned to either a telephone-based enhanced, caregiver-assisted CST intervention or to a Usual care plus education and symptom monitoring Control group. Patients and their self-identified caregivers will undergo comprehensive assessments of physical and psychosocial functioning before and after a 16-week intervention. The study will examine the short- and longer- term impact of CST on psychological distress and quality of life as well as the effects of the intervention on morbidity, mortality, and medical costs over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop more effective ways to help patients with chronic lung disease and their caregivers cope more effectively with problematic symptoms, reduce distress, improve quality of life, enhance physical functioning, and increase survival.      Public Health Relevance: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant health problem in the United States and throughout the world, and is considered the fourth leading cause of death in the US. This study will examine the effects of an enhanced coping skills training program for COPD patients and their caregivers, delivered by telephone, on patients' psychosocial and physical functioning and long-term survival.          ",Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD,7461961,R01HL065503,"['Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Inpatients ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' Inequality ', ' Early Intervention (Education) ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Moods ', ' Morbidity -

"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Region IV South Bleeding Disorders Program is a network of nine federally funded Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs) that provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The Regional Core Center (RCC) office is located in Atlanta, Georgia and shares an office with Hemophilia of Georgia, Inc. The RCC emphasizes a pro-active orientation toward bleeding disorder care. This program will further the mission of the CDC in promoting heath and quality of life in persons with bleeding disorders by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability. The goals and objectives of this regional program were designed to reduce the complications and morbidity associated with bleeding disorders, as well as to promote access to integrated and family-centered services for individuals with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Comprehensive systems of care are necessary, as those receiving care outside of an HTC have a 60% higher mortality rate than those receiving care in federally funded HTCs (CDC). Objectives will focus on those patients from traditionally underserved populations. Prevention programs will strive to reduce the impact on the public health system by, for example, decreasing the number of days missed from work and school. The RCC will be responsible for program evaluation and monitoring through required affiliate reporting, data reports, assessment of Universal Data Collection (UDC) Project participation, site visits, needs assessments, and consumer input. Other specific project objectives include: (1) provide continuous screening for HIV and Hepatitis A, B, and C; (2) facilitate improved regional information management systems, data collection and evaluation; (3) expand the UDC cohort through recruitment of individuals with genetic bleeding disorders; (4) transition the national database to a web-based application; (5) expand the database with additional relevant date related to women's issues and other important clinical outcomes; and (6) address areas of concern unique to Region IV South regarding healthcare disparities. This hemophilia care program strives to improve the quality and years of healthy lives for those living with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Prevention and outreach efforts aimed at the traditionally underserved will eliminate the region's health disparities by providing quality healthcare services, regardless of an individual's race, ethnicity, age, or gender. Particular attention will be paid to the leading health indicators: physical activity, overweight and obesity, immunization and access to health care.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers,7487541,U01DD000201,[''],NCBDDD,"HEMOPHILIA OF GEORGIA, INC.",U01,2008,400847,0.06722330882950252
"Effects of Cancer Symptoms on Minority Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career goal of Dr. Guadalupe Palos is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral science, with a focus on underserved and minority populations.  The candidate's career plan offers an excellent opportunity to combine her previous training in oncology nursing and community social work with her academic preparation in health service research and behavioral science.  The revised research plan has been greatly simplified and is designed to build upon an NIH-funded longitudinal study of symptoms in patients with advanced lung cancer (Principal Investigator, CS Cleeland, PhD).  The study includes underserved minority and non-minority patients who will receive treatment in an inner city county hospital.  This is an excellent opportunity to study the caregivers of ethnic minorities, who, because of their socioeconomic status, may be highly stressed or overwhelmed compared to other caregivers of cancer patients.       This application integrates mentoring, training, and focused research to meet 3 objectives: a) to become an established investigator in the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches in cancer control and behavioral science; 2) to use these multi-methods approaches to study the problems of caregivers and the patients they care for; and 3) to evaluate the effects of sociocultural factors on the caregiver's experience. Dr. Palos' exceptional mentor team consists of Charles S. Cleeland, PhD, Richard Payne, MD., Marjorie Kagawa-Singer, PhD, and Amalie Ramirez, PhD.  Dr. Cleeland will provide mentorship in research related to measurement of symptoms.  Dr. Payne, world-renown for his work in disparities and pain management will provide mentorship in these areas.  Dr. Singer will be a mentor in the conceptualization and measurement of culture and ethnicity.  Dr. Ramirez will mentor the candidate in developing culturally competent cancer communication for future caregiver interventions.  Formal agreements and specific roles of the mentoring team have been documented and included.  The research training will take place at MD Anderson Cancer Center/Lyndon Baines Hospital, and to a lesser extent at University of California (Dr. Kagawa-Singer), Hispanic Center of Excellence - San Antonio (Dr. Amelie G. Ramirez), and Duke University -Durham, NC (Dr. Payne).       Research examining the negative outcomes in underserved minority caregivers, such as depression, stress, anxiety, pain, fatigue, or sleep disturbances, would help advance our understanding of these problems.  This project has a longitudinal, descriptive design to evaluate these areas.  The specific aims will be to (1) describe the meaning of the experience of being a minority (African-American or Latino) and non-minority person caring for a patient with advanced lung cancer; (2) describe and compare the experiences of minority and non-minority caregivers including the prevalence and severity of physical/psychological symptoms and their influence on caregiver symptom burden; and (3) assess the relationship between caregiver's symptoms (physical and psychological) and patient's symptom's at multiple time points over the course of the patient's treatment.  The findings from this project will provide information from a sociocultural perspective that can be used to develop culturally competent interventions that can help reduce caregiver burden and improve their health outcomes.             ",Effects of Cancer Symptoms on Minority Caregivers,7491625,K07CA102482,"['Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Oncologic Nursing ', ' oncology nursing ', ' Oncological Nursing ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Oncology Nurse ', ' inner city ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' Agreement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' medically underserved ', ' chemotherapy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2008,105135,0.01424379388476827
"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this program is to prevent complications of hemophilia and other bleeding disorders through assessment, surveillance, outreach, education, consultation, and management. A regional network of ten hemophilia treatment centers in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee will be coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. In 2005, Region IV-North (comprising nine hemophilia treatment centers [HTCs] in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee) had a total of 1,848 active patients with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. Hemophilia patients constitute 61.5% of the total patients, while 27.6% have von Willebrand disease and 10.9% have other bleeding disorders. In 2005, there were 380 active female patients, an increase of 25.2% over the 2004 total. Almost 22% of the active patients are from ethnic minority groups, with an explosive increase in Hispanics. In comparison to U.S. averages, there are higher poverty rates and lower educational levels within the region, predisposing individuals to suboptimal behaviors in relation to diet, exercise, and use of health care services. The network will collaborate with regional lay organizations and the four non-federally funded centers in the region to deliver appropriately tailored prevention messages aimed at reducing complications of bleeding disorders and improving health across the lifespan, with the intention of attaining and measuring specific outcomes to reduce complications. Further, the region will redouble its outreach to underserved populations, such as women and minorities, to integrate them into the HTC system. All of these efforts will be systematically evaluated to assess their efficacy. Surveillance of patients enrolled in the CDC's Universal Data Collection (UDC) project, which has collected samples and data from over 18,000 individuals nationally since 1998, will continue in order to monitor the safety of the blood supply. The network will also expand upon the UDC program to collect data that could be used for clinical research projects leading to improved health outcomes for individuals with bleeding disorders, accelerated adoption of healthy behaviors, the reduction or elimination of health disparities among various ethnic and racial groups and between genders, and the achievement of greater efficiency in the core public health infrastructure.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs,7487521,U01DD000199,[''],NCBDDD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2008,552048,0.04356228954973102
"Hormones/Genes in Women's Health: From Bench to Bedside DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of this BIRCWH proposal is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders, and those disorders specific to women. This application seeks support to create an integrated interdisciplinary training program that will be based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program will be modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption in this BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) will be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. This BIRCWH program will capitalize on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Scholars will be assigned a team of Mentors. In order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner, each of four Scholars will be assigned a Primary and Secondary Mentor. Primary Mentors will be in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors will be in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and will help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. A Career Mentor (senior HMS/HSPH faculty and senior administrators) will advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Finally there will be a Mentor in Health Disparities, who will expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity can be influenced by social/environmental factors. This BIRCWH proposal will focus on the following disorders, given both the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health. They include: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that this BIRCWH proposal is offering an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that will train the next generation of leaders in women's health.

"Ethnicity and the Diagnosis of Affective Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mood disorders are among the most common and debilitating conditions affecting humanity. Correctly identifying and treating mood disorders is critical in order to address this serious public health problem. However, African-Americans with mood disorders are significantly more likely than white patients to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Consequently, African-Americans are at increased risk for receiving inadequate treatment. Failure to correctly identify African-Americans with these conditions contributes to disparities in medical care delivery between ethnic minority and majority patients. However, it is not known why African-Americans with mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Previous investigators suggested that misdiagnoses of schizophrenic disorders appeared to occur because clinicians failed to elicit affective symptoms from African-Americans with mood disorders. Moreover, when mood and psychotic symptoms were both identified, clinicians appeared to minimize the affective symptoms in African-American men. These findings suggest the hypothesis that African-Americans with severe mood disorders are more likely than whites to be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia because clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of mood symptoms in the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, African- Americans are more likely to receive excess antipsychotics. Previous studies typically contrasted only African- American and white patients, so it is unknown whether this problem of misdiagnosis is unique to African-Americans or also occurs in other U.S. minorities. Although some studies reported that mood disorders were also commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in Latinos, other work disagreed. Because there are few studies of these issues in Latinos, it is difficult to identify associations among diagnosis, treatment and ethnicity in this patient group. With these considerations in mind, we propose a large, regionally diverse, six-site collaborative R01 study to examine the effects of ethnicity on clinical diagnosis and treatment assignment in African-American, Latino and white patients with mood disorders. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that clinicians over-emphasize psychotic symptoms at the expense of affective symptoms in African-Americans, leading to an excess of clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia relative to other ethnic groups. A second objective is to test the hypothesis that over-emphasis of psychotic symptoms also contributes to increased antipsychotic use in African-Americans. The final objective is to determine whether Latinos are at risk for similar problems in diagnostic assessments and treatment assignment.

"The Effect of Gonadal Steriods on Pavlovian Fear Conditioning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of anxiety and fear dysregulation are highly prevalent. It is known that these disorders affect women approximately two times more than they affect men, and this disparity is thought to be related to hormone regulation, yet the underlying mechanism of hormone regulation of the fear circuit in either sex remains unknown. The purpose of this Exploratory/ Developmental Grant proposal, in response to PA-03-169, is to develop a more informative and accurate method to determine the effect that gonadal hormones have on fear in both male and female animals. Here, we will employ a new adapted version of the discrimination training paradigm AX+.BX-, along with the use of highly specific estrogen receptor agonists and an androgen receptor-specific testosterone metabolite, to measure the effect that activation of specific gonadal steroid receptors have on both the activation and inhibition of fear. The specific aims of this project are: 1. to validate the use of the AX+, BX- discrimination learning paradigm as a model for examining hormone modulation of fear acquisition, expression and inhibition. 2. to use this model to examine: the effect of gonadal steroids on fear acquisition, and the effect of gonadal steroids on fear expression, in gonadectomized male and female rats. Data from these studies will begin to elucidate the specific effects that these steroid hormones have on very particular aspects of emotional memory formation and expression in general, and moreover, these studies will help to clarify the contribution that the various gonadal steroids make to fear learning in each individual sex . Results from these investigations would not only speak to the development, and expression of emotional learning within each individual sex, but will also begin to address the gender disparity in the occurrence of PTSD, depression and anxiety illness, and panic disorder.           ",The Effect of Gonadal Steriods on Pavlovian Fear Conditioning,7537758,R21MH076869,"['Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Stanolone ', ' Therapeutic Androstanolone ', ' Dihydrotestosterone ', ' Androstanolone ', ' Androstan-3-one, 17-hydroxy-, (5alpha,17beta)- ', ' 5-alpha-DHT ', ' 5 alpha-Dihydrotestosterone ', ' 17beta-Hydroxy-5alpha-Androstan-3-One ', ' Steroids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Androstenediol ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Reporting ', ' Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators ', ' SERMs ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' hormone regulation ', ' hormonal regulation ', ' Cognition ', ' conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination Learning ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' conditioned fear ', ' fear conditioning ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Affect ', ' Hippocampal Formation ', ' base ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Agonist ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Androstenediols ', ' delta 5-Androstene-3 beta,17 beta-Diol ', ' Hermaphrodiol ', ' Delta 5-Androstenediol ', ' Androst-5-ene-3,17-diol, (3beta,17beta)- ', ' Androst-5-ene-3,17-diol ', ' Androst-5-ene-3 beta,17 beta-Diol ', ' 5-Androstene-3beta-17beta-Diol ', ' 5-Androstene-3,17-diol ', ' steroid hormone ', ' Therapeutic Steroid Hormone ', ' Gonadal Hormones ', ' Panic Disorder ', ' panic anxiety syndrome ', ' Animals ', ' Pathology ', ' Play ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,188013,0.014265857591203334
"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Region IV South Bleeding Disorders Program is a network of nine federally funded Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs) that provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The Regional Core Center (RCC) office is located in Atlanta, Georgia and shares an office with Hemophilia of Georgia, Inc. The RCC emphasizes a pro-active orientation toward bleeding disorder care. This program will further the mission of the CDC in promoting heath and quality of life in persons with bleeding disorders by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability. The goals and objectives of this regional program were designed to reduce the complications and morbidity associated with bleeding disorders, as well as to promote access to integrated and family-centered services for individuals with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Comprehensive systems of care are necessary, as those receiving care outside of an HTC have a 60% higher mortality rate than those receiving care in federally funded HTCs (CDC). Objectives will focus on those patients from traditionally underserved populations. Prevention programs will strive to reduce the impact on the public health system by, for example, decreasing the number of days missed from work and school. The RCC will be responsible for program evaluation and monitoring through required affiliate reporting, data reports, assessment of Universal Data Collection (UDC) Project participation, site visits, needs assessments, and consumer input.

"Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Comprehensive hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) received their first federal funding from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration in 1975. Regional networks developed enabling and strengthening intra- and inter-state cooperation and collaboration. In 1995, the CDC provided direct funding to the twelve hemophilia regions following a Congressional mandate to monitor blood product safety and hemophilia disease progression, including arthropathy. During the past ten years funds from the Hematologic Disease Branch has assisted Region X (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington) with building center and regional infrastructure including expanded data collection capabilities for surveillance. Funds have also enhanced inter-regional collaboration in the US West. The Universal Data and Serum Specimen collection System for Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders has been enrolling participants since 1997/98 and has provided a robust data bank. During the next five years, Region X in collaboration with other federal regions will begin more focused public health research with the hemophilia and bleeding disorders community that may be extrapolated to other populations with chronic conditions and diagnoses. Region X is an area of the United States with urban, rural and frontier counties. The majority of the population in this region lives north of the 45th parallel. The region also has an incidence of obesity and overweight in hemophilia patients and the general region that mirrors the national averages. The Region X research interests include: 1) whether the health disparities experienced by rural and frontier citizens also extends to persons with bleeding disorders or does care for a bleeding disorder provided by HTCs decrease the health disparities; 2) whether persons living in counties without physicians and/or hospitals have poorer physical and health outcomes compared to others with similar diagnosis, especially persons with milder severity; 3) the impact of less ambient vitamin D on joint disease and bone health/density; and 4) the relationship between perceived ability to engage in activity, actual level of activity, unemployment due to disability, pain and quality of life.          ",Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs,7679722,U01DD000200,[''],NCBDDD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2009,251339,0.0226254381967386
"Harvard/Brown Anxiety Program (HARP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental health conditions in the United States. Substantial gaps exist in the literature with respect to the clinical course of anxiety disorders in particular groups of individuals who are continually increasing in prevalence in the U.S. population, particularly African American and Hispanic individuals, and individuals entering older age. Specifically, despite the increasing and substantial number of African American, Hispanic, and older adults in the population, there are no published data on the clinical course of anxiety disorders in these groups of individuals that have been collected using a prospective, short-interval interview, longitudinal, naturalistic design. In this application we propose two timely and needed studies within the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Program (HARP) to address these fundamental gaps in our understanding of the course of anxiety disorders in these understudied populations. First, we propose to expand our newly recruited and prospectively studied sample of African Americans and Hispanics with anxiety disorders to a total of 175 African Americans and 175 Hispanics, and to recruit a contemporaneous sample of 175 non-Hispanic Caucasians, comparable on socioeconomic indicators to the African American and Hispanic samples. The recruitment and prospective, short-interval follow-up of these individuals over the next 5 years will provide the first comprehensive description of the prospective naturalistic course of psychopathology and psychosocial outcomes associated with DSM-IV anxiety disorders and related culture-bound syndromes and symptoms in African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects that are comparable on socioeconomic indicators (AIM 1), as well as examination of predictors of course within each of these three ethnic groups (AIM 2). We will then conduct the first prospective longitudinal test of potential ethnic minority disparities in the course of anxiety disorders (AIM 3) along with the first examination of potential demographic, clinical, environmental stressor, and socio-cultural predictors of ethnic minority disparities in course (AIM 4). Second, we propose to continue observation of members of the original HARP cohort who have been studied for 15 years as they enter older adulthood (all 247 subjects who will reach or exceed the age of 61 during the proposed grant period) to provide new knowledge about the developmental changes that take place in the clinical course of anxiety disorders during the transition to older adulthood (AIMS 5 and 6). We will test the suggestion in the literature, based on epidemiological data, that the course of anxiety disorders improves during the transition to older adulthood; explore the extent to which indicators of declining physical and social wellness may be predictive of worsening course of anxiety disorders as subjects make the transition to older adulthood; and test the hypothesis that those individuals who have had an especially pernicious course of anxiety are at increased risk for age-related cognitive impairment. Taken together, this proposal will provide substantial new clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in understudied individuals in the population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the increasing numbers of both ethnic minorities and individuals entering older age in the United States, there is a dearth of substantial clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, including factors which place them at substantial risk for deleterious health consequences. This project will provide necessary in-depth prospective longitudinal study of the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, and holds promise for providing insight into the factors associated with the medical, psychological, and economic consequences of anxiety disorders in ethnic minorities and aging populations.           PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE (2-3 sentences) Despite the increasing numbers of both ethnic minorities and individuals entering older age in the United States, there is a dearth of substantial clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, including factors which place them at substantial risk for deleterious health consequences.

"Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing renewal application seeks to extend our previous work among patients with end stage lung disease to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, enhanced coping skills training (CST) protocol for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is an obstructive airway disease marked by symptoms of dyspnea, paroxysmal coughing, pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Approximately 12.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD and 70 percent of these cases represent individuals under the age of 65. COPD patients who are at an early stage of their disease often experience a progressive worsening of symptoms, while the advanced stages of the disease may be marked by frequent visits to the emergency department or inpatient hospitalizations for acute COPD exacerbations. Importantly, COPD also is a fatal condition for many patients, and is the fourth leading cause of preventable death for both men and women in the United States, with over 120,000 deaths reported in 2002. Although COPD is preventable (i.e., by not smoking), there is no cure for the disease and therefore the symptoms must be managed effectively. It has been well-established that brief, focused cognitive-behavioral therapy can significantly improve psychological function in medically ill persons, the wide geographic distribution of patients with COPD, along with their chronic exacerbations of illness, make face-to-face delivery of such therapy extremely difficult. Our previous work demonstrated that a telephone-based coping skills intervention (CST) with patients awaiting lung transplantation was effective in improving quality of life but did not improve physical functioning or survival. In that study, patients with COPD at an earlier stage of their disease process appeared to benefit most from CST. Thus, the present application proposes a larger, dual-site (Duke and Ohio State University), randomized trial among patients with COPD, using a comprehensive set of outcome measures over an extended follow-up period. Six hundred COPD patients will be randomly assigned to either a telephone-based enhanced, caregiver-assisted CST intervention or to a Usual care plus education and symptom monitoring Control group. Patients and their self-identified caregivers will undergo comprehensive assessments of physical and psychosocial functioning before and after a 16-week intervention. The study will examine the short- and longer- term impact of CST on psychological distress and quality of life as well as the effects of the intervention on morbidity, mortality, and medical costs over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop more effective ways to help patients with chronic lung disease and their caregivers cope more effectively with problematic symptoms, reduce distress, improve quality of life, enhance physical functioning, and increase survival.      Public Health Relevance: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant health problem in the United States and throughout the world, and is considered the fourth leading cause of death in the US. This study will examine the effects of an enhanced coping skills training program for COPD patients and their caregivers, delivered by telephone, on patients' psychosocial and physical functioning and long-term survival.          ",Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD,7646452,R01HL065503,"['Coughing ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Paroxysmal Dyspnea ', ' Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspneas ', ' Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea ', ' Paroxysmal Dyspneas ', ' Cardiac Asthma ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Inpatients ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' Inequality ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Moods ', ' Morbidity -

"Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to prevent the complications of hemophilia and bleeding disorders through the expansion and acquisition of clinical data sets. These data sets will include both disease-specific and general-health related information. The data acquired will be used for proactive implementation of prevention programs throughout the network of multidisciplinary comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) throughout the United States. HTC's are designed to treat patients with hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand Disease and rare factor deficiencies. Utilizing the comprehensive care model, therapeutic interventions based on previously collected data and changes in therapy based on new research continues to enhance the care of the bleeding disorders community. Chronic genetic disorders often require complex and multidisciplinary care for optimal diagnosis, treatment and management. The consequences of bleeding disorders include severe medical, financial, vocational, psychological and familial repercussions when the condition is not properly managed. The lack of proper treatment has general public health consequences such as increased costs of care caused by increased hospital and emergency utilization and patient disability that may require welfare and other government entitlements. A regional approach to planning, coordination and allocation of funds is vital to ensure that services are available to treat this and other complicated bleeding disorders in Region II, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The proposed program will continue a national network of federally funded HTCs organized through 12 regional core centers and funded by the CDC. Aim 1: To provide comprehensive prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders directed at attaining and measuring specific outcomes through research and surveillance aimed at reducing complications using a multidisciplinary approach. Under this aim we propose to expand the cohort through continued recruitment and observation individuals with genetic bleeding disorders including hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand disease, rare bleeding disorders and women with bleeding disorders; and expand the current Universal Data and Serum Specimen Collection System (UDC) database to collect additional relevant data related to women's issues in coagulation, rare bleeding disorders, prophylaxis, factor utilization, inhibitors, genetic mutations, and other important clinical outcomes. We plan to design and pilot additional studies aimed at further characterizing the bleeding disorders population through the expanded access to a) gene-based diagnosis and b) more precise definition of the biochemical phenotype (e.g. global assays) with the ultimate goal of genotype - phenotype correlation; utilize the UDC BMI data to evaluate the cost impact on the health care system from conditions with weight-based dosing; test interventions that could facilitate weight loss; and design and pilot a study to evaluate effects of rising annual out- of-pocket expenses and co-payments on the use of elective/preventive services provided by the HTC. Aim 2: Maintain A Regional Network Of Comprehensive Prevention Services Through Hemophilia Treatment Centers to Persons With Hemophilia and Related Disorders Including Women, Minorities and the Underserved. Under this broad aim we will lay out our comprehensive, culturally sensitive, family-centered care services and their expansion, our communication within the region and administrative mechanisms. These include outreach and education, orientation and training programs, maintenance of appropriate management and evaluation systems, maintenance of a prevention evaluation network to assess the efficacy of prevention services by increasing the capacity for data collection, moving from paper to electronic and our participation in the coordinating committee. Our plan as stated will promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Many of our aims will facilitate reducing health disparities and accelerate the adoption of health behaviors while improving prevention effectiveness through cost-based studies. Some aims will be directly transferable to other chronic disease populations in the general public such as the evaluation of obesity and menorrhagia.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers,7679708,U01DD000195,[''],NCBDDD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2009,691515,0.06925915048150486
"First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cannabis use in adolescence and young adulthood is very common in the United States. Accumulating evidence suggests that, unlike other illicit drugs, cannabis used in adolescence may be a causal risk factor for schizophrenia, and cannabis use affects the symptoms, course, and outcomes of the illness. The proposed research seeks to clarify the impact of cannabis use on the age at onset of prodromal symptoms (e.g., decline in functioning, difficulties concentrating, irritability, and sleep disturbances that precede psychosis), the age at onset of psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucinations and delusions), and the nature of negative, cognitive, neurological, and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The study also will determine whether or not a previously characterized gene-environment interaction} involving the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and pre-onset cannabis use} influences onset ages and symptomatology. The study involves hospitalized patients with a first episode of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, most of whom are African American. This population is of particular relevance given well-recognized ongoing healthcare disparities across ethnic groups, under-representation of African Americans in clinical research, underuse of mental health services by African Americans, and very high rates of cannabis use in this population. The specific aims of the research are: (1) to clarify the effects of cannabis use on disease onset by studying (a) age at onset of prodromal symptoms and (b) age at onset of psychotic symptoms in first-episode patients who used cannabis in the years prior to onset as well as those who did not; (2) to study the impact of cannabis use on disease phenomenology (i.e., symptoms, cognitive deficits, neurological signs) by comparing the clinical characteristics of first-episode patients who used cannabis prior to hospitalization with those who did not; and (3) to elucidate the impact of a specific gene-environment interaction on disease onset and disease phenomenology by investigating the effects of the COMT Val158Met functional polymorphism genotype, cannabis use, and their interaction on onset ages and symptom profiles of first-episode patients. The research will be conducted using extensive cross-sectional assessments of hospitalized first-episode patients whose data will be supplemented by information from family members/informants. Thorough and psychometrically sound instruments will be used to retrospectively assess past substance use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because schizophrenia can be such a devastating illness, efforts to better understand modifiable determinants of course and outcomes are crucial. Innovative aspects of this research that make it especially relevant and innovative include: (1) testing of focused hypotheses will be tested related to a specific recently discovered gene-environment interaction, (2) reliance on a predominantly African American sample, a group that is under- represented in psychiatric research despite a high prevalence of key risk factors, (3) the preventive implications related to future potential enhancements of outcomes by reducing cannabis use among adolescents who are at especially high risk, (4) measurement of all past use of all substances thoroughly and carefully, allowing for examination of potential interactions among the key variables being studied, and (5) the use of Ancestry-Informative Markers in the genetic analysis to control for potential effects of admixture and population stratification.          ",First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use,7683114,R01MH081011,"['Delusions ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Methyltransferase Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' informant ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' Hallucinations ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Measurement ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Reliance ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' instrument ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophreniform Disorder ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory ', ' Pattern ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' Catechol O-Methyltransferase ', ' EC 2.1.1.6 ', ' Catechol Methyltransferase ', ' valylvaline ', ' Val-Val ', ' L-valyl-L-valine ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Cannabis ', ' Hemp Plant ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 12 year old ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 14 year old ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,355530,0.06097426936024205
"Appraisal Delay and Disparities in Timely Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality have been well-documented for racial/ethnic minorities. These disparities persist despite widespread and targeted cancer education, screening campaigns, and advancements in cancer therapy. Diagnostic delay is significantly and negatively associated with cancer patient outcomes. Substantial barriers to early detection and diagnosis include lower rates of screening by minorities and access issues due to lack of health insurance. Later detection of cancer, however, is not solely explained by structural barriers to obtaining health care. Evidence has accumulated that cultural and communication factors may play a role in outcome disparities caused by late detection. Appraisal delay occurs when patients fail to recognize or interpret symptoms they are experiencing as requiring medical attention. This can ultimately result in short or lengthy delays in making a diagnosis of cancer. We posit that factors that influence the perception and interpretation of symptoms may impede an earlier cancer diagnosis in racial and ethnic minorities and that these factors may further hamper communication between physicians and patients once patients actually present symptoms to their health care provider. The goal of this study is to examine how appraisal delay impedes the reporting of symptoms to their health care providers. We also hypothesize that these patients will have more difficulty effectively communicating these symptoms to their physicians during the clinical encounter. To accomplish this goal, we will interview recently diagnosed colon cancer patients using a semi-structured interview instrument to identify their interpretations and reporting of the symptoms that were indicative of colon cancer to confidantes and their health care providers. Time to delay between patient report of symptoms to their primary care providers and diagnosis (clinical diagnostic delay) will be validated by chart review. African- American men and women and white male and female patients with newly diagnosed colon cancer will be compared. The study's specific aims are: 1) Determine if appraisal delay and clinical diagnostic delay are associated with race/ethnicity and gender and examine factors that subsequently moderate this relationship; 2) Assess the communications between patients and their health care providers about symptom reporting; and 3) Use the results of this study to clarify the need for a communication study using direct observation methods to determine whether and how the communication process between patients and primary care providers contribute to diagnostic delay by communicating differently with patients by race and gender when they present pre-diagnosis symptoms of cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project can improve understanding of the barriers to early diagnosis of cancer and lead to interventions that can help patients understand their symptoms, communicate them more effectively to their health care providers, and ultimately lead to earlier cancer diagnoses and better outcomes.          ",Appraisal Delay and Disparities in Timely Cancer Diagnosis,7665399,R01CA134280,"['Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Health Professional ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cognitive ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Trust ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' Breast ', ' Structure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communication ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medical attention ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,460171,0.09156906606428594

Later detection of cancer, however, is not solely explained by structural barriers to obtaining health care. Evidence has accumulated that cultural and communication factors may play a role in outcome disparities caused by late detection. We propose to examine two important factors that are likely to contribute to a delay in the diagnosis of cancer. First, `appraisal delay', defined as patients' inability to identify, interpret, and bring symptoms to the attention of their physicians. Second, 'diagnostic delay', defined as physicians' inaction or incorrect actions to make a diagnosis. We will examine how diagnostic delay may be associated with an inability to understand, interpret, and communicate effectively with patients. The overall goal of this study is to understand how these factors contribute to delay in detecting cancers in African-Americans, using colon cancer as a paradigm for this phenomenon. The study's specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Identify and examine the factors that influence appraisal delay, e.g., patients' recognition, perception, and response to pre-diagnosis cancer symptoms. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 144 recently diagnosed colon cancer patients to identify their interpretations of the symptoms that eventually result in a diagnosis of cancer. African-American and white cancer patients will be compared. Aim 2. Test whether or not primary care physicians (PCPs) communicate with patients who present pre-diagnosis symptoms of cancer to PCPs differently depending on patient race and gender. To accomplish this, we will use an experimental design to compare the communication patterns and subsequent patient management decisions of a sample of 110 PCPs who will each meet with four unannounced trained patient simulators representing 4 gender-race combinations.This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians. The study's main goal is to improve understanding of the barriers to early diagnosis of cancer, lead to interventions that can help doctors and patients communicate more effectively, and ultimately lead to earlier cancer diagnoses.      Public Health Relevance: This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians.

"Neuroimaging and Behavioral Biomarkers for ADHD in Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area 03: Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and the specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent behavioral disorder of childhood affecting about 6 million school children and perhaps 10 million adults in the US. ADHD is however a very controversial disorder. Some critics question its validity, others argue that the criteria are too broad, too subjective, or not developmentally sensitive. Pediatric bipolar disorder is an even more controversial diagnosis, associated with widespread disparity between experts in criteria and prevalence rates. The aim of this Challenge Grant is to rigorously test our preliminary findings identifying three potential biomarkers. Two of these appear to be markers for ADHD that had perfect accuracy in discriminating between children with ADHD and controls in limited samples. However, these studies only included boys aged 9 - 12 who met criteria for Combined Subtype, and had been previously treated with methylphenidate (MPH). It is critical to ascertain if these findings can be replicated in an independent sample, extended to girls, older and younger individuals, to all ADHD subtypes, and to ADHD subjects with no prior history of psychotropic treatment. The third marker appears to identify children with bipolar disorder, and in a sample of 103 subjects distinguished bipolar from ADHD and controls with 94% sensitivity and specificity. Bipolar children in this sample met strict operational criteria for DSM-IV bipolar disorder. Hence, we propose to rigorously evaluate three potential biomarkers that address two severe but overlapping challenges. On one hand, there is the challenge of identifying where normal ends and where ADHD begins. On the other hand, there is the challenge of determining whether hyperactive, disruptive, aggressive and emotionally labile children have ADHD, bipolar disorder, both, or something entirely different. The first biomarker emerged from a state-of-the-art non-linear analysis of head movements and positional stability. The maximum Lyapunov exponent discriminated 62 ADHD children from 62 matched controls with perfect accuracy (ROC = 1.0). The second marker is a measure of regional T2-relaxation time (T2RT) in left putamen and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The third marker is a composite of actigraph measures of sleep, daytime hyperactivity and circadian dysregulation. Children with DSM-IV bipolar disorder had greater impairments in sleep and circadian rhythmicity than children with ADHD and comorbid mood disorders. The validity of these potential markers will be tested in a mixed gender sample of 160 children (80 ADHD, 40 bipolar, 40 control) between 6-17 years of age (n=80 neuroimaging). Identifying markers that distinguish ADHD from normal and ADHD from bipolar could have an enormous impact on the field. These findings (if further validated) can lead to a revamping of clinical criteria, and rapidly advance research into the genetics, etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of ADHD and pediatric bipolar disorder. This Challenge Grant is designed to test the validity of two potential biomarkers that in preliminary studies distinguished boys with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from controls with complete accuracy. A third biomarker will also be studied that distinguished children with bipolar disorder from subjects with ADHD and healthy normal controls with 94% sensitivity and specificity. These markers will be assessed in 160 children (6-17 years of age) from both genders. Eighty subjects will have ADHD, 40 bipolar disorder, and 40 will be healthy controls.               This Challenge Grant is designed to test the validity of two potential biomarkers that in preliminary studies distinguished boys with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from controls with complete accuracy.

"Conduct Disorder & Depression in Girls:  Precursors, Development and Comorbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive interventions depend in large part on the availability of reliable and specific information about the development of psychopathology. Three of the priority areas for clinical research identified in the 2007/2008 NIMH Strategic Plan are the 1) prediction of individuals at risk for developing disease; 2) personalization of knowledge about individual biological, environmental and social factors to better personalize interventions; and 3) participation of the diversity of people and settings in clinical research The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), a large-scale (n=2,451), longitudinal study of a representative, urban sample of African American and European American girls, is uniquely poised to illuminate each of these topic areas as they pertain to Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): two disorders that generate the greatest amount of morbidity among adolescent females and contribute the largest portion to the global burden of disease among women (Murray & Lopez. 1997). In particular, the PGS aims to predict female CD and MDD by building developmental models of risk and protection from the early identification of individual vulnerabilities that serve as childhood precursors to disorders, and the contexts in which such vulnerabilities are more likely to lead to disorder, by operationalizing sub-syndromal phenotypes of disorders, and by examining developmental changes in the pattern of comorbid conditions. Prediction will be based on multiple annual assessments of this racially and economically diverse sample with high rates of participant retention (average of 94 percent over 7 waves). Thus far, we have generated data on the onset, stability and developmental course of DSM-IV symptoms for CD and MDD and a broad range of other disorders. We also have assessed potential moderating and mediating factors on the development of symptomatology in girls. We are seeking funds to continue this prospective study through adolescence with five annual assessments of the girls and their mothers and fathers. The girls will be aged 13-16 in wave 1, and aged 17-20 years in wave 5. The planned assessments, when linked to the developmental data already collected during childhood, will elucidate precursors to CD and MDD in adolescence, their sub-syndromal phenotypes, common patterns of comorbidity, and risk, promotive and protective factors associated with transitions from precursor, to sub-syndrome, to disorder, and to comorbid disorders. The study is relevant for understanding ethnic disparities in the manifestation of CD and MDD and can serve as a building block for personalized, preventive and remedial treatments to be developed for specific subgroups of girls at risk of CD, MDD, their co-occurrence, and comorbidity with other disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood. The study also examines family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors that increase or reduce these risks. The diversity of the participants in this community sample (e.g. equal numbers of African American and European American girls, broad range of income levels) will allow information to be gathered about early and ongoing risks and problems that are more important for different subgroups, which can serve as building blocks for screening devices and the prevention of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems.           Project narrative The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood.

"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this program is to prevent complications of hemophilia and other bleeding disorders through assessment, surveillance, outreach, education, consultation, and management. A regional network of ten hemophilia treatment centers in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee will be coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. In 2005, Region IV-North (comprising nine hemophilia treatment centers [HTCs] in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee) had a total of 1,848 active patients with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. Hemophilia patients constitute 61.5% of the total patients, while 27.6% have von Willebrand disease and 10.9% have other bleeding disorders. In 2005, there were 380 active female patients, an increase of 25.2% over the 2004 total. Almost 22% of the active patients are from ethnic minority groups, with an explosive increase in Hispanics. In comparison to U.S. averages, there are higher poverty rates and lower educational levels within the region, predisposing individuals to suboptimal behaviors in relation to diet, exercise, and use of health care services. The network will collaborate with regional lay organizations and the four non-federally funded centers in the region to deliver appropriately tailored prevention messages aimed at reducing complications of bleeding disorders and improving health across the lifespan, with the intention of attaining and measuring specific outcomes to reduce complications. Further, the region will redouble its outreach to underserved populations, such as women and minorities, to integrate them into the HTC system. All of these efforts will be systematically evaluated to assess their efficacy. Surveillance of patients enrolled in the CDC's Universal Data Collection (UDC) project, which has collected samples and data from over 18,000 individuals nationally since 1998, will continue in order to monitor the safety of the blood supply. The network will also expand upon the UDC program to collect data that could be used for clinical research projects leading to improved health outcomes for individuals with bleeding disorders, accelerated adoption of healthy behaviors, the reduction or elimination of health disparities among various ethnic and racial groups and between genders, and the achievement of greater efficiency in the core public health infrastructure.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs,7679721,U01DD000199,[''],NCBDDD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2009,534113,0.04356228954973102
"Musculoskeletal Disorders and Health Behaviors among US Workers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) include a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative conditions and they constitute a major proportion of all reported and/or compensable work-related diseases contributing to substantial numbers of lost work days and medical care utilization in the United States. MSDs have multiple and inter-connected risk factors, both occupational and non-occupational, such as repetitive trauma, obesity, smoking, and physical activity. While the relationship between MSDs and work-related injuries has been comprehensively characterized, examination of worker health behaviors using a large nationally representative population database has not been studied. Using the 1997-2007 National Health Interview Survey and the 1996-2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey the following Specific Aims and Hypotheses will be examined: 1. Document and compare the prevalence, trends, and geographical variation of specific musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) for all US workers, youth workers and older workers by occupation/industry, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. 2. Assess the relationship between worker health behaviors (physical activity patterns, obesity, alcohol use, and tobacco exposure) with reported musculoskeletal disorders by occupation and National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Industry sector. 3. Estimate the health-related quality of life effects of having musculoskeletal disorders using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYS) by occupation and NORA Industry sector. Examining the under-explored associations between US Worker occupation, health behaviors (physical activity patterns, obesity, and tobacco exposure), health-related quality of life, economic impact and geographical location of musculoskeletal disorders is paramount to our understanding of their current and potential future impact on the health care and public health systems. As older adults remain in or re-enter the workforce in the coming years, worksite-based health promotion of ergonomic and musculoskeletal disorders will become an increasingly important venue for reaching older and newly entering working adults. Although little research has been completed in this area, it is the goal of this Minority F31 Application to examine these associations that inform workplace strategies to meet the unique needs of worker populations at-risk for musculoskeletal disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a non-traditional degree seeking DO/PhD student, my overall career goal is to develop into a well-rounded physician-scientist. I am interested in developing a career in musculoskeletal epidemiology with a particular focus on ergonomic and occupational risk factors including health-related quality of life measures. As an epidemiologist, I am also interested in the development of primary and secondary prevention programs to increase awareness of the rheumatic contributions to the morbidity and mortality of musculoskeletal disorders. The Kirschstein-NRSA F31 Individual Fellowship for Minority students will serve as a platform for me to develop a productive career in academic rheumatology and epidemiology, with an emphasis on investigating factors that are associated with musculoskeletal disorders in large populations. During this fellowship, with the assistance of my mentors, Drs Lora Fleming, David Lee and Robert Hoffman, I will garner many valuable skills and applications of epidemiology and musculoskeletal disorders. First, I will learn how to use data from large publically available datasets to examine musculoskeletal disorders. Secondly, I will learn to reconstruct data, select pertinent variables, and conduct data analyses using advanced statistical software packages. Lastly, I will develop an in-depth knowledge of occupational health and musculoskeletal disorders from both a clinical and epidemiologic point of view. This NRSA minority student fellowship training will enable me to expand my knowledge and skills needed in the fields of musculoskeletal and occupational epidemiology.           ",Musculoskeletal Disorders and Health Behaviors among US Workers,7756807,F31AR057687,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' degenerative disease ', ' degenerative condition ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Health system ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Population Database ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Occupational Epidemiology ', ' trend ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Expenditure ', ' Fellowship ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Gout ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ', ' NIAMS ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Industry ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Learning ', ' Articular ligaments ', ' joint ligament ', ' Individual ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity -

"Preparation and Patient Education to Reduce Postpartum Depressive Symptoms Maternal depressive symptoms are associated with reduced maternal quality of life, decreased ability to function, increased infant hospitalizations, reduced breastfeeding, less involvement of mothers with important developmental behaviors such as talking and playing, and increased maternal smoking and alcohol use. Recent studies have begun to examine the contextual setting of the early postpartum period and identify potentially modifiable determinants of postpartum depressive symptoms. Situational factors such as distress from physical symptoms, infant colic, and lack of social support are triggers for postpartum depressive symptoms while social support and mother's efficacy in managing situational stress buffer depressive reactions. We developed and pilot tested an intervention to reduce depressive symptoms in postpartum mothers by preparing and educating women about specific situational triggers of depressive symptoms, by bolstering personal and social resources, by enhancing self-management skills to buffer postpartum demands, and by increasing access to existing healthcare and community resources available to postpartum mothers. We obtained funding from NCMHD to conduct a randomized controlled study to test this intervention in Black and Hispanic mothers. The proposed study will add to this trial women from all racial/ethnic backgrounds. This is feasible within a two year time because of the large volume of deliveries at Mt. Sinai. Two staff members will be hired to accommodate this increased patient flow. Postpartum depressive symptoms are a major health problem that affects hundreds of thousands of women annually. We propose to test an intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and prevent elevated levels of depressive symptoms in postpartum mothers by preparing and educating women about specific situational triggers of depressive symptoms, by bolstering personal and social resources, by enhancing self-management skills to buffer postpartum demands, and by increasing access to existing healthcare and community resources available to postpartum mothers.",Preparation and Patient Education to Reduce Postpartum Depressive Symptoms,7581612,R01MH077683,"['prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Symptoms ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Infant ', ' Distress ', ' Funding ', ' Mothers ', ' Infantile Colic ', ' infant colic ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Reaction ', ' Behavior ', ' Physical Function ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Buffers ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Self Management ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' maternal smoking ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' secondary outcome ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2009,841672,0.03209068819313747
"A First-Line Community-Based Mindfulness Trauma Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, ""Mindfulness-Based Trauma Interventions: Healing the Whole Person"" outlines a research program for developing an Intervention Development to Services: Exploratory Research Grant (R34). Our overall goal is to address the huge mental health care disparity for low-income, minority women exposed to intimate partner violence by obtaining new knowledge and skills in order to develop and test an accessible, tailored, and culturally-appropriate mindfulness-based intervention suitable as a first-line intervention or delivery in non-mental health community settings. Mindfulness is described as ""bringing one's complete attention to the present experience on a moment- to-moment basis"" (Marlatt & Kristeller, 1999, p. 68). Mindfulness interventions have been developed to address an array of physical and mental health problems (Baer, 2003). However, none address the needs of trauma populations. The devastating effects of violence extend to both mental and physical health problems. Notably, violence has been identified as one of the ten leading health indicators in Health People 2010. PTSD is a particularly prevalent outcome of IPV, with some studies reporting more than three- quarters of battered women meeting diagnostic criteria (e.g., Jones, 2001; Kemp, et al. 1995). To narrow the remarkable mental health disparities gap, three interrelated studies using different methodologies will be conducted to develop and pilot test an adapted mindfulness-based trauma intervention. This application has three specific aims all of which are congruent with the stated mission of the NIMH R34: 1) to develop a mindfulness-based trauma intervention for PTSD and other trauma-related psychological (depression, somatic symptoms, quality of life). Intervention development will include writing intervention and training manuals, developing measures of intervention fidelity, and pre-piloting the intervention for feasibility and accountability; 2) to pilot test the interventions with low-income, predominately African-American women exposed to intimate partner violence and to examine potential mediators (mindfulness, coping self- efficacy, social support) of improved outcomes, and 3) to pilot test measures of the cost of administering the intervention. This pilot study will provide preliminary data for a rigorous large scale clinical trial to examine both self-report and biological outcomes of the mindfulness-based trauma intervention. Mindfulness is described as ""bringing one's complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis"" (Marlatt & Kristeller, 1999, p. 68). The purpose of the application, ""Mindfulness-Based Trauma Interventions: Healing the Whole Person"" is to develop and test a mindfulness-based intervention that is appropriate and suitable in community settings for women with a history of intimate partner violence and who are experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. This application has three specific aims all of which are congruent with the stated mission of the NIMH R34: 1) to develop a mindfulness-based trauma intervention for PTSD and other trauma-related psychological (depression, somatic symptoms, quality of life); 2) to pilot test the interventions with low-income, African-American women exposed to intimate partner violence, and 3) to measure the cost of administering the intervention. This pilot study will provide preliminary data for a rigorous large scale clinical trial to examine both self- report and biological outcomes of the mindfulness-based trauma intervention.          ",A First-Line Community-Based Mindfulness Trauma Intervention,7628439,R34MH077066,"['Cost Measures ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Healed ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Life Experience ', ' Individual ', ' Love ', ' Battered Women ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' depression ', ' mindfulness ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Exposure to ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Event ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Borderline Personality Disorder ', ' BPD ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' cultural competence ', ' empowerment ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Accountability ', ' Measures ', ' tau Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule-associated protein tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule associated protein tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R34,2009,307000,-0.009967152976762554
"Early Social Communication Characteristics of ASD in Diverse Cultures in the US a There is a pressing need to improve early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) so that families can access intensive, appropriate intervention services as early as possible. However, studies indicate that important racial and ethnic disparities exist in the identification and diagnosis of children with ASD in the US, which impact access to services. Very little research is available on ASD from developing countries. This research investigation is a foundational study of early social communication markers of ASD in children from two diverse cultures from two different countries- Latino immigrants in Southeastern US and the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province of South Africa. These two regions were selected to inform future epidemiological research on ASD in diverse populations both in the US and other developing countries. Children in this study will range from 18 to 36 months of age. This study will use an observational case-control research design to compare early behavioral markers of ASD in 15 children who end up with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD from a predominantly Latino immigrant population in Collier County, Florida in the southeastern US (ASD-US1), 15 young African children from KZN who end up with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (ASD-Africa), and matched control children from Leon County, Florida, who have been diagnosed with ASD by the FIRST WORDS(R) Project (ASD-US2). The three groups of children with ASD will be compared to groups of typically developing (TD) children from each site (TD-US1, TD-Africa, TD- US2). Children will be recruited with autism-specific screening tools adapted for these low-resource settings. We will first conduct a series of focus groups to adapt the screening and diagnostic tools to be culturally appropriate and to understand the influence of culture on expectations of children and understanding of disabilities including ASD. Social communication markers of ASD will be compared during two different video recorded observation methods-structured observations using systematic sampling procedures and naturalistic observations of everyday activities. A clinical diagnosis of ASD based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria will be confirmed or ruled out by experienced clinicians using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. These findings will provide information about the relationship between culture and ASD in order to advance science on the heterogeneity of ASD and have important implications for informing research on genetic and environmental mechanisms of ASD. This research study is pivotal to our long term aims of adapting screening and diagnostic tools for epidemiological research and strengthening in-country and global collaboration to build the capacity in low-resource settings for appropriate accessible early intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The expected outcomes of this study will have significance for the field by identifying behavioral markers that distinguish young Latino children in the Southeastern US and African children from KwaZulu-Natal with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from children with typical development from those cultures. It is important to investigate the relationship between culture and ASD in order to advance science on the heterogeneity of ASD. Cultural differences may be evident in the behavioral phenotype of ASD, recognition and interpretation of symptoms by caregivers, the decisions parents make regarding evaluation and treatment, and interactions between families and the healthcare system. The results of this research will lead to culturally sensitive screening and evaluation methods that may decrease the age at which all children with ASD are diagnosed.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The expected outcomes of this study will have significance for the field by identifying behavioral markers that distinguish young Latino children in the Southeastern US and African children from KwaZulu-Natal with ASD from children with typical development from those cultures.

"Cross-Cultural Comparison of Interactions Between Anxious Mothers and Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this training grant is to promote positive youth development in Latino youths by examining parenting practices that place youths at heightened risk for developing anxiety. Long-term, this will allow the candidate to tailor interventions to better serve diverse families and reduce mental health disparity. Training goals for this fellowship are to equip the candidate with (a) understanding of the interplay between family processes, culture, and youth outcome, (b) skills to develop innovative, culturally-appropriate anxiety interventions, (c) capacity to conduct rigorous investigations using sound research design and quantitative methods. These goals will be met through mentorship from leading researchers and coursework completion. The training plan will culminate in the completion of the proposed original project. This cross-sectional case-control study will examine observed interactions between mothers (N = 60; 30 Non-Hispanic White, 30 Mexican American) with an anxiety disorder diagnosis and their children (ages 8-14) to examine cross- cultural differences in parenting behaviors (e.g., control, autonomy-granting, criticism, warmth, anxiety- modeling) and their associations with youth psychological symptoms and functioning. Specific aims are to (1) examine cultural differences in observed parenting behaviors of anxious mothers, (2) specify associations between parenting behaviors and youth mental health outcomes, and (3) assess potential moderators of the relationship between observed parenting behaviors and youth symptoms, including ethnicity and child perception of parenting. Anxiety is the most prevalent mental health problem in the U.S. in adults and youths. Anxiety is more highly prevalent in Hispanic populations, who are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the U.S. Anxiety interferes with youths' abilities to reach their full adult potential by negatively impacting social relationships, school achievement, and psychological well-being. Parenting behaviors are often implicated in the development of youth anxiety; however, behaviors of anxious Mexican Americans, who place different cultural value on practices such as parental control, have not been examined. Therefore, this study is of high theoretical and public health importance. This project is an initial step toward identifying culture-specific parent behaviors that place youths at high-risk for developing internalizing disorders and that may serve to transmit anxiety from parent to child. It will lay the groundwork for future development of culturally- appropriate child anxiety preventive interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My long-term career goal is to increase the efficiency of interventions for youths and families with early onset anxiety problems and to aid in the customization of treatment to ethnic minority groups to reduce racial mental health disparity. Anxiety is prevalent, distressing, and disabling, and its treatment and prevention will enhance the likelihood that youths will lead healthy lives, free from disorder and disability. Previous research indicates that parental psychopathology may play a large role in both the development and maintenance of youth anxiety, as well as for the n of interventions. Specific parenting behaviors have been implicated, however, little is known about how these findings may generalize to other cultural groups. A major unexplored area is the potentially different parenting practices of anxious mothers across cultures.           ",Cross-Cultural Comparison of Interactions Between Anxious Mothers and Children,7754526,F31HD062272,"['Cross-Cultural Comparison ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' early onset ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mothers ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Life ', ' sound ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Investigation ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Emotional ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Friendships ', ' Goals ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,41176,-0.0015698412140294946
"Conduct Disorder & Depression in Girls:  Precursors, Development and Comorbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive interventions depend in large part on the availability of reliable and specific information about the development of psychopathology. Three of the priority areas for clinical research identified in the 2007/2008 NIMH Strategic Plan are the 1) prediction of individuals at risk for developing disease; 2) personalization of knowledge about individual biological, environmental and social factors to better personalize interventions; and 3) participation of the diversity of people and settings in clinical research The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), a large-scale (n=2,451), longitudinal study of a representative, urban sample of African American and European American girls, is uniquely poised to illuminate each of these topic areas as they pertain to Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): two disorders that generate the greatest amount of morbidity among adolescent females and contribute the largest portion to the global burden of disease among women (Murray & Lopez. 1997). In particular, the PGS aims to predict female CD and MDD by building developmental models of risk and protection from the early identification of individual vulnerabilities that serve as childhood precursors to disorders, and the contexts in which such vulnerabilities are more likely to lead to disorder, by operationalizing sub-syndromal phenotypes of disorders, and by examining developmental changes in the pattern of comorbid conditions. Prediction will be based on multiple annual assessments of this racially and economically diverse sample with high rates of participant retention (average of 94 percent over 7 waves). Thus far, we have generated data on the onset, stability and developmental course of DSM-IV symptoms for CD and MDD and a broad range of other disorders. We also have assessed potential moderating and mediating factors on the development of symptomatology in girls. We are seeking funds to continue this prospective study through adolescence with five annual assessments of the girls and their mothers and fathers. The girls will be aged 13-16 in wave 1, and aged 17-20 years in wave 5. The planned assessments, when linked to the developmental data already collected during childhood, will elucidate precursors to CD and MDD in adolescence, their sub-syndromal phenotypes, common patterns of comorbidity, and risk, promotive and protective factors associated with transitions from precursor, to sub-syndrome, to disorder, and to comorbid disorders. The study is relevant for understanding ethnic disparities in the manifestation of CD and MDD and can serve as a building block for personalized, preventive and remedial treatments to be developed for specific subgroups of girls at risk of CD, MDD, their co-occurrence, and comorbidity with other disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood. The study also examines family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors that increase or reduce these risks. The diversity of the participants in this community sample (e.g. equal numbers of African American and European American girls, broad range of income levels) will allow information to be gathered about early and ongoing risks and problems that are more important for different subgroups, which can serve as building blocks for screening devices and the prevention of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems.

"Home-Based Diabetes Symptom Self-Management for Mexican Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans are affected by type 2 diabetes at twice the rate of non-Hispanic Whites and they suffer higher rates of diabetes-related complications. Because Mexican Americans are more likely to lack health insurance or access to medical care, many may depend solely on self-evaluation and self-management of diabetes and its symptoms. The proposed study uses a repeated measures experimental design to determine the feasibility of delivering a culturally-specific intervention focusing on diabetes symptom self-management for Mexican Americans, examine preliminary measures of the intervention's effectiveness and costs, and assess participants' perceptions of the intervention. The proposed intervention is both standardized and tailored to participants' unique symptoms. Participants in the experimental condition will receive 8 weekly in-home 90-minute interactive one-on-one educational and behavior modification sessions with a registered nurse focusing on symptom awareness, glucose self- testing, and subsequent appropriate treatment (weeks 1   8) and 8 biweekly follow-up support telephone calls (weeks 10   24). A wait-listed control group (WLC) will serve as a comparison for the intervention group at all data points. Participants in the WLC will be offered the home-based portion of the intervention beginning in week 26. A total of 72 Mexican American adults, aged 25-75, with type 2 diabetes will participate in the study (36 in each group).  The feasibility and costs of conducting the home-based intervention will be evaluated using process evaluation and basic cost analyses. Data to assess the effects of the intervention (including symptom- related knowledge, glucometer use, physiologic indicators of health: glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, weight, lipids, confidence in diabetes self-management, and quality of life) will be collected from participants in both intervention and WLC groups at three points: baseline (week 0), immediately post- intervention (week 9), and 120 days post-intervention (week 25) to examine long-term effects of the intervention on A1c levels.

"Treatment Response in Ethnic Minority Individuals With Binge Eating Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Binge eating disorder (BED) is prevalent in the United States and is associated with serious distress and impairment. Recent data suggest that BED, unlike other eating disorders, is as likely to be diagnosed among African American and Hispanic/Latino Americans as among Caucasians, and health problems associated with BED may disproportionately affect minority ethnic/racial groups. Although a sizable number of clinical trials of psychotherapy for BED have been conducted, no individual clinical trials have included individuals from minority ethnic groups in sufficient numbers to allow for ethnic/racial group comparisons. This study proposes to conduct a preliminary investigation of symptom presentation and psychosocial treatment response among African American and Hispanic/Latino subjects with BED through the re-analysis of existing data. We propose to aggregate data from multiple trials of psychosocial treatments of BED to produce the power necessary to compare ethnic groups and examine correlates of severity and outcome. We have created a willing network of investigators who have conducted randomized clinical trials for the treatment of BED in the United States since 1995. Preliminary data analysis indicates that the aggregation of available clinical trial data should yield data for N = 107 African American and N = 53 Hispanic/Latino treatment trial participants, as well N > 800 Caucasian participants. The aims of the current study will be (1) to compare baseline symptomatology in treatment-seeking subjects from African American and Hispanic/Latino backgrounds (including body mass index (BMI), rates of binge eating, cognitive eating disorder symptoms, and associated depression and anxiety) to that of Caucasian participants in trials of BED, to examine the associations of SES with severity in these groups, and to examine the characteristics of treatment-seeking subjects relative to two non-treatment seeking epidemiological samples; (2) to compare drop out, improvement, and recovery of subjects with African American and Hispanic/Latino backgrounds to that of Caucasian participants in trials of BED and examine the interrelationships of race/ethnicity and other predictors such as pre-treatment severity, BMI, SES, and depression, and their relative impact on outcome. This study will provide important data to address health disparities in this area, including issues in treatment access and treatment outcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to study binge eating disorder symptomatology and treatment response among African American and Hispanic/Latinos who have participated in psychotherapy trials for treatments of this disorder as binge eating disorder is the most prevalent eating disorder in the United States, and it appears to be equally prevalent in African American and Hispanic/Latino groups in the United States as in Caucasian groups. Preliminary data also suggest it is equally prevalent among sub-groups of those from minority ethnic/racial groups defined by country of origin, acculturation status, and other factors. Although African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos suffer as much as or more from binge eating disorder, obesity, and physical health issues linked to obesity, they are less likely to receive treatment for binge eating disorder and this study will attempt to define and understand health disparities in this area, and assess the relative impact of socioeconomic and related mental health factors in minority ethnic/racial and Caucasian subjects.           This application proposes to study binge eating disorder symptomatology and treatment response among African American and Hispanic/Latinos who have participated in psychotherapy trials for treatments of this disorder as binge eating disorder is the most prevalent eating disorder in the United States, and it appears to be equally prevalent in African American and Hispanic/Latino groups in the United States as in Caucasian groups.

"Effects of Cancer Symptoms on Minority Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career goal of Dr. Guadalupe Palos is to establish herself as an independent investigator in cancer control and behavioral science, with a focus on underserved and minority populations.  The candidate's career plan offers an excellent opportunity to combine her previous training in oncology nursing and community social work with her academic preparation in health service research and behavioral science.  The revised research plan has been greatly simplified and is designed to build upon an NIH-funded longitudinal study of symptoms in patients with advanced lung cancer (Principal Investigator, CS Cleeland, PhD).  The study includes underserved minority and non-minority patients who will receive treatment in an inner city county hospital.  This is an excellent opportunity to study the caregivers of ethnic minorities, who, because of their socioeconomic status, may be highly stressed or overwhelmed compared to other caregivers of cancer patients.       This application integrates mentoring, training, and focused research to meet 3 objectives: a) to become an established investigator in the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches in cancer control and behavioral science; 2) to use these multi-methods approaches to study the problems of caregivers and the patients they care for; and 3) to evaluate the effects of sociocultural factors on the caregiver's experience. Dr. Palos' exceptional mentor team consists of Charles S. Cleeland, PhD, Richard Payne, MD., Marjorie Kagawa-Singer, PhD, and Amalie Ramirez, PhD.  Dr. Cleeland will provide mentorship in research related to measurement of symptoms.  Dr. Payne, world-renown for his work in disparities and pain management will provide mentorship in these areas.  Dr. Singer will be a mentor in the conceptualization and measurement of culture and ethnicity.  Dr. Ramirez will mentor the candidate in developing culturally competent cancer communication for future caregiver interventions.  Formal agreements and specific roles of the mentoring team have been documented and included.  The research training will take place at MD Anderson Cancer Center/Lyndon Baines Hospital, and to a lesser extent at University of California (Dr. Kagawa-Singer), Hispanic Center of Excellence - San Antonio (Dr. Amelie G. Ramirez), and Duke University -Durham, NC (Dr. Payne).       Research examining the negative outcomes in underserved minority caregivers, such as depression, stress, anxiety, pain, fatigue, or sleep disturbances, would help advance our understanding of these problems.  This project has a longitudinal, descriptive design to evaluate these areas.  The specific aims will be to (1) describe the meaning of the experience of being a minority (African-American or Latino) and non-minority person caring for a patient with advanced lung cancer; (2) describe and compare the experiences of minority and non-minority caregivers including the prevalence and severity of physical/psychological symptoms and their influence on caregiver symptom burden; and (3) assess the relationship between caregiver's symptoms (physical and psychological) and patient's symptom's at multiple time points over the course of the patient's treatment.  The findings from this project will provide information from a sociocultural perspective that can be used to develop culturally competent interventions that can help reduce caregiver burden and improve their health outcomes.             ",Effects of Cancer Symptoms on Minority Caregivers,7631301,K07CA102482,"['Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Oncologic Nursing ', ' oncology nursing ', ' Oncological Nursing ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' meetings ', ' Oncology Nurse ', ' inner city ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' advanced disease ', ' Agreement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' medically underserved ', ' chemotherapy ', ' standard measure ', ' depression ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2009,107317,0.01424379388476827
"Parent Screeners for Bipolarity in Hispanic Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with Early-Onset Bipolar Disorder (EOBD) present with symptoms that can be confused with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). One of the biggest challenges faced by clinicians is differentiating between children with EOBD and those with ADHD. The consequences of falsely diagnosing children with EOBD can lead to inappropriate or harmful intervention. Additionally, failing to identify and treat EOBD children can lead to recurrent mood episodes, and more severe symptoms. At present, there are no validated screening tools or assessment aids for use in Spanish-speaking families, nor is it known whether   existing measures could be used in English speaking Hispanic families without clinically meaningful bias. A review of the literature indicates that to date no studies have been conducted on a sample of primarily Hispanic children (Youngstrom, Findling, Youngstrom, & Calabrese, 2005). There are important cultural reasons that the performance of parent-reported instruments might be different in a Hispanic population, such as the primacy of family in the lives of its members (referred to as ""familism"" in ethnographic studies). This study will evaluate the extent to which acculturation variables moderate the value or accuracy of information obtained from four different screening instruments for diagnosing EOBD in a group of Hispanic children. In addition to the usual value of validating measures in a new population, we will be using a conceptual framework that examines if familism and attributions about mental illness impact diagnostic accuracy in Hispanics. Data will be collected on a case series of 40 children diagnosed with EOBD and a sample of 40 children that have not been diagnosed with EOBD. The two groups of children will be compared to determine whether parental instruments aid in accurately differentiating children diagnosed with EOBD from non EOBD children. The long term objectives are to evaluate the psychometrics of all the mood rating scales in larger samples of English and Spanish-speaking Hispanic participants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the rapid increase in the size of the Hispanic population and the rate of EOBD diagnosis, the development and testing of assessment tools for these families is of crucial public health importance. The proposed study is directly relevant to the Healthy People 2010 (originally Health People 2000) initiative of NIH (November,   2000), which has made the elimination of health disparities a national priority (see www. healthypeople.gov). Results of this study will improve the ability to diagnose and treat EOBD children in this underrepresented and underserved population.             ",Parent Screeners for Bipolarity in Hispanic Children,7697105,F31MH078294,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Symptoms ', ' Case Series ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' early onset ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Moods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Review Literature ', ' Parents ', ' tool ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Psychometrics ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' instrument ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Illness impact ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMH,CARLOS ALBIZU UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,31832,0.049484553943305615
"PDRemote: Automated Telehealth Diagnostics for Remote Parkinson's Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective is to design, build, and clinically assess a system for automated telehealth diagnostics for remote Parkinson's disease (PD) monitoring. Currently in the United States, there are approximately 1 million patients living with PD and 50,000 new cases reported each year. However, there is limited access to movement disorder specialist centers for a significant portion of this population (Fig 2) as well as limited opportunity for remote continuous monitoring of motor symptoms to capture complex fluctuation patterns and optimize treatment protocols. The proposed PDRemote"" system will integrate an existing advanced wireless movement disorder monitoring technology with a new infrastructure to remotely monitor PD patient symptoms. A repeatable, automated tool to more continuously monitor PD motor symptoms at home and remotely transmit severity reports to a clinician should improve outcomes and decrease costs for disparate patient populations not in close proximity to movement disorder specialists. Major PD symptoms include tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Additionally, dyskinesias or wild involuntary movements as a side effect of drug therapy can be a motor complication. The current standard in evaluating symptoms is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a qualitative ranking system. The UPDRS motor section includes several movements the patient completes to elicit motor symptoms while a clinician qualitatively assesses the symptoms with a 0 - 4 score. It is normally completed during an office visit to obtain a snapshot of motor symptom severity. Clinicians currently lack effective, affordable technologies that can be easily delivered to PD patients for monitoring symptoms on a more continuous basis as symptoms typically fluctuate during the day as a function of treatment parameters. CleveMed previously developed a compact wireless system to quantify movement disorder symptoms called Kinesia"". This previously existing technology will serve as the hardware platform for this proposed program. With only minor hardware upgrades required to fit PDRemote and excellent clinical results to date, this existing base enhances likelihood of project success. While previous work has shown excellent results to objectively quantify symptoms during an in clinic exam, this proposed project will integrate several new features to translate this technology from the clinic to a patient's home. This will provide a clinically deployable evaluation tool that doctors can remotely order and then receive reports detailing a patient's PD symptom severity. The clinical technology resulting from this development will allow PD motor symptoms to be remotely monitored by clinicians on a more continuous basis. This should reduce costs and improve clinical outcomes by providing greater time resolution of symptom fluctuations and improving access to symptom monitoring for disparate populations in remote locations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson's disease is primarily characterized by motor symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and rigidity which can be very debilitating, leading to decreased mobility, independence, and quality of life. Clinicians lack quantitative tools for more continuous monitoring that capture how motor symptoms fluctuate during the day in response to treatment protocols to help minimize Parkinson's motor symptoms. PDRemote"" will be a repeatable, automated system clinicians will use to remotely monitor PD motor symptoms on a more continuous basis in a patient's home that should improve outcomes and decrease costs especially for disparate patient populations in areas not in close proximity to movement disorder specialists.           Parkinson's disease is primarily characterized by motor symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and rigidity which can be very debilitating, leading to decreased mobility, independence, and quality of life.

"Hormones/Genes in Women's Health: From Bench to Bedside DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of this BIRCWH proposal is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders, and those disorders specific to women. This application seeks support to create an integrated interdisciplinary training program that will be based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program will be modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption in this BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) will be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. This BIRCWH program will capitalize on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Scholars will be assigned a team of Mentors. In order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner, each of four Scholars will be assigned a Primary and Secondary Mentor. Primary Mentors will be in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors will be in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and will help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. A Career Mentor (senior HMS/HSPH faculty and senior administrators) will advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Finally there will be a Mentor in Health Disparities, who will expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity can be influenced by social/environmental factors. This BIRCWH proposal will focus on the following disorders, given both the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health.

"Feasibility of Telehealth CBT for Social Anxiety Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social anxiety disorder (SAD), a psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent and intense fear of one or more social situations that are avoided or endured with marked distress, is the third most common psychiatric disorder and can lead to substantial interference and suffering. Research on interventions for SAD has demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Despite the substantial empirical support of CBT for SAD, lack of access to the best psychosocial treatments represents a significant public health problem. In particular, access to appropriate, empirically supported care in rural areas is often limited due to a number of barriers, including shortage of health-care specialists in rural areas and distance from services. One approach to overcoming such barriers is to utilize new technologies that may help increase access to care. Telehealth-delivered psychotherapy may be particularly useful in addressing this problem. A growing body of evidence has documented the utility of telehealth-delivered medical health-care, particularly telepsychiatry. Social anxiety disorder is an ideal disorder to test the feasibility of such a treatment modality, given the interpersonal focus of the disorder and that efficacious treatments have been identified. Therefore, the proposed study will examine the efficacy and acceptability of CBT for social anxiety disorder delivered via a telehealth format. Participants will undergo a comprehensive diagnostic interview and baseline assessment. Participants with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder will be randomly assigned to either receive telehealth-delivered CBT (TH) or a waitlist (WL) control group. Following treatment, participants will complete a posttreatment assessment and diagnostic interview. If treatment can be successfully delivered in a telehealth format for individuals with SAD, then the same format should be efficacious for the other anxiety disorders, for which highly effective exposure-based treatments are also available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Telehealth-delivered psychotherapy may be particularly useful to address disparities in access to care, a significant public health problem, by increasing the availability of treatment. If treatment can be successfully delivered in a telehealth format for individuals with SAD, this will help establish the feasibility of utilizing telehealth technology to deliver evidence-based mental health services and, thus, increasing access to care. Establishing the feasibility of telehealth-delivered treatment with SAD would also suggest that the same format should be similarly efficacious for other anxiety disorders, given the similarities of exposure-based treatments.              Project Narrative Telehealth-delivered psychotherapy may be particularly useful to address disparities in access to care, a significant public health problem, by increasing the availability of treatment.

"PDRemote: Automated Telehealth Diagnostics for Remote Parkinson's Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective is to design, build, and clinically assess a system for automated telehealth diagnostics for remote Parkinson's disease (PD) monitoring. Currently in the United States, there are approximately 1 million patients living with PD and 50,000 new cases reported each year. However, there is limited access to movement disorder specialist centers for a significant portion of this population (Fig 2) as well as limited opportunity for remote continuous monitoring of motor symptoms to capture complex fluctuation patterns and optimize treatment protocols. The proposed PDRemote"" system will integrate an existing advanced wireless movement disorder monitoring technology with a new infrastructure to remotely monitor PD patient symptoms. A repeatable, automated tool to more continuously monitor PD motor symptoms at home and remotely transmit severity reports to a clinician should improve outcomes and decrease costs for disparate patient populations not in close proximity to movement disorder specialists. Major PD symptoms include tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Additionally, dyskinesias or wild involuntary movements as a side effect of drug therapy can be a motor complication. The current standard in evaluating symptoms is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a qualitative ranking system. The UPDRS motor section includes several movements the patient completes to elicit motor symptoms while a clinician qualitatively assesses the symptoms with a 0 - 4 score. It is normally completed during an office visit to obtain a snapshot of motor symptom severity. Clinicians currently lack effective, affordable technologies that can be easily delivered to PD patients for monitoring symptoms on a more continuous basis as symptoms typically fluctuate during the day as a function of treatment parameters. CleveMed previously developed a compact wireless system to quantify movement disorder symptoms called Kinesia"". This previously existing technology will serve as the hardware platform for this proposed program. With only minor hardware upgrades required to fit PDRemote and excellent clinical results to date, this existing base enhances likelihood of project success. While previous work has shown excellent results to objectively quantify symptoms during an in clinic exam, this proposed project will integrate several new features to translate this technology from the clinic to a patient's home. This will provide a clinically deployable evaluation tool that doctors can remotely order and then receive reports detailing a patient's PD symptom severity. The clinical technology resulting from this development will allow PD motor symptoms to be remotely monitored by clinicians on a more continuous basis. This should reduce costs and improve clinical outcomes by providing greater time resolution of symptom fluctuations and improving access to symptom monitoring for disparate populations in remote locations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson's disease is primarily characterized by motor symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and rigidity which can be very debilitating, leading to decreased mobility, independence, and quality of life. Clinicians lack quantitative tools for more continuous monitoring that capture how motor symptoms fluctuate during the day in response to treatment protocols to help minimize Parkinson's motor symptoms. PDRemote"" will be a repeatable, automated system clinicians will use to remotely monitor PD motor symptoms on a more continuous basis in a patient's home that should improve outcomes and decrease costs especially for disparate patient populations in areas not in close proximity to movement disorder specialists.           Parkinson's disease is primarily characterized by motor symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements), and rigidity which can be very debilitating, leading to decreased mobility, independence, and quality of life.

"Tools to Optimize Patient Presentation Speed after Onset of Exudative Macular Deg    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific Aims: 1 - to refine a novel set of low cost patent pending interactive home AMD education and monitoring tools that combine tests evaluated favorably in Phase I together with additional novel tools currently in prototype. 2 - To clinically evaluate the effectiveness of these tools in reducing the delay between onset of symptoms and presentation, thus potentially minimizing vision loss. Significance: Macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in those over 60. New anti-VEGF treatments introduced in 2005 are effective if given early but patients typically wait for up to 5 months after the onset of symptoms to see a healthcare professional, leading to unnecessary vision loss. This results in incremental costs of care (which most often accrue to Medicare), a higher societal burden and lower patient quality of life. In earlier studies, we have identified critical reasons for patient delay and significant gaps in the current standard of care. Our solutions address the most significant reasons for patient delay in a cost-effective format capable of distribution to millions of patients, that, if successful, will accelerate presentation and minimize vision loss for a significant population of patients. Background: There are almost 10 million people with early AMD in the US, with the number expected to rise to 17.8 million by 2050. 2,3 of this population, 10 to 15% of dry patients will eventually convert to wet AMD.4 The conversion from dry to wet AMD can occur suddenly and has been historically difficult to recognize and respond to by patients. Delays in presentation of up to 5 months are common.8 In a recent study of patients with newly diagnosed wet AMD, the most common patient-cited reasons for delay were lack of confidence in symptoms, and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the problem. The current gold standard of home monitoring, the Amsler Grid, developed in the 1940's, does not address the top reasons for delay, nor does it address the variety of symptoms that patients experience with advancing disease. New electronic technologies for improving home monitoring AMD have demonstrated sensitivity and specificity, but their cost and learning curve can limit broad-scale distribution. A solution is required that 1) addresses the multiple reasons for delay, 2) is low-cost and amenable to distribution across large populations, 3) includes multiple interactive elements that address patient compliance and individual needs, and 4) fosters appropriate and timely action. Research design and methods: 1) conduct focus group evaluation of current prototype tools. 2) Refine the prototypes based upon patient feedback. 3) Conduct a clinical evaluation of the performance of the novel tools, measuring drop in visual acuity prior to presentation after onset of wet AMD. If successful, tools will enable broad-scale outreach, reduce educational disparities, foster routine eye exams, help accelerate patient presentation, help reduce vision loss, and help lower the socioeconomic burden of AMD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in adults over the age of 60.1 New injectable treatments introduced in 2005 are effective if given early but patients typically wait for up to 5 months after the onset of symptoms to see a healthcare professional, leading to unnecessary vision loss.

"Preparation and Patient Education to Reduce Postpartum Depressive Symptoms Maternal depressive symptoms are associated with reduced maternal quality of life, decreased ability to function, increased infant hospitalizations, reduced breastfeeding, less involvement of mothers with important developmental behaviors such as talking and playing, and increased maternal smoking and alcohol use. Recent studies have begun to examine the contextual setting of the early postpartum period and identify potentially modifiable determinants of postpartum depressive symptoms. Situational factors such as distress from physical symptoms, infant colic, and lack of social support are triggers for postpartum depressive symptoms while social support and mother's efficacy in managing situational stress buffer depressive reactions. We developed and pilot tested an intervention to reduce depressive symptoms in postpartum mothers by preparing and educating women about specific situational triggers of depressive symptoms, by bolstering personal and social resources, by enhancing self-management skills to buffer postpartum demands, and by increasing access to existing healthcare and community resources available to postpartum mothers. We obtained funding from NCMHD to conduct a randomized controlled study to test this intervention in Black and Hispanic mothers. The proposed study will add to this trial women from all racial/ethnic backgrounds. This is feasible within a two year time because of the large volume of deliveries at Mt. Sinai. Two staff members will be hired to accommodate this increased patient flow.  Postpartum depressive symptoms are a major health problem that affects hundreds of thousands of women annually. We propose to test an intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and prevent elevated levels of depressive symptoms in postpartum mothers by preparing and educating women about specific situational triggers of depressive symptoms, by bolstering personal and social resources, by enhancing self-management skills to buffer postpartum demands, and by increasing access to existing healthcare and community resources available to postpartum mothers.",Preparation and Patient Education to Reduce Postpartum Depressive Symptoms,7835774,R01MH077683,"['Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Reaction ', ' Behavior ', ' Physical Function ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Buffers ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Self Management ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Community Services ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' maternal smoking ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Symptoms ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Infant ', ' Distress ', ' Funding ', ' Mothers ', ' Infantile Colic ', ' infant colic ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2010,815566,0.03209068819313747
"Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing renewal application seeks to extend our previous work among patients with end stage lung disease to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, enhanced coping skills training (CST) protocol for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is an obstructive airway disease marked by symptoms of dyspnea, paroxysmal coughing, pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Approximately 12.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD and 70 percent of these cases represent individuals under the age of 65. COPD patients who are at an early stage of their disease often experience a progressive worsening of symptoms, while the advanced stages of the disease may be marked by frequent visits to the emergency department or inpatient hospitalizations for acute COPD exacerbations. Importantly, COPD also is a fatal condition for many patients, and is the fourth leading cause of preventable death for both men and women in the United States, with over 120,000 deaths reported in 2002. Although COPD is preventable (i.e., by not smoking), there is no cure for the disease and therefore the symptoms must be managed effectively. It has been well-established that brief, focused cognitive-behavioral therapy can significantly improve psychological function in medically ill persons, the wide geographic distribution of patients with COPD, along with their chronic exacerbations of illness, make face-to-face delivery of such therapy extremely difficult. Our previous work demonstrated that a telephone-based coping skills intervention (CST) with patients awaiting lung transplantation was effective in improving quality of life but did not improve physical functioning or survival. In that study, patients with COPD at an earlier stage of their disease process appeared to benefit most from CST. Thus, the present application proposes a larger, dual-site (Duke and Ohio State University), randomized trial among patients with COPD, using a comprehensive set of outcome measures over an extended follow-up period. Six hundred COPD patients will be randomly assigned to either a telephone-based enhanced, caregiver-assisted CST intervention or to a Usual care plus education and symptom monitoring Control group. Patients and their self-identified caregivers will undergo comprehensive assessments of physical and psychosocial functioning before and after a 16-week intervention. The study will examine the short- and longer- term impact of CST on psychological distress and quality of life as well as the effects of the intervention on morbidity, mortality, and medical costs over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop more effective ways to help patients with chronic lung disease and their caregivers cope more effectively with problematic symptoms, reduce distress, improve quality of life, enhance physical functioning, and increase survival.      Public Health Relevance: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant health problem in the United States and throughout the world, and is considered the fourth leading cause of death in the US. This study will examine the effects of an enhanced coping skills training program for COPD patients and their caregivers, delivered by telephone, on patients' psychosocial and physical functioning and long-term survival.          ",Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD,7817034,R01HL065503,"['Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Inpatients ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' Inequality ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Moods ', ' Morbidity -

"Neuroimaging and Behavioral Biomarkers for ADHD in Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area 03: Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and the specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent behavioral disorder of childhood affecting about 6 million school children and perhaps 10 million adults in the US. ADHD is however a very controversial disorder. Some critics question its validity, others argue that the criteria are too broad, too subjective, or not developmentally sensitive. Pediatric bipolar disorder is an even more controversial diagnosis, associated with widespread disparity between experts in criteria and prevalence rates. The aim of this Challenge Grant is to rigorously test our preliminary findings identifying three potential biomarkers. Two of these appear to be markers for ADHD that had perfect accuracy in discriminating between children with ADHD and controls in limited samples. However, these studies only included boys aged 9 - 12 who met criteria for Combined Subtype, and had been previously treated with methylphenidate (MPH). It is critical to ascertain if these findings can be replicated in an independent sample, extended to girls, older and younger individuals, to all ADHD subtypes, and to ADHD subjects with no prior history of psychotropic treatment. The third marker appears to identify children with bipolar disorder, and in a sample of 103 subjects distinguished bipolar from ADHD and controls with 94% sensitivity and specificity. Bipolar children in this sample met strict operational criteria for DSM-IV bipolar disorder. Hence, we propose to rigorously evaluate three potential biomarkers that address two severe but overlapping challenges. On one hand, there is the challenge of identifying where normal ends and where ADHD begins. On the other hand, there is the challenge of determining whether hyperactive, disruptive, aggressive and emotionally labile children have ADHD, bipolar disorder, both, or something entirely different. The first biomarker emerged from a state-of-the-art non-linear analysis of head movements and positional stability. The maximum Lyapunov exponent discriminated 62 ADHD children from 62 matched controls with perfect accuracy (ROC = 1.0). The second marker is a measure of regional T2-relaxation time (T2RT) in left putamen and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The third marker is a composite of actigraph measures of sleep, daytime hyperactivity and circadian dysregulation. Children with DSM-IV bipolar disorder had greater impairments in sleep and circadian rhythmicity than children with ADHD and comorbid mood disorders. The validity of these potential markers will be tested in a mixed gender sample of 160 children (80 ADHD, 40 bipolar, 40 control) between 6-17 years of age (n=80 neuroimaging). Identifying markers that distinguish ADHD from normal and ADHD from bipolar could have an enormous impact on the field. These findings (if further validated) can lead to a revamping of clinical criteria, and rapidly advance research into the genetics, etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of ADHD and pediatric bipolar disorder. This Challenge Grant is designed to test the validity of two potential biomarkers that in preliminary studies distinguished boys with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from controls with complete accuracy. A third biomarker will also be studied that distinguished children with bipolar disorder from subjects with ADHD and healthy normal controls with 94% sensitivity and specificity. These markers will be assessed in 160 children (6-17 years of age) from both genders. Eighty subjects will have ADHD, 40 bipolar disorder, and 40 will be healthy controls.               This Challenge Grant is designed to test the validity of two potential biomarkers that in preliminary studies distinguished boys with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from controls with complete accuracy.

"Musculoskeletal Disorders and Health Behaviors among US Workers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) include a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative conditions and they constitute a major proportion of all reported and/or compensable work-related diseases contributing to substantial numbers of lost work days and medical care utilization in the United States. MSDs have multiple and inter-connected risk factors, both occupational and non-occupational, such as repetitive trauma, obesity, smoking, and physical activity. While the relationship between MSDs and work-related injuries has been comprehensively characterized, examination of worker health behaviors using a large nationally representative population database has not been studied. Using the 1997-2007 National Health Interview Survey and the 1996-2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey the following Specific Aims and Hypotheses will be examined: 1. Document and compare the prevalence, trends, and geographical variation of specific musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) for all US workers, youth workers and older workers by occupation/industry, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. 2. Assess the relationship between worker health behaviors (physical activity patterns, obesity, alcohol use, and tobacco exposure) with reported musculoskeletal disorders by occupation and National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Industry sector. 3. Estimate the health-related quality of life effects of having musculoskeletal disorders using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYS) by occupation and NORA Industry sector. Examining the under-explored associations between US Worker occupation, health behaviors (physical activity patterns, obesity, and tobacco exposure), health-related quality of life, economic impact and geographical location of musculoskeletal disorders is paramount to our understanding of their current and potential future impact on the health care and public health systems. As older adults remain in or re-enter the workforce in the coming years, worksite-based health promotion of ergonomic and musculoskeletal disorders will become an increasingly important venue for reaching older and newly entering working adults. Although little research has been completed in this area, it is the goal of this Minority F31 Application to examine these associations that inform workplace strategies to meet the unique needs of worker populations at-risk for musculoskeletal disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a non-traditional degree seeking DO/PhD student, my overall career goal is to develop into a well-rounded physician-scientist. I am interested in developing a career in musculoskeletal epidemiology with a particular focus on ergonomic and occupational risk factors including health-related quality of life measures. As an epidemiologist, I am also interested in the development of primary and secondary prevention programs to increase awareness of the rheumatic contributions to the morbidity and mortality of musculoskeletal disorders. The Kirschstein-NRSA F31 Individual Fellowship for Minority students will serve as a platform for me to develop a productive career in academic rheumatology and epidemiology, with an emphasis on investigating factors that are associated with musculoskeletal disorders in large populations. During this fellowship, with the assistance of my mentors, Drs Lora Fleming, David Lee and Robert Hoffman, I will garner many valuable skills and applications of epidemiology and musculoskeletal disorders. First, I will learn how to use data from large publically available datasets to examine musculoskeletal disorders. Secondly, I will learn to reconstruct data, select pertinent variables, and conduct data analyses using advanced statistical software packages. Lastly, I will develop an in-depth knowledge of occupational health and musculoskeletal disorders from both a clinical and epidemiologic point of view. This NRSA minority student fellowship training will enable me to expand my knowledge and skills needed in the fields of musculoskeletal and occupational epidemiology.           ",Musculoskeletal

"Harvard/Brown Anxiety Program (HARP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental health conditions in the United States. Substantial gaps exist in the literature with respect to the clinical course of anxiety disorders in particular groups of individuals who are continually increasing in prevalence in the U.S. population, particularly African American and Hispanic individuals, and individuals entering older age. Specifically, despite the increasing and substantial number of African American, Hispanic, and older adults in the population, there are no published data on the clinical course of anxiety disorders in these groups of individuals that have been collected using a prospective, short-interval interview, longitudinal, naturalistic design. In this application we propose two timely and needed studies within the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Program (HARP) to address these fundamental gaps in our understanding of the course of anxiety disorders in these understudied populations. First, we propose to expand our newly recruited and prospectively studied sample of African Americans and Hispanics with anxiety disorders to a total of 175 African Americans and 175 Hispanics, and to recruit a contemporaneous sample of 175 non-Hispanic Caucasians, comparable on socioeconomic indicators to the African American and Hispanic samples. The recruitment and prospective, short-interval follow-up of these individuals over the next 5 years will provide the first comprehensive description of the prospective naturalistic course of psychopathology and psychosocial outcomes associated with DSM-IV anxiety disorders and related culture-bound syndromes and symptoms in African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects that are comparable on socioeconomic indicators (AIM 1), as well as examination of predictors of course within each of these three ethnic groups (AIM 2). We will then conduct the first prospective longitudinal test of potential ethnic minority disparities in the course of anxiety disorders (AIM 3) along with the first examination of potential demographic, clinical, environmental stressor, and socio-cultural predictors of ethnic minority disparities in course (AIM 4). Second, we propose to continue observation of members of the original HARP cohort who have been studied for 15 years as they enter older adulthood (all 247 subjects who will reach or exceed the age of 61 during the proposed grant period) to provide new knowledge about the developmental changes that take place in the clinical course of anxiety disorders during the transition to older adulthood (AIMS 5 and 6). We will test the suggestion in the literature, based on epidemiological data, that the course of anxiety disorders improves during the transition to older adulthood; explore the extent to which indicators of declining physical and social wellness may be predictive of worsening course of anxiety disorders as subjects make the transition to older adulthood; and test the hypothesis that those individuals who have had an especially pernicious course of anxiety are at increased risk for age-related cognitive impairment. Taken together, this proposal will provide substantial new clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in understudied individuals in the population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the increasing numbers of both ethnic minorities and individuals entering older age in the United States, there is a dearth of substantial clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, including factors which place them at substantial risk for deleterious health consequences. This project will provide necessary in-depth prospective longitudinal study of the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, and holds promise for providing insight into the factors associated with the medical, psychological, and economic consequences of anxiety disorders in ethnic minorities and aging populations.           PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE (2-3 sentences) Despite the increasing numbers of both ethnic minorities and individuals entering older age in the United States, there is a dearth of substantial clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, including factors which place them at substantial risk for deleterious health consequences.

"Cross-Cultural Comparison of Interactions Between Anxious Mothers and Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this training grant is to promote positive youth development in Latino youths by examining parenting practices that place youths at heightened risk for developing anxiety. Long-term, this will allow the candidate to tailor interventions to better serve diverse families and reduce mental health disparity. Training goals for this fellowship are to equip the candidate with (a) understanding of the interplay between family processes, culture, and youth outcome, (b) skills to develop innovative, culturally-appropriate anxiety interventions, (c) capacity to conduct rigorous investigations using sound research design and quantitative methods. These goals will be met through mentorship from leading researchers and coursework completion. The training plan will culminate in the completion of the proposed original project. This cross-sectional case-control study will examine observed interactions between mothers (N = 60; 30 Non-Hispanic White, 30 Mexican American) with an anxiety disorder diagnosis and their children (ages 8-14) to examine cross- cultural differences in parenting behaviors (e.g., control, autonomy-granting, criticism, warmth, anxiety- modeling) and their associations with youth psychological symptoms and functioning. Specific aims are to (1) examine cultural differences in observed parenting behaviors of anxious mothers, (2) specify associations between parenting behaviors and youth mental health outcomes, and (3) assess potential moderators of the relationship between observed parenting behaviors and youth symptoms, including ethnicity and child perception of parenting. Anxiety is the most prevalent mental health problem in the U.S. in adults and youths. Anxiety is more highly prevalent in Hispanic populations, who are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the U.S. Anxiety interferes with youths' abilities to reach their full adult potential by negatively impacting social relationships, school achievement, and psychological well-being. Parenting behaviors are often implicated in the development of youth anxiety; however, behaviors of anxious Mexican Americans, who place different cultural value on practices such as parental control, have not been examined. Therefore, this study is of high theoretical and public health importance. This project is an initial step toward identifying culture-specific parent behaviors that place youths at high-risk for developing internalizing disorders and that may serve to transmit anxiety from parent to child. It will lay the groundwork for future development of culturally- appropriate child anxiety preventive interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My long-term career goal is to increase the efficiency of interventions for youths and families with early onset anxiety problems and to aid in the customization of treatment to ethnic minority groups to reduce racial mental health disparity. Anxiety is prevalent, distressing, and disabling, and its treatment and prevention will enhance the likelihood that youths will lead healthy lives, free from disorder and disability. Previous research indicates that parental psychopathology may play a large role in both the development and maintenance of youth anxiety, as well as for the n of interventions. Specific parenting behaviors have been implicated, however, little is known about how these findings may generalize to other cultural groups. A major unexplored area is the potentially different parenting practices of anxious mothers across cultures.           ",Cross-Cultural Comparison of Interactions Between Anxious Mothers and Children,8088120,F31HD062272,"['Cross-Cultural Comparison ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Friendships ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' early onset ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mothers ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Life ', ' sound ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Investigation ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,41380,-0.0015698412140294946
"Conduct Disorder & Depression in Girls:  Precursors, Development and Comorbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive interventions depend in large part on the availability of reliable and specific information about the development of psychopathology. Three of the priority areas for clinical research identified in the 2007/2008 NIMH Strategic Plan are the 1) prediction of individuals at risk for developing disease; 2) personalization of knowledge about individual biological, environmental and social factors to better personalize interventions; and 3) participation of the diversity of people and settings in clinical research The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), a large-scale (n=2,451), longitudinal study of a representative, urban sample of African American and European American girls, is uniquely poised to illuminate each of these topic areas as they pertain to Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): two disorders that generate the greatest amount of morbidity among adolescent females and contribute the largest portion to the global burden of disease among women (Murray & Lopez. 1997). In particular, the PGS aims to predict female CD and MDD by building developmental models of risk and protection from the early identification of individual vulnerabilities that serve as childhood precursors to disorders, and the contexts in which such vulnerabilities are more likely to lead to disorder, by operationalizing sub-syndromal phenotypes of disorders, and by examining developmental changes in the pattern of comorbid conditions. Prediction will be based on multiple annual assessments of this racially and economically diverse sample with high rates of participant retention (average of 94 percent over 7 waves). Thus far, we have generated data on the onset, stability and developmental course of DSM-IV symptoms for CD and MDD and a broad range of other disorders. We also have assessed potential moderating and mediating factors on the development of symptomatology in girls. We are seeking funds to continue this prospective study through adolescence with five annual assessments of the girls and their mothers and fathers. The girls will be aged 13-16 in wave 1, and aged 17-20 years in wave 5. The planned assessments, when linked to the developmental data already collected during childhood, will elucidate precursors to CD and MDD in adolescence, their sub-syndromal phenotypes, common patterns of comorbidity, and risk, promotive and protective factors associated with transitions from precursor, to sub-syndrome, to disorder, and to comorbid disorders. The study is relevant for understanding ethnic disparities in the manifestation of CD and MDD and can serve as a building block for personalized, preventive and remedial treatments to be developed for specific subgroups of girls at risk of CD, MDD, their co-occurrence, and comorbidity with other disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood. The study also examines family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors that increase or reduce these risks. The diversity of the participants in this community sample (e.g. equal numbers of African American and European American girls, broad range of income levels) will allow information to be gathered about early and ongoing risks and problems that are more important for different subgroups, which can serve as building blocks for screening devices and the prevention of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems.           Project narrative The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood. The study also examines family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors that increase or reduce these risks. The diversity of the participants in this community sample (e.g. equal numbers of African American and European American girls, broad range of income levels) will allow information to be gathered about early and ongoing risks and problems that are more important for different subgroups, which can serve as building blocks for screening devices and the prevention of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems.","Conduct Disorder & Depression in Girls:  Precursors, Development and Comorbidity",8078320,R01MH056630,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Dysthymic Disorder ', ' dysthymia ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' early onset ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' European ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Maps ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity -

"Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Comprehensive hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) received their first federal funding from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration in 1975. Regional networks developed enabling and strengthening intra- and inter-state cooperation and collaboration. In 1995, the CDC provided direct funding to the twelve hemophilia regions following a Congressional mandate to monitor blood product safety and hemophilia disease progression, including arthropathy. During the past ten years funds from the Hematologic Disease Branch has assisted Region X (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington) with building center and regional infrastructure including expanded data collection capabilities for surveillance. Funds have also enhanced inter-regional collaboration in the US West. The Universal Data and Serum Specimen collection System for Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders has been enrolling participants since 1997/98 and has provided a robust data bank. During the next five years, Region X in collaboration with other federal regions will begin more focused public health research with the hemophilia and bleeding disorders community that may be extrapolated to other populations with chronic conditions and diagnoses. Region X is an area of the United States with urban, rural and frontier counties. The majority of the population in this region lives north of the 45th parallel. The region also has an incidence of obesity and overweight in hemophilia patients and the general region that mirrors the national averages. The Region X research interests include: 1) whether the health disparities experienced by rural and frontier citizens also extends to persons with bleeding disorders or does care for a bleeding disorder provided by HTCs decrease the health disparities; 2) whether persons living in counties without physicians and/or hospitals have poorer physical and health outcomes compared to others with similar diagnosis, especially persons with milder severity; 3) the impact of less ambient vitamin D on joint disease and bone health/density; and 4) the relationship between perceived ability to engage in activity, actual level of activity, unemployment due to disability, pain and quality of life.          ",Prevention of Complications of Hemophilia Through HTCs,7895823,U01DD000200,[''],NCBDDD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2010,214895,0.0226254381967386
"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this program is to prevent complications of hemophilia and other bleeding disorders through assessment, surveillance, outreach, education, consultation, and management. A regional network of ten hemophilia treatment centers in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee will be coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. In 2005, Region IV-North (comprising nine hemophilia treatment centers [HTCs] in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee) had a total of 1,848 active patients with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. Hemophilia patients constitute 61.5% of the total patients, while 27.6% have von Willebrand disease and 10.9% have other bleeding disorders. In 2005, there were 380 active female patients, an increase of 25.2% over the 2004 total. Almost 22% of the active patients are from ethnic minority groups, with an explosive increase in Hispanics. In comparison to U.S. averages, there are higher poverty rates and lower educational levels within the region, predisposing individuals to suboptimal behaviors in relation to diet, exercise, and use of health care services. The network will collaborate with regional lay organizations and the four non-federally funded centers in the region to deliver appropriately tailored prevention messages aimed at reducing complications of bleeding disorders and improving health across the lifespan, with the intention of attaining and measuring specific outcomes to reduce complications. Further, the region will redouble its outreach to underserved populations, such as women and minorities, to integrate them into the HTC system. All of these efforts will be systematically evaluated to assess their efficacy. Surveillance of patients enrolled in the CDC's Universal Data Collection (UDC) project, which has collected samples and data from over 18,000 individuals nationally since 1998, will continue in order to monitor the safety of the blood supply. The network will also expand upon the UDC program to collect data that could be used for clinical research projects leading to improved health outcomes for individuals with bleeding disorders, accelerated adoption of healthy behaviors, the reduction or elimination of health disparities among various ethnic and racial groups and between genders, and the achievement of greater efficiency in the core public health infrastructure.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorder Through HTCs,7895782,U01DD000199,[''],NCBDDD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2010,456667,0.04356228954973102
"First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cannabis use in adolescence and young adulthood is very common in the United States. Accumulating evidence suggests that, unlike other illicit drugs, cannabis used in adolescence may be a causal risk factor for schizophrenia, and cannabis use affects the symptoms, course, and outcomes of the illness. The proposed research seeks to clarify the impact of cannabis use on the age at onset of prodromal symptoms (e.g., decline in functioning, difficulties concentrating, irritability, and sleep disturbances that precede psychosis), the age at onset of psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucinations and delusions), and the nature of negative, cognitive, neurological, and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The study also will determine whether or not a previously characterized gene-environment interaction} involving the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and pre-onset cannabis use} influences onset ages and symptomatology. The study involves hospitalized patients with a first episode of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, most of whom are African American. This population is of particular relevance given well-recognized ongoing healthcare disparities across ethnic groups, under-representation of African Americans in clinical research, underuse of mental health services by African Americans, and very high rates of cannabis use in this population. The specific aims of the research are: (1) to clarify the effects of cannabis use on disease onset by studying (a) age at onset of prodromal symptoms and (b) age at onset of psychotic symptoms in first-episode patients who used cannabis in the years prior to onset as well as those who did not; (2) to study the impact of cannabis use on disease phenomenology (i.e., symptoms, cognitive deficits, neurological signs) by comparing the clinical characteristics of first-episode patients who used cannabis prior to hospitalization with those who did not; and (3) to elucidate the impact of a specific gene-environment interaction on disease onset and disease phenomenology by investigating the effects of the COMT Val158Met functional polymorphism genotype, cannabis use, and their interaction on onset ages and symptom profiles of first-episode patients. The research will be conducted using extensive cross-sectional assessments of hospitalized first-episode patients whose data will be supplemented by information from family members/informants. Thorough and psychometrically sound instruments will be used to retrospectively assess past substance use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because schizophrenia can be such a devastating illness, efforts to better understand modifiable determinants of course and outcomes are crucial. Innovative aspects of this research that make it especially relevant and innovative include: (1) testing of focused hypotheses will be tested related to a specific recently discovered gene-environment interaction, (2) reliance on a predominantly African American sample, a group that is under- represented in psychiatric research despite a high prevalence of key risk factors, (3) the preventive implications related to future potential enhancements of outcomes by reducing cannabis use among adolescents who are at especially high risk, (4) measurement of all past use of all substances thoroughly and carefully, allowing for examination of potential interactions among the key variables being studied, and (5) the use of Ancestry-Informative Markers in the genetic analysis to control for potential effects of admixture and population stratification.          ",First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use,7851517,R01MH081011,"['Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Reliance ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' instrument ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophreniform Disorder ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory ', ' Pattern ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' Catechol O-Methyltransferase ', ' EC 2.1.1.6 ', ' Catechol Methyltransferase ', ' valylvaline ', ' Val-Val ', ' L-valyl-L-valine ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Cannabis ', ' Hemp Plant ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 12 year old ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 14 year old ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Delusions ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Methyltransferase Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' informant ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' Hallucinations ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Measurement ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,360365,0.06097426936024205
"Early Social Communication Characteristics of ASD in Diverse Cultures in the US a There is a pressing need to improve early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) so that families can access intensive, appropriate intervention services as early as possible. However, studies indicate that important racial and ethnic disparities exist in the identification and diagnosis of children with ASD in the US, which impact access to services. Very little research is available on ASD from developing countries. This research investigation is a foundational study of early social communication markers of ASD in children from two diverse cultures from two different countries- Latino immigrants in Southeastern US and the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province of South Africa. These two regions were selected to inform future epidemiological research on ASD in diverse populations both in the US and other developing countries. Children in this study will range from 18 to 36 months of age. This study will use an observational case-control research design to compare early behavioral markers of ASD in 15 children who end up with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD from a predominantly Latino immigrant population in Collier County, Florida in the southeastern US (ASD-US1), 15 young African children from KZN who end up with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (ASD-Africa), and matched control children from Leon County, Florida, who have been diagnosed with ASD by the FIRST WORDS(R) Project (ASD-US2). The three groups of children with ASD will be compared to groups of typically developing (TD) children from each site (TD-US1, TD-Africa, TD- US2). Children will be recruited with autism-specific screening tools adapted for these low-resource settings. We will first conduct a series of focus groups to adapt the screening and diagnostic tools to be culturally appropriate and to understand the influence of culture on expectations of children and understanding of disabilities including ASD. Social communication markers of ASD will be compared during two different video recorded observation methods-structured observations using systematic sampling procedures and naturalistic observations of everyday activities. A clinical diagnosis of ASD based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria will be confirmed or ruled out by experienced clinicians using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. These findings will provide information about the relationship between culture and ASD in order to advance science on the heterogeneity of ASD and have important implications for informing research on genetic and environmental mechanisms of ASD. This research study is pivotal to our long term aims of adapting screening and diagnostic tools for epidemiological research and strengthening in-country and global collaboration to build the capacity in low-resource settings for appropriate accessible early intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The expected outcomes of this study will have significance for the field by identifying behavioral markers that distinguish young Latino children in the Southeastern US and African children from KwaZulu-Natal with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from children with typical development from those cultures. It is important to investigate the relationship between culture and ASD in order to advance science on the heterogeneity of ASD. Cultural differences may be evident in the behavioral phenotype of ASD, recognition and interpretation of symptoms by caregivers, the decisions parents make regarding evaluation and treatment, and interactions between families and the healthcare system. The results of this research will lead to culturally sensitive screening and evaluation methods that may decrease the age at which all children with ASD are diagnosed.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The expected outcomes of this study will have significance for the field by identifying behavioral markers that distinguish young Latino children in the Southeastern US and African children from KwaZulu-Natal with ASD from children with typical development from those cultures.

"Appraisal Delay and Disparities in Timely Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality have been well-documented for racial/ethnic minorities. These disparities persist despite widespread and targeted cancer education, screening campaigns, and advancements in cancer therapy. Diagnostic delay is significantly and negatively associated with cancer patient outcomes. Substantial barriers to early detection and diagnosis include lower rates of screening by minorities and access issues due to lack of health insurance. Later detection of cancer, however, is not solely explained by structural barriers to obtaining health care. Evidence has accumulated that cultural and communication factors may play a role in outcome disparities caused by late detection. Appraisal delay occurs when patients fail to recognize or interpret symptoms they are experiencing as requiring medical attention. This can ultimately result in short or lengthy delays in making a diagnosis of cancer. We posit that factors that influence the perception and interpretation of symptoms may impede an earlier cancer diagnosis in racial and ethnic minorities and that these factors may further hamper communication between physicians and patients once patients actually present symptoms to their health care provider. The goal of this study is to examine how appraisal delay impedes the reporting of symptoms to their health care providers. We also hypothesize that these patients will have more difficulty effectively communicating these symptoms to their physicians during the clinical encounter. To accomplish this goal, we will interview recently diagnosed colon cancer patients using a semi-structured interview instrument to identify their interpretations and reporting of the symptoms that were indicative of colon cancer to confidantes and their health care providers. Time to delay between patient report of symptoms to their primary care providers and diagnosis (clinical diagnostic delay) will be validated by chart review. African- American men and women and white male and female patients with newly diagnosed colon cancer will be compared. The study's specific aims are: 1) Determine if appraisal delay and clinical diagnostic delay are associated with race/ethnicity and gender and examine factors that subsequently moderate this relationship; 2) Assess the communications between patients and their health care providers about symptom reporting; and 3) Use the results of this study to clarify the need for a communication study using direct observation methods to determine whether and how the communication process between patients and primary care providers contribute to diagnostic delay by communicating differently with patients by race and gender when they present pre-diagnosis symptoms of cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project can improve understanding of the barriers to early diagnosis of cancer and lead to interventions that can help patients understand their symptoms, communicate them more effectively to their health care providers, and ultimately lead to earlier cancer diagnoses and better outcomes.          ",Appraisal Delay and Disparities in Timely Cancer Diagnosis,7880804,R01CA134280,"['Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communication ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medical attention ', ' public health relevance ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cognitive ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Trust ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' Breast ', ' Structure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,478554,0.09156906606428594

"Antipsychotics and Vascular Function in Bipolar Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application requests funding to support the training and research activities for Dr. Jess G. Fiedorowicz. His goal is to develop expertise in human cardiovascular physiology for the assessment of vascular function in patients with bipolar disorder. Vascular function represents an important intermediate phenotype in the development of atherosclerosis and has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Bipolar disorders are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The first-line, second- generation antipsychotics associated with weight gain (SGAWGs: risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) have been associated with significant metabolic complications, which may increase risk for vascular disease. Assessment of vascular function may allow identification of clinically relevant mechanisms for the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with bipolar disorder. This research and training plan strongly emphasizes interdisciplinary and translational research as outlined by the NIH Roadmap.  As a psychiatrist, Dr. Fiedorowicz seeks additional training in translational research applications in human vascular physiology and pharmacology, related statistical methodologies, and the ethical conduct and design of research. The research plan proposes a 26-week, prospective, naturalistic cohort study to examine the relationship of SGAWG use and vascular function in bipolar disorders by studying incident users of SGAWGs and non-users of antipsychotics with bipolar disorders. The primary aim of this study is to determine the magnitude and timeline of antipsychotic-induced changes in vascular function in incident users of SGAWGs. The methodology employed will allow for mechanistic investigation with particular focus on insulin resistance and visceral obesity. This application will provide a foundation for Dr. Fiedorowicz' long-term scientific goal of creating an independent program of interdisciplinary research addressing cardiovascular disease in bipolar disorders and the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychotropic medications.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals with bipolar disorder bear an excess risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Some medications used to treat bipolar disorder may worsen risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

"Hormones & Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist- clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child- bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute, Each of four Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women or the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education and development of junior investigators who would commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-specific treatment approaches and public awareness as to the importance of these sex-specific health issues for families and society.           ",Hormones & Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside,7980610,K12HD051959,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Data ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Genes ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Ovarian ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Training ', ' Israel ', ' Sexual Development ', ' sex development ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Massachusetts ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Staging ', ' Puberty ', ' human puberty ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Societies ', ' programs ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Endocrine ', ' interest ', ' Biology ', ' Medical center ', ' Breast ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' reproductive ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' next generation ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' translational approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2010,607215,0.07556006098048261
"Appraisal and Diagnostic Delay in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality have been well-documented for racial/ethnic minorities. These disparities persist despite widespread and targeted cancer education, screening campaigns, and advancements in cancer therapy. Diagnostic delay is significantly and negatively associated with cancer patient outcomes. Substantial barriers to early detection and diagnosis include lower rates of screening by minorities and access issues due to lack of health insurance. Later detection of cancer, however, is not solely explained by structural barriers to obtaining health care. Evidence has accumulated that cultural and communication factors may play a role in outcome disparities caused by late detection. We propose to examine two important factors that are likely to contribute to a delay in the diagnosis of cancer. First, `appraisal delay', defined as patients' inability to identify, interpret, and bring symptoms to the attention of their physicians. Second, 'diagnostic delay', defined as physicians' inaction or incorrect actions to make a diagnosis. We will examine how diagnostic delay may be associated with an inability to understand, interpret, and communicate effectively with patients. The overall goal of this study is to understand how these factors contribute to delay in detecting cancers in African-Americans, using colon cancer as a paradigm for this phenomenon. The study's specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Identify and examine the factors that influence appraisal delay, e.g., patients' recognition, perception, and response to pre-diagnosis cancer symptoms. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 144 recently diagnosed colon cancer patients to identify their interpretations of the symptoms that eventually result in a diagnosis of cancer. African-American and white cancer patients will be compared. Aim 2. Test whether or not primary care physicians (PCPs) communicate with patients who present pre-diagnosis symptoms of cancer to PCPs differently depending on patient race and gender. To accomplish this, we will use an experimental design to compare the communication patterns and subsequent patient management decisions of a sample of 110 PCPs who will each meet with four unannounced trained patient simulators representing 4 gender-race combinations.This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians. The study's main goal is to improve understanding of the barriers to early diagnosis of cancer, lead to interventions that can help doctors and patients communicate more effectively, and ultimately lead to earlier cancer diagnoses.      Public Health Relevance: This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians.

"Treatment Response in Ethnic Minority Individuals With Binge Eating Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Binge eating disorder (BED) is prevalent in the United States and is associated with serious distress and impairment. Recent data suggest that BED, unlike other eating disorders, is as likely to be diagnosed among African American and Hispanic/Latino Americans as among Caucasians, and health problems associated with BED may disproportionately affect minority ethnic/racial groups. Although a sizable number of clinical trials of psychotherapy for BED have been conducted, no individual clinical trials have included individuals from minority ethnic groups in sufficient numbers to allow for ethnic/racial group comparisons. This study proposes to conduct a preliminary investigation of symptom presentation and psychosocial treatment response among African American and Hispanic/Latino subjects with BED through the re-analysis of existing data. We propose to aggregate data from multiple trials of psychosocial treatments of BED to produce the power necessary to compare ethnic groups and examine correlates of severity and outcome. We have created a willing network of investigators who have conducted randomized clinical trials for the treatment of BED in the United States since 1995. Preliminary data analysis indicates that the aggregation of available clinical trial data should yield data for N = 107 African American and N = 53 Hispanic/Latino treatment trial participants, as well N > 800 Caucasian participants. The aims of the current study will be (1) to compare baseline symptomatology in treatment-seeking subjects from African American and Hispanic/Latino backgrounds (including body mass index (BMI), rates of binge eating, cognitive eating disorder symptoms, and associated depression and anxiety) to that of Caucasian participants in trials of BED, to examine the associations of SES with severity in these groups, and to examine the characteristics of treatment-seeking subjects relative to two non-treatment seeking epidemiological samples; (2) to compare drop out, improvement, and recovery of subjects with African American and Hispanic/Latino backgrounds to that of Caucasian participants in trials of BED and examine the interrelationships of race/ethnicity and other predictors such as pre-treatment severity, BMI, SES, and depression, and their relative impact on outcome. This study will provide important data to address health disparities in this area, including issues in treatment access and treatment outcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to study binge eating disorder symptomatology and treatment response among African American and Hispanic/Latinos who have participated in psychotherapy trials for treatments of this disorder as binge eating disorder is the most prevalent eating disorder in the United States, and it appears to be equally prevalent in African American and Hispanic/Latino groups in the United States as in Caucasian groups. Preliminary data also suggest it is equally prevalent among sub-groups of those from minority ethnic/racial groups defined by country of origin, acculturation status, and other factors. Although African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos suffer as much as or more from binge eating disorder, obesity, and physical health issues linked to obesity, they are less likely to receive treatment for binge eating disorder and this study will attempt to define and understand health disparities in this area, and assess the relative impact of socioeconomic and related mental health factors in minority ethnic/racial and Caucasian subjects.           This application proposes to study binge eating disorder symptomatology and treatment response among African American and Hispanic/Latinos who have participated in psychotherapy trials for treatments of this disorder as binge eating disorder is the most prevalent eating disorder in the United States, and it appears to be equally prevalent in African American and Hispanic/Latino groups in the United States as in Caucasian groups.

"Conduct Disorder & Depression in Girls:  Precursors, Development and Comorbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive interventions depend in large part on the availability of reliable and specific information about the development of psychopathology. Three of the priority areas for clinical research identified in the 2007/2008 NIMH Strategic Plan are the 1) prediction of individuals at risk for developing disease; 2) personalization of knowledge about individual biological, environmental and social factors to better personalize interventions; and 3) participation of the diversity of people and settings in clinical research The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), a large-scale (n=2,451), longitudinal study of a representative, urban sample of African American and European American girls, is uniquely poised to illuminate each of these topic areas as they pertain to Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): two disorders that generate the greatest amount of morbidity among adolescent females and contribute the largest portion to the global burden of disease among women (Murray & Lopez. 1997). In particular, the PGS aims to predict female CD and MDD by building developmental models of risk and protection from the early identification of individual vulnerabilities that serve as childhood precursors to disorders, and the contexts in which such vulnerabilities are more likely to lead to disorder, by operationalizing sub-syndromal phenotypes of disorders, and by examining developmental changes in the pattern of comorbid conditions. Prediction will be based on multiple annual assessments of this racially and economically diverse sample with high rates of participant retention (average of 94 percent over 7 waves). Thus far, we have generated data on the onset, stability and developmental course of DSM-IV symptoms for CD and MDD and a broad range of other disorders. We also have assessed potential moderating and mediating factors on the development of symptomatology in girls. We are seeking funds to continue this prospective study through adolescence with five annual assessments of the girls and their mothers and fathers. The girls will be aged 13-16 in wave 1, and aged 17-20 years in wave 5. The planned assessments, when linked to the developmental data already collected during childhood, will elucidate precursors to CD and MDD in adolescence, their sub-syndromal phenotypes, common patterns of comorbidity, and risk, promotive and protective factors associated with transitions from precursor, to sub-syndrome, to disorder, and to comorbid disorders. The study is relevant for understanding ethnic disparities in the manifestation of CD and MDD and can serve as a building block for personalized, preventive and remedial treatments to be developed for specific subgroups of girls at risk of CD, MDD, their co-occurrence, and comorbidity with other disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood. The study also examines family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors that increase or reduce these risks. The diversity of the participants in this community sample (e.g. equal numbers of African American and European American girls, broad range of income levels) will allow information to be gathered about early and ongoing risks and problems that are more important for different subgroups, which can serve as building blocks for screening devices and the prevention of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems.           Project narrative The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood.

"Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Region IV South Bleeding Disorders Program is a network of nine federally funded Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs) that provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The Regional Core Center (RCC) office is located in Atlanta, Georgia and shares an office with Hemophilia of Georgia, Inc. The RCC emphasizes a pro-active orientation toward bleeding disorder care. This program will further the mission of the CDC in promoting heath and quality of life in persons with bleeding disorders by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability. The goals and objectives of this regional program were designed to reduce the complications and morbidity associated with bleeding disorders, as well as to promote access to integrated and family-centered services for individuals with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Comprehensive systems of care are necessary, as those receiving care outside of an HTC have a 60% higher mortality rate than those receiving care in federally funded HTCs (CDC). Objectives will focus on those patients from traditionally underserved populations. Prevention programs will strive to reduce the impact on the public health system by, for example, decreasing the number of days missed from work and school. The RCC will be responsible for program evaluation and monitoring through required affiliate reporting, data reports, assessment of Universal Data Collection (UDC) Project participation, site visits, needs assessments, and consumer input. Other specific project objectives include: (1) provide continuous screening for HIV and Hepatitis A, B, and C; (2) facilitate improved regional information management systems, data collection and evaluation; (3) expand the UDC cohort through recruitment of individuals with genetic bleeding disorders; (4) transition the national database to a web-based application; (5) expand the database with additional relevant date related to women's issues and other important clinical outcomes; and (6) address areas of concern unique to Region IV South regarding healthcare disparities. This hemophilia care program strives to improve the quality and years of healthy lives for those living with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Prevention and outreach efforts aimed at the traditionally underserved will eliminate the region's health disparities by providing quality healthcare services, regardless of an individual's race, ethnicity, age, or gender. Particular attention will be paid to the leading health indicators: physical activity, overweight and obesity, immunization and access to health care.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Bleeding Disorders Through Hemo Tmt Centers,7895819,U01DD000201,[''],NCBDDD,"HEMOPHILIA OF GEORGIA, INC.",U01,2010,342724,0.06722330882950252
"Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to prevent the complications of hemophilia and bleeding disorders through the expansion and acquisition of clinical data sets. These data sets will include both disease-specific and general-health related information. The data acquired will be used for proactive implementation of prevention programs throughout the network of multidisciplinary comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) throughout the United States. HTC's are designed to treat patients with hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand Disease and rare factor deficiencies. Utilizing the comprehensive care model, therapeutic interventions based on previously collected data and changes in therapy based on new research continues to enhance the care of the bleeding disorders community. Chronic genetic disorders often require complex and multidisciplinary care for optimal diagnosis, treatment and management. The consequences of bleeding disorders include severe medical, financial, vocational, psychological and familial repercussions when the condition is not properly managed. The lack of proper treatment has general public health consequences such as increased costs of care caused by increased hospital and emergency utilization and patient disability that may require welfare and other government entitlements. A regional approach to planning, coordination and allocation of funds is vital to ensure that services are available to treat this and other complicated bleeding disorders in Region II, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The proposed program will continue a national network of federally funded HTCs organized through 12 regional core centers and funded by the CDC. Aim 1: To provide comprehensive prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders directed at attaining and measuring specific outcomes through research and surveillance aimed at reducing complications using a multidisciplinary approach. Under this aim we propose to expand the cohort through continued recruitment and observation individuals with genetic bleeding disorders including hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand disease, rare bleeding disorders and women with bleeding disorders; and expand the current Universal Data and Serum Specimen Collection System (UDC) database to collect additional relevant data related to women's issues in coagulation, rare bleeding disorders, prophylaxis, factor utilization, inhibitors, genetic mutations, and other important clinical outcomes. We plan to design and pilot additional studies aimed at further characterizing the bleeding disorders population through the expanded access to a) gene-based diagnosis and b) more precise definition of the biochemical phenotype (e.g. global assays) with the ultimate goal of genotype - phenotype correlation; utilize the UDC BMI data to evaluate the cost impact on the health care system from conditions with weight-based dosing; test interventions that could facilitate weight loss; and design and pilot a study to evaluate effects of rising annual out- of-pocket expenses and co-payments on the use of elective/preventive services provided by the HTC. Aim 2: Maintain A Regional Network Of Comprehensive Prevention Services Through Hemophilia Treatment Centers to Persons With Hemophilia and Related Disorders Including Women, Minorities and the Underserved. Under this broad aim we will lay out our comprehensive, culturally sensitive, family-centered care services and their expansion, our communication within the region and administrative mechanisms. These include outreach and education, orientation and training programs, maintenance of appropriate management and evaluation systems, maintenance of a prevention evaluation network to assess the efficacy of prevention services by increasing the capacity for data collection, moving from paper to electronic and our participation in the coordinating committee. Our plan as stated will promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Many of our aims will facilitate reducing health disparities and accelerate the adoption of health behaviors while improving prevention effectiveness through cost-based studies. Some aims will be directly transferable to other chronic disease populations in the general public such as the evaluation of obesity and menorrhagia.          ",Prevention of the Complications of Hemophilia Thru Hemophilila Treatment Centers,7895758,U01DD000195,[''],NCBDDD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2010,589179,0.06925915048150486
"Cross-Cultural Comparison of Interactions Between Anxious Mothers and Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this training grant is to promote positive youth development in Latino youths by examining parenting practices that place youths at heightened risk for developing anxiety. Long-term, this will allow the candidate to tailor interventions to better serve diverse families and reduce mental health disparity. Training goals for this fellowship are to equip the candidate with (a) understanding of the interplay between family processes, culture, and youth outcome, (b) skills to develop innovative, culturally-appropriate anxiety interventions, (c) capacity to conduct rigorous investigations using sound research design and quantitative methods. These goals will be met through mentorship from leading researchers and coursework completion. The training plan will culminate in the completion of the proposed original project. This cross-sectional case-control study will examine observed interactions between mothers (N = 60; 30 Non-Hispanic White, 30 Mexican American) with an anxiety disorder diagnosis and their children (ages 8-14) to examine cross- cultural differences in parenting behaviors (e.g., control, autonomy-granting, criticism, warmth, anxiety- modeling) and their associations with youth psychological symptoms and functioning. Specific aims are to (1) examine cultural differences in observed parenting behaviors of anxious mothers, (2) specify associations between parenting behaviors and youth mental health outcomes, and (3) assess potential moderators of the relationship between observed parenting behaviors and youth symptoms, including ethnicity and child perception of parenting. Anxiety is the most prevalent mental health problem in the U.S. in adults and youths. Anxiety is more highly prevalent in Hispanic populations, who are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the U.S. Anxiety interferes with youths' abilities to reach their full adult potential by negatively impacting social relationships, school achievement, and psychological well-being. Parenting behaviors are often implicated in the development of youth anxiety; however, behaviors of anxious Mexican Americans, who place different cultural value on practices such as parental control, have not been examined. Therefore, this study is of high theoretical and public health importance. This project is an initial step toward identifying culture-specific parent behaviors that place youths at high-risk for developing internalizing disorders and that may serve to transmit anxiety from parent to child. It will lay the groundwork for future development of culturally- appropriate child anxiety preventive interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My long-term career goal is to increase the efficiency of interventions for youths and families with early onset anxiety problems and to aid in the customization of treatment to ethnic minority groups to reduce racial mental health disparity. Anxiety is prevalent, distressing, and disabling, and its treatment and prevention will enhance the likelihood that youths will lead healthy lives, free from disorder and disability. Previous research indicates that parental psychopathology may play a large role in both the development and maintenance of youth anxiety, as well as for the n of interventions. Specific parenting behaviors have been implicated, however, little is known about how these findings may generalize to other cultural groups. A major unexplored area is the potentially different parenting practices of anxious mothers across cultures.           ",Cross-Cultural Comparison of Interactions Between Anxious Mothers and Children,8126442,F31HD062272,"['ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' To specify ', ' Caucasians ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Process ', ' Work ', ' Research ', ' Health ', ' Communities ', ' Grant ', ' Goals ', ' Risk ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Prevention ', ' Play ', ' Training ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Schools ', ' Cognitive ', ' Investigation ', ' Sampling ', ' base ', ' Age ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Fellowship ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Foundations ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Methods ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Link ', ' Outcome ', ' Maintenance ', ' Affect ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Population ', ' success ', ' Area ', ' Modeling ', ' Parents ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Future ', ' skills ', ' Environment ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' early onset ', ' positive youth development ', ' Family Study ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mothers ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Emotional ', ' High Prevalence ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' psychosocial ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' sound ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Anxiety ', ' Mentorship ', ' Latino ', ' social ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Family ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Distress ', ' interest ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' disability ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' meetings ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' high risk ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Symptoms ', ' career ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Behavior ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Social Impacts ', ' cultural values ', ' Friendships ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Family Process ', ' Cross-Cultural Comparison ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2011,41800,-0.0015698412140294946
"Characterization of the PAD Symptom Experience    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic occlusive disease affecting more than 8 million Americans, a number expected to rise sharply due to an aging population. PAD causes insufficient blood flow to the legs, which leads to debilitating, activity-induced, ischemic pain (i.e. claudication). Although health care providers consider claudication the hallmark symptom of PAD, it is reported by less than 29% of PAD patients. When individuals report symptoms inconsistent with ""classic claudication,"" provider suspicion of disease presence is not triggered; therefore patients do not receive the necessary diagnostic testing and subsequent diagnosis. The breadth of PAD symptom experiences based on age and gender is poorly understood, but is a crucial component to providing timely diagnosis and treatment in an attempt to prevent amputation, heart attack, stroke, and death. Consistent with the scientific mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research to expand nursing science by integrating the biological and behavioral sciences, the proposed study utilizes a mixed methods approach to provide an integrated, comprehensive, and biobehavioral understanding of the PAD symptom experience. Subjective data will be obtained through in-depth interviews and symptom reports during treadmill walking. Objective, physiologic data related to ischemic changes in calf skeletal muscle will be obtained during treadmill walking. The objectives of the proposed descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional study are to elicit a comprehensive description of PAD symptoms and related physiologic data, and to determine the degree of correspondence to delineate causative mechanisms underlying symptoms (an NINR area of emphasis). This study will provide a comprehensive and accurate description of the subjective PAD symptom experience and will, for the first time, simultaneously evaluate subjective symptoms and objective physiologic ischemic changes in working skeletal muscles. This study has significant implications for the improvement of PAD assessment and diagnosis to optimize health by broadening currently accepted symptom descriptors, and to reduce health disparities by identifying age and gender differences in PAD symptom experiences. This study is foundational for future research to determine patterns of ischemia, their relationship to symptom report, and potential changes with therapeutic interventions, leading to the long term goal of developing and refining gender and age specific screening tools. The knowledge gained from this study has significant public health implications for the over 8 million undertreated, debilitated, and at-risk Americans that suffer daily from this painful, deadly, and life limiting disease--improving detection, diagnosis, and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 8 million Americans and places individuals at an increased risk for amputation, heart attack, stroke, and death. Current clinician diagnosis is primarily based on the presence of classic claudication, pain in the calf, thigh or buttock area that comes on with exercise and is easily relieved with rest. This study will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how older and younger men and women with PAD experience symptoms to increase PAD detection and provide timely treatment, improving the quality of life and life expectancy of individuals afflicted with PAD.             Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 8 million Americans and places individuals at an increased risk for amputation, heart attack, stroke, and death.

"Harvard/Brown Anxiety Program (HARP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental health conditions in the United States. Substantial gaps exist in the literature with respect to the clinical course of anxiety disorders in particular groups of individuals who are continually increasing in prevalence in the U.S. population, particularly African American and Hispanic individuals, and individuals entering older age. Specifically, despite the increasing and substantial number of African American, Hispanic, and older adults in the population, there are no published data on the clinical course of anxiety disorders in these groups of individuals that have been collected using a prospective, short-interval interview, longitudinal, naturalistic design. In this application we propose two timely and needed studies within the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Program (HARP) to address these fundamental gaps in our understanding of the course of anxiety disorders in these understudied populations. First, we propose to expand our newly recruited and prospectively studied sample of African Americans and Hispanics with anxiety disorders to a total of 175 African Americans and 175 Hispanics, and to recruit a contemporaneous sample of 175 non-Hispanic Caucasians, comparable on socioeconomic indicators to the African American and Hispanic samples. The recruitment and prospective, short-interval follow-up of these individuals over the next 5 years will provide the first comprehensive description of the prospective naturalistic course of psychopathology and psychosocial outcomes associated with DSM-IV anxiety disorders and related culture-bound syndromes and symptoms in African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects that are comparable on socioeconomic indicators (AIM 1), as well as examination of predictors of course within each of these three ethnic groups (AIM 2). We will then conduct the first prospective longitudinal test of potential ethnic minority disparities in the course of anxiety disorders (AIM 3) along with the first examination of potential demographic, clinical, environmental stressor, and socio-cultural predictors of ethnic minority disparities in course (AIM 4). Second, we propose to continue observation of members of the original HARP cohort who have been studied for 15 years as they enter older adulthood (all 247 subjects who will reach or exceed the age of 61 during the proposed grant period) to provide new knowledge about the developmental changes that take place in the clinical course of anxiety disorders during the transition to older adulthood (AIMS 5 and 6). We will test the suggestion in the literature, based on epidemiological data, that the course of anxiety disorders improves during the transition to older adulthood; explore the extent to which indicators of declining physical and social wellness may be predictive of worsening course of anxiety disorders as subjects make the transition to older adulthood; and test the hypothesis that those individuals who have had an especially pernicious course of anxiety are at increased risk for age-related cognitive impairment. Taken together, this proposal will provide substantial new clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in understudied individuals in the population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the increasing numbers of both ethnic minorities and individuals entering older age in the United States, there is a dearth of substantial clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, including factors which place them at substantial risk for deleterious health consequences. This project will provide necessary in-depth prospective longitudinal study of the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, and holds promise for providing insight into the factors associated with the medical, psychological, and economic consequences of anxiety disorders in ethnic minorities and aging populations.          PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE (2-3 sentences)  Despite the increasing numbers of both ethnic minorities and individuals entering older age in the United  States, there is a dearth of substantial clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in these  groups, including factors which place them at substantial risk for deleterious health consequences.

"Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing renewal application seeks to extend our previous work among patients with end stage lung disease to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, enhanced coping skills training (CST) protocol for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is an obstructive airway disease marked by symptoms of dyspnea, paroxysmal coughing, pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Approximately 12.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD and 70 percent of these cases represent individuals under the age of 65. COPD patients who are at an early stage of their disease often experience a progressive worsening of symptoms, while the advanced stages of the disease may be marked by frequent visits to the emergency department or inpatient hospitalizations for acute COPD exacerbations. Importantly, COPD also is a fatal condition for many patients, and is the fourth leading cause of preventable death for both men and women in the United States, with over 120,000 deaths reported in 2002. Although COPD is preventable (i.e., by not smoking), there is no cure for the disease and therefore the symptoms must be managed effectively. It has been well-established that brief, focused cognitive-behavioral therapy can significantly improve psychological function in medically ill persons, the wide geographic distribution of patients with COPD, along with their chronic exacerbations of illness, make face-to-face delivery of such therapy extremely difficult. Our previous work demonstrated that a telephone-based coping skills intervention (CST) with patients awaiting lung transplantation was effective in improving quality of life but did not improve physical functioning or survival. In that study, patients with COPD at an earlier stage of their disease process appeared to benefit most from CST. Thus, the present application proposes a larger, dual-site (Duke and Ohio State University), randomized trial among patients with COPD, using a comprehensive set of outcome measures over an extended follow-up period. Six hundred COPD patients will be randomly assigned to either a telephone-based enhanced, caregiver-assisted CST intervention or to a Usual care plus education and symptom monitoring Control group. Patients and their self-identified caregivers will undergo comprehensive assessments of physical and psychosocial functioning before and after a 16-week intervention. The study will examine the short- and longer- term impact of CST on psychological distress and quality of life as well as the effects of the intervention on morbidity, mortality, and medical costs over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop more effective ways to help patients with chronic lung disease and their caregivers cope more effectively with problematic symptoms, reduce distress, improve quality of life, enhance physical functioning, and increase survival.      Public Health Relevance: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant health problem in the United States and throughout the world, and is considered the fourth leading cause of death in the US. This study will examine the effects of an enhanced coping skills training program for COPD patients and their caregivers, delivered by telephone, on patients' psychosocial and physical functioning and long-term survival.

Three of the priority areas for clinical research identified in the 2007/2008 NIMH Strategic Plan are the 1) prediction of individuals at risk for developing disease; 2) personalization of knowledge about individual biological, environmental and social factors to better personalize interventions; and 3) participation of the diversity of people and settings in clinical research The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), a large-scale (n=2,451), longitudinal study of a representative, urban sample of African American and European American girls, is uniquely poised to illuminate each of these topic areas as they pertain to Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): two disorders that generate the greatest amount of morbidity among adolescent females and contribute the largest portion to the global burden of disease among women (Murray & Lopez. 1997). In particular, the PGS aims to predict female CD and MDD by building developmental models of risk and protection from the early identification of individual vulnerabilities that serve as childhood precursors to disorders, and the contexts in which such vulnerabilities are more likely to lead to disorder, by operationalizing sub-syndromal phenotypes of disorders, and by examining developmental changes in the pattern of comorbid conditions. Prediction will be based on multiple annual assessments of this racially and economically diverse sample with high rates of participant retention (average of 94 percent over 7 waves). Thus far, we have generated data on the onset, stability and developmental course of DSM-IV symptoms for CD and MDD and a broad range of other disorders. We also have assessed potential moderating and mediating factors on the development of symptomatology in girls. We are seeking funds to continue this prospective study through adolescence with five annual assessments of the girls and their mothers and fathers. The girls will be aged 13-16 in wave 1, and aged 17-20 years in wave 5. The planned assessments, when linked to the developmental data already collected during childhood, will elucidate precursors to CD and MDD in adolescence, their sub-syndromal phenotypes, common patterns of comorbidity, and risk, promotive and protective factors associated with transitions from precursor, to sub-syndrome, to disorder, and to comorbid disorders. The study is relevant for understanding ethnic disparities in the manifestation of CD and MDD and can serve as a building block for personalized, preventive and remedial treatments to be developed for specific subgroups of girls at risk of CD, MDD, their co-occurrence, and comorbidity with other disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood. The study also examines family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors that increase or reduce these risks. The diversity of the participants in this community sample (e.g. equal numbers of African American and European American girls, broad range of income levels) will allow information to be gathered about early and ongoing risks and problems that are more important for different subgroups, which can serve as building blocks for screening devices and the prevention of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems.           Project narrative The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood.

"Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing renewal application seeks to extend our previous work among patients with end stage lung disease to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, enhanced coping skills training (CST) protocol for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is an obstructive airway disease marked by symptoms of dyspnea, paroxysmal coughing, pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Approximately 12.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD and 70 percent of these cases represent individuals under the age of 65. COPD patients who are at an early stage of their disease often experience a progressive worsening of symptoms, while the advanced stages of the disease may be marked by frequent visits to the emergency department or inpatient hospitalizations for acute COPD exacerbations. Importantly, COPD also is a fatal condition for many patients, and is the fourth leading cause of preventable death for both men and women in the United States, with over 120,000 deaths reported in 2002. Although COPD is preventable (i.e., by not smoking), there is no cure for the disease and therefore the symptoms must be managed effectively. It has been well-established that brief, focused cognitive-behavioral therapy can significantly improve psychological function in medically ill persons, the wide geographic distribution of patients with COPD, along with their chronic exacerbations of illness, make face-to-face delivery of such therapy extremely difficult. Our previous work demonstrated that a telephone-based coping skills intervention (CST) with patients awaiting lung transplantation was effective in improving quality of life but did not improve physical functioning or survival. In that study, patients with COPD at an earlier stage of their disease process appeared to benefit most from CST. Thus, the present application proposes a larger, dual-site (Duke and Ohio State University), randomized trial among patients with COPD, using a comprehensive set of outcome measures over an extended follow-up period. Six hundred COPD patients will be randomly assigned to either a telephone-based enhanced, caregiver-assisted CST intervention or to a Usual care plus education and symptom monitoring Control group. Patients and their self-identified caregivers will undergo comprehensive assessments of physical and psychosocial functioning before and after a 16-week intervention. The study will examine the short- and longer- term impact of CST on psychological distress and quality of life as well as the effects of the intervention on morbidity, mortality, and medical costs over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop more effective ways to help patients with chronic lung disease and their caregivers cope more effectively with problematic symptoms, reduce distress, improve quality of life, enhance physical functioning, and increase survival.      Public Health Relevance: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant health problem in the United States and throughout the world, and is considered the fourth leading cause of death in the US. This study will examine the effects of an enhanced coping skills training program for COPD patients and their caregivers, delivered by telephone, on patients' psychosocial and physical functioning and long-term survival.          ",Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD,8109184,R01HL065503,"['chronic obstructive pulmonary disease education ', ' COPD education ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Physical assessment ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Inpatients ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Relaxation ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Physical Function ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' intervention effect ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' skills training ', ' Distress ', ' Moods ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' functional status ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' Coughing ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Chronic lung disease ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Expenditure ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' randomized trial ', ' Devices ', ' Smoking ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Decision Making ', ' Physical activity ', ' psychosocial ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Belief ', ' Ohio ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' programs ', ' Research ', ' Physicians ', ' Walking ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Monitor ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Training Programs ', ' skills ', ' Cognitive ', ' statistics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Control Groups ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' improved ', ' Problem Solving ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Procedures ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Symptoms ', ' Address ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Time ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Site ', ' Health ', ' Age ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' novel ', ' Work ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' coping ', ' Patients ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Universities ', ' Testing ', ' base ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' American ', ' Morbidity -

"Feasibility of Telehealth CBT for Social Anxiety Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social anxiety disorder (SAD), a psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent and intense fear of one or more social situations that are avoided or endured with marked distress, is the third most common psychiatric disorder and can lead to substantial interference and suffering. Research on interventions for SAD has demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Despite the substantial empirical support of CBT for SAD, lack of access to the best psychosocial treatments represents a significant public health problem. In particular, access to appropriate, empirically supported care in rural areas is often limited due to a number of barriers, including shortage of health-care specialists in rural areas and distance from services. One approach to overcoming such barriers is to utilize new technologies that may help increase access to care. Telehealth-delivered psychotherapy may be particularly useful in addressing this problem. A growing body of evidence has documented the utility of telehealth-delivered medical health-care, particularly telepsychiatry. Social anxiety disorder is an ideal disorder to test the feasibility of such a treatment modality, given the interpersonal focus of the disorder and that efficacious treatments have been identified. Therefore, the proposed study will examine the efficacy and acceptability of CBT for social anxiety disorder delivered via a telehealth format. Participants will undergo a comprehensive diagnostic interview and baseline assessment. Participants with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder will be randomly assigned to either receive telehealth-delivered CBT (TH) or a waitlist (WL) control group. Following treatment, participants will complete a posttreatment assessment and diagnostic interview. If treatment can be successfully delivered in a telehealth format for individuals with SAD, then the same format should be efficacious for the other anxiety disorders, for which highly effective exposure-based treatments are also available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Telehealth-delivered psychotherapy may be particularly useful to address disparities in access to care, a significant public health problem, by increasing the availability of treatment. If treatment can be successfully delivered in a telehealth format for individuals with SAD, this will help establish the feasibility of utilizing telehealth technology to deliver evidence-based mental health services and, thus, increasing access to care. Establishing the feasibility of telehealth-delivered treatment with SAD would also suggest that the same format should be similarly efficacious for other anxiety disorders, given the similarities of exposure-based treatments.             Project Narrative  Telehealth-delivered psychotherapy may be particularly useful to address disparities in access to care, a  significant public health problem, by increasing the availability of treatment.

"Symptoms and Self Management in Low Income African Americans with Advanced Cancer This purpose of the study is to explore the symptom experience and symptom self- management practices of low-income African American adults with Stage IV cancer. The specific aims are to: 1) explore the symptom experience of low-income African American patients with advanced cancer and 2) explore the symptom self-management experience of low- income African American patients with advanced cancer. A qualitative descriptive approach will be used to describe the symptom experiences as described by patients including a description of their symptoms, strategies used to manage symptoms and any facilitators and barriers to their management of cancer-related symptoms. Approximately 15 men and 15 women will be enrolled in in-depth interviews to discuss symptom experience and symptom self-management strategies. Understanding and correcting disparities has become a priority for many leading research organizations such as the National Cancer Institute, the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities, the National Institute of Nursing Research, the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine, Healthy People 2010 of Health and Human Services, and the American Cancer Society. The significance of this study addresses the initiatives of many of these organizations. Specifically the focus of this application addresses two of the four areas of research interest of the NINR Strategic Plan (2006-2010), improving quality of life and eliminating health disparities, and has implications for a third area, end-of-life. Project Narrative  Relevance: The experience of low income African Americans with cancer needs to be described to begin to further understand and eliminate disparities in cancer care in the United States. The gap in the literature in symptom management is worrisome at a time when more African Americans are being diagnosed with advanced cancer and patients are being asked to manage symptoms at home with limited resources. The information gained from this study will provide the groundwork for a larger research program to develop and test culturally appropriate interventions to improve symptom self-management strategies and outcomes in this disadvantaged group.",Symptoms and Self Management in Low Income African Americans with Advanced Cancer,8073589,F31NR011383,"['Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' symptom management ', ' cancer type ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Survival Rate ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Hospitals ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Self Management ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Persons ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Interview ', ' Economics ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Caring ', ' Individual ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health ', ' disability ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' United States ', ' Reporting ', ' Woman ', ' experience ', ' Population ', ' Area ', ' Participant ', ' Patients ', ' Testing ', ' programs ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' interest ', ' Patient Isolation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Affect ', ' Collection ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Clinic ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Physicians ', ' Severities ', ' improved ', ' Symptoms ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Services ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Learning ', ' Time ', ' Staging ', ' Literature ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Research ', ' Work ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' cancer care ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Medication Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Social isolation ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' cancer statistics ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2011,22662,0.12307591735594359
"Palliative Care Symptom Management in Rural Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Palliative care aims to provide relief of pain and other patient symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, and depression, in order to improve quality of life. Patients in isolated rural settings often lack easy access to palliative care and other specialist services. Yet rural residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to be older; be in poorer overall health; suffer from more chronic or serious illnesses and disabilities; be uninsured or underinsured; and live in poverty. Telehealth is an emerging method of health care delivery that has been found useful and effective in many clinical settings and specialties. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and increase access to specialist care in rural settings. We propose a cluster randomized clinical trial design to test the effects of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care symptom-management program for 288 cancer patients and 96 providers in rural health care settings. The proposed program will provide services to both patients and providers: Patients will conduct self-assessments and report pain and other symptoms via telehealth. Health care providers will receive telehealth-delivered case consultations that will include case management, evidence-based practice resources, and peer support. Providers and their patients will be randomly assigned to intervention groups, which receive the telehealth- enhanced palliative care symptom-management intervention, or to control groups. Our primary aim is to compare patient self-reports of symptoms and quality of life in the intervention and control groups over 2 months. Aim 2 is to examine, in the intervention and control groups over 2 months, providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding symptoms and perceived competence in treating symptoms. Aim 3 is to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. We will use mixed effects models with patients nested within providers to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes. Findings from this study will be instrumental in advancing telehealth and improving symptom management and palliative care among underserved rural populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rural patients face many health disparities, including challenges in obtaining palliative care for relief of pain and other distressing symptoms.

"First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cannabis use in adolescence and young adulthood is very common in the United States. Accumulating evidence suggests that, unlike other illicit drugs, cannabis used in adolescence may be a causal risk factor for schizophrenia, and cannabis use affects the symptoms, course, and outcomes of the illness. The proposed research seeks to clarify the impact of cannabis use on the age at onset of prodromal symptoms (e.g., decline in functioning, difficulties concentrating, irritability, and sleep disturbances that precede psychosis), the age at onset of psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucinations and delusions), and the nature of negative, cognitive, neurological, and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The study also will determine whether or not a previously characterized gene-environment interaction} involving the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and pre-onset cannabis use} influences onset ages and symptomatology. The study involves hospitalized patients with a first episode of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, most of whom are African American. This population is of particular relevance given well-recognized ongoing healthcare disparities across ethnic groups, under-representation of African Americans in clinical research, underuse of mental health services by African Americans, and very high rates of cannabis use in this population. The specific aims of the research are: (1) to clarify the effects of cannabis use on disease onset by studying (a) age at onset of prodromal symptoms and (b) age at onset of psychotic symptoms in first-episode patients who used cannabis in the years prior to onset as well as those who did not; (2) to study the impact of cannabis use on disease phenomenology (i.e., symptoms, cognitive deficits, neurological signs) by comparing the clinical characteristics of first-episode patients who used cannabis prior to hospitalization with those who did not; and (3) to elucidate the impact of a specific gene-environment interaction on disease onset and disease phenomenology by investigating the effects of the COMT Val158Met functional polymorphism genotype, cannabis use, and their interaction on onset ages and symptom profiles of first-episode patients. The research will be conducted using extensive cross-sectional assessments of hospitalized first-episode patients whose data will be supplemented by information from family members/informants. Thorough and psychometrically sound instruments will be used to retrospectively assess past substance use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because schizophrenia can be such a devastating illness, efforts to better understand modifiable determinants of course and outcomes are crucial. Innovative aspects of this research that make it especially relevant and innovative include: (1) testing of focused hypotheses will be tested related to a specific recently discovered gene-environment interaction, (2) reliance on a predominantly African American sample, a group that is under- represented in psychiatric research despite a high prevalence of key risk factors, (3) the preventive implications related to future potential enhancements of outcomes by reducing cannabis use among adolescents who are at especially high risk, (4) measurement of all past use of all substances thoroughly and carefully, allowing for examination of potential interactions among the key variables being studied, and (5) the use of Ancestry-Informative Markers in the genetic analysis to control for potential effects of admixture and population stratification.          ",First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use,8080183,R01MH081011,"['12 year old ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' Cannabis ', ' Hemp Plant ', ' Stratification ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Auditory ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' instrument ', ' 14 year old ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Population ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' sound ', ' Pattern ', ' Health ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Sampling ', ' Preventive ', ' Delusions ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' Data ', ' Knowledge ', ' Memory ', ' Family ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Affect ', ' Address ', ' Clinical ', ' Characteristics ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Environment ', ' United States ', ' Syndrome ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Attention ', ' Nature ', ' Age ', ' Measurement ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Genotype ', ' Outcome ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Future ', ' Mediating ', ' Recommendation ', ' high risk ', ' Risk ', ' Genes ', ' Family member ', ' Research ', ' Genetic ', ' Testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' sex ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' valylvaline ', ' Val-Val ', ' L-valyl-L-valine ', ' informant ', ' Schizophreniform Disorder ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Methyltransferase Gene ', ' Catechol O-Methyltransferase ', ' EC 2.1.1.6 ', ' Catechol Methyltransferase ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Admixture ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Hallucinations ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' Reliance ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,317158,0.06097426936024205
"Psychotic disorders in an African setting: Incidence, early course, and treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic disorders in an African setting: Incidence, early course, and treatment pathways. We propose to pilot and build capacity for a study that will investigate the incidence rate, early course, and treatment pathways (INCET) of first episode psychotic disorders (FEP) in Vulindlela, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa: henceforth referred to as the FEP-INCET study. Whereas most previous studies in Africa have relied upon hospital admissions, the FEP-INCET will encompass those who seek help from informal and formal community practitioners. It will be the first study in an African setting to derive incidence rates for FEP; prospectively investigate the range of early manifestations and early course of FEP; trace the pathways into and out of informal as well as formal health care; and identify factors that influence help-seeking at each point in the pathway. It will establish a platform for future studies, including early intervention studies, biological studies, and genetic studies. We believe that it will be transformative for global mental health, by bringing Africa squarely into the purview of investigators who focus on psychotic disorders. The Principal Investigators are Ezra Susser at Columbia University and Jonathan Burns at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Vulindlela is a poor rural community of population 450,000, mainly Zulu. It is one of the few sites in Africa where such a study is feasible. One reason is that our colleagues in HIV research have studied the population demography, the sociocultural environment, and the health care resources of Vulindlela. The community has a strong traditional council with five traditional wards, each headed by a tribal chief. The tribal chiefs play a key role in community life in parallel with formal government authorities. The unemployment rate is about 45%. More than one third of the population age 15-34 years is HIV positive. Traditional healers predominate in health care, and are usually the first (and often the only) port of call for patients with FEP. A challenging- and novel- feature of FEP-INCET will be the identification of patients at the traditional healer practices. This preparatory study for FEP-INCET will be done in one of the five wards of Vulindlela. In this ward there are 5 traditional healers, two health clinics, no general practitioners, and no hospitals. We will pilot screening for FEP at the five traditional healer and two clinic practices; translate and adapt assessments for use in the isiZulu language and the local culture; and build the capacity at the University of KwaZulu-Natal needed to implement the study. After completing this work, we will prepare an R01 application for the FEP-INCET study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will do the preparatory work required to launch the first ever study of the incidence, course and treatment of first-episode psychoses in an African setting. Whereas most previous studies in Africa have relied upon hospital admissions, this study will include those who seek help from informal and formal community practitioners. We believe that it will be transformative for global mental health, by opening pathways to research and treatment in Africa, and broadening our understanding of the range and frequency of psychotic disorders across the globe.           This study will do the preparatory work required to launch the first ever study of the incidence, course and treatment of first-episode psychoses in an African setting.

"Appraisal and Diagnostic Delay in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality have been well-documented for racial/ethnic minorities. These disparities persist despite widespread and targeted cancer education, screening campaigns, and advancements in cancer therapy. Diagnostic delay is significantly and negatively associated with cancer patient outcomes. Substantial barriers to early detection and diagnosis include lower rates of screening by minorities and access issues due to lack of health insurance. Later detection of cancer, however, is not solely explained by structural barriers to obtaining health care. Evidence has accumulated that cultural and communication factors may play a role in outcome disparities caused by late detection. We propose to examine two important factors that are likely to contribute to a delay in the diagnosis of cancer. First, `appraisal delay', defined as patients' inability to identify, interpret, and bring symptoms to the attention of their physicians. Second, 'diagnostic delay', defined as physicians' inaction or incorrect actions to make a diagnosis. We will examine how diagnostic delay may be associated with an inability to understand, interpret, and communicate effectively with patients. The overall goal of this study is to understand how these factors contribute to delay in detecting cancers in African-Americans, using colon cancer as a paradigm for this phenomenon. The study's specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Identify and examine the factors that influence appraisal delay, e.g., patients' recognition, perception, and response to pre-diagnosis cancer symptoms. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 144 recently diagnosed colon cancer patients to identify their interpretations of the symptoms that eventually result in a diagnosis of cancer. African-American and white cancer patients will be compared. Aim 2. Test whether or not primary care physicians (PCPs) communicate with patients who present pre-diagnosis symptoms of cancer to PCPs differently depending on patient race and gender. To accomplish this, we will use an experimental design to compare the communication patterns and subsequent patient management decisions of a sample of 110 PCPs who will each meet with four unannounced trained patient simulators representing 4 gender-race combinations.This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians. The study's main goal is to improve understanding of the barriers to early diagnosis of cancer, lead to interventions that can help doctors and patients communicate more effectively, and ultimately lead to earlier cancer diagnoses.      Public Health Relevance: This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians.

"Hormones & Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist- clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child- bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute, Each of four Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women or the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education and development of junior investigators who would commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-specific treatment approaches and public awareness as to the importance of these sex-specific health issues for families and society.           ",Hormones & Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside,8145294,K12HD051959,"['General Hospitals ', ' Israel ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Hospitals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Endocrine ', ' Societies ', ' Gender ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Faculty ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Institution ', ' next generation ', ' Awareness ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' sex ', ' Institutes ', ' Mission ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Reading ', ' reproductive ', ' career ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Puberty ', ' human puberty ', ' translational approach ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Ovarian ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' treatment response ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' Breast ', ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Sexual Development ', ' sex development ', ' Research ', ' Family ', ' Communities ', ' Commit ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Health ', ' base ', ' Female ', ' Clinical ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' interest ', ' Work ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' public health relevance ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Woman ', ' Mentors ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Medical center ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Structure ', ' Scientist ', ' Medical ', ' Aging ', ' Data ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Biology ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' programs ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Training Programs ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Staging ', ' Site ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Incidence ', ' Genes ', ' Training ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2011,674104,0.07556006098048261
"Tools to Optimize Patient Presentation Speed after Onset of Exudative Macular Deg    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific Aims: 1 - to refine a novel set of low cost patent pending interactive home AMD education and monitoring tools that combine tests evaluated favorably in Phase I together with additional novel tools currently in prototype. 2 - To clinically evaluate the effectiveness of these tools in reducing the delay between onset of symptoms and presentation, thus potentially minimizing vision loss. Significance: Macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in those over 60. New anti-VEGF treatments introduced in 2005 are effective if given early but patients typically wait for up to 5 months after the onset of symptoms to see a healthcare professional, leading to unnecessary vision loss. This results in incremental costs of care (which most often accrue to Medicare), a higher societal burden and lower patient quality of life. In earlier studies, we have identified critical reasons for patient delay and significant gaps in the current standard of care. Our solutions address the most significant reasons for patient delay in a cost-effective format capable of distribution to millions of patients, that, if successful, will accelerate presentation and minimize vision loss for a significant population of patients. Background: There are almost 10 million people with early AMD in the US, with the number expected to rise to 17.8 million by 2050. 2,3 of this population, 10 to 15% of dry patients will eventually convert to wet AMD.4 The conversion from dry to wet AMD can occur suddenly and has been historically difficult to recognize and respond to by patients. Delays in presentation of up to 5 months are common.8 In a recent study of patients with newly diagnosed wet AMD, the most common patient-cited reasons for delay were lack of confidence in symptoms, and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the problem. The current gold standard of home monitoring, the Amsler Grid, developed in the 1940's, does not address the top reasons for delay, nor does it address the variety of symptoms that patients experience with advancing disease. New electronic technologies for improving home monitoring AMD have demonstrated sensitivity and specificity, but their cost and learning curve can limit broad-scale distribution. A solution is required that 1) addresses the multiple reasons for delay, 2) is low-cost and amenable to distribution across large populations, 3) includes multiple interactive elements that address patient compliance and individual needs, and 4) fosters appropriate and timely action. Research design and methods: 1) conduct focus group evaluation of current prototype tools. 2) Refine the prototypes based upon patient feedback. 3) Conduct a clinical evaluation of the performance of the novel tools, measuring drop in visual acuity prior to presentation after onset of wet AMD. If successful, tools will enable broad-scale outreach, reduce educational disparities, foster routine eye exams, help accelerate patient presentation, help reduce vision loss, and help lower the socioeconomic burden of AMD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in adults over the age of 60.1 New injectable treatments introduced in 2005 are effective if given early but patients typically wait for up to 5 months after the onset of symptoms to see a healthcare professional, leading to unnecessary vision loss.

"Antipsychotics and Vascular Function in Bipolar Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application requests funding to support the training and research activities for Dr. Jess G. Fiedorowicz. His goal is to develop expertise in human cardiovascular physiology for the assessment of vascular function in patients with bipolar disorder. Vascular function represents an important intermediate phenotype in the development of atherosclerosis and has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Bipolar disorders are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The first-line, second- generation antipsychotics associated with weight gain (SGAWGs: risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) have been associated with significant metabolic complications, which may increase risk for vascular disease. Assessment of vascular function may allow identification of clinically relevant mechanisms for the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with bipolar disorder. This research and training plan strongly emphasizes interdisciplinary and translational research as outlined by the NIH Roadmap.  As a psychiatrist, Dr. Fiedorowicz seeks additional training in translational research applications in human vascular physiology and pharmacology, related statistical methodologies, and the ethical conduct and design of research. The research plan proposes a 26-week, prospective, naturalistic cohort study to examine the relationship of SGAWG use and vascular function in bipolar disorders by studying incident users of SGAWGs and non-users of antipsychotics with bipolar disorders. The primary aim of this study is to determine the magnitude and timeline of antipsychotic-induced changes in vascular function in incident users of SGAWGs. The methodology employed will allow for mechanistic investigation with particular focus on insulin resistance and visceral obesity.

"Integrated Online Assessment and Intervention Targeting Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Socioeconomic and other factors such as race, ethnicity, income, education, and place of residence are associated with reduced access to and poorer quality healthcare. Clinicians serving disadvantaged populations are often overloaded, and have little chance to gather a comprehensive biomedical and psychosocial (biopsychosocial, BPS) evaluation of patients. This situation is unfortunate because many physical symptoms are medically unexplained, reflecting a pattern of high symptom reporting or underlying psychosocial issues, such as depression, trauma, or poorly-tolerated stress. These BPS factors are particularly problematic for patients from disadvantaged populations. Lastly, severe, medically unexplained symptoms, psychosocial issues, and poor quality of life (QOL) occur together in a subset of at-risk individuals (ARI), which comprises about 20% of typical clinic populations. ARI are at risk for poor outcomes and high costs from inappropriate care, a problem that is compounded in disadvantaged and minority populations where access to primary care is limited and urgent care is more prevalent than preventive care. SOLUTION: Our objective is to deploy a clinical methodology and infrastructure to ensure delivery of patient-centered care to minority and disadvantaged patients. Our work builds on an online, patient self-assessment system called CarePrep, now operational in clinic. CarePrep allows patients to easily enter and track BPS and QOL data over the Internet from home or clinic. However, just handing a diagnosis of depression, for example, to a clinician does not change outcomes. Therefore, we will also deploy an integrated intervention to support BPS care. APPROACH: 1) We will adapt, enhance cultural sensitivity, deploy, refine, and initially validate CarePrep in a primary care setting. Our goals are to meet the needs of patients and clinicians for enhancing communication and patient- centered care, ensuring that BPS issues are uncovered. Patients will be asked to do CarePrep before clinic. We will assess validity, feasibility, and CarePrep's ability to accurately identify patients who warrant extra attention (ARI) by findings such as severe symptoms, psychosocial issues, impaired QOL, or substance abuse. 2) We will analyze and develop a plan for supporting culturally competent, BPS care using some combination of automated CarePrep functionality, training and supporting care managers or existing clinic staff in delivering simple, brief BPS interventions, and telehealth support. IMPACT stems from 1) creating a system that generates sufficient value to patients, clinicians, and administrators to warrant routine use; 2) creating a streamlined, branching assessment that minimizes redundancy and maximizes relevance, thereby supporting collection of the full spectrum of relevant data and delivery of context-relevant education and guidance; 3) using this technology and clinical methodology to transcend barriers to care for minorities and disadvantaged populations, and 4) identifying, characterizing, and targeting care to the patients with the greatest need and highest utilization within such populations, thereby facilitating cost-effective use of limited healthcare dollars.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work adapts an online, patient self-assessment system now in operation in clinic to support delivery of patient-centered care for minority and disadvantaged patients. We focus on helping clinicians care for patients with multiple, severe physical symptoms, psychosocial, and health behavioral issues that interfere with their quality of life and ability to function, because these patients now have the poorest outcomes and consume a disproportionate share of resources. These outcomes are likely to be worse in disadvantaged and minority populations where access to primary care is limited and urgent care more prevalent than preventive care. Our online system gathers a comprehensive assessment and presents the data so that clinicians can rapidly identify the most important issues. However, simply delivering this information is not enough; we also propose to support care by a combination of the online system offloading clinician tasks, training and supporting care managers or clinicians to help in assessment and treatment, and delivering telehealth support where needed.           This work adapts an online, patient self-assessment system now in operation in clinic to support delivery of patient-centered care for minority and disadvantaged patients.

"Telephone-based coping skills training for COPD This revised competing renewal application seeks to extend our previous work among patients with end stage lung disease to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, enhanced coping skills training (CST) protocol for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is an obstructive airway disease marked by symptoms of dyspnea, paroxysmal coughing, pain, fatigue, and insomnia. Approximately 12.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD and 70% of these cases represent individuals under the age of 65. COPD patients who are at an early stage of their disease often experience a progressive worsening of symptoms, while the advanced stages of the disease may be marked by frequent visits to the emergency department or inpatient hospitalizations for acute COPD exacerbations. Importantly, COPD also is a fatal condition for many patients, and is the fourth leading cause of preventable death for both men and women in the United States, with over 120,000 deaths reported in 2002. Although COPD is preventable (i.e., by not smoking), there is no cure for the disease and therefore the symptoms must be managed effectively. It has been well-established that brief, focused cognitive-behavioral therapy can significantly improve psychological function in medically ill persons, the wide geographic distribution of patients with COPD, along with their chronic exacerbations of illness, make face-to-face delivery of such therapy extremely difficult. Our previous work demonstrated that a telephone-based coping skills intervention (CST) with patients awaiting lung transplantation was effective in improving quality of life but did not improve physical functioning or survival. In that study, patients with COPD at an earlier stage of their disease process appeared to benefit most from CST. Thus, the present application proposes a larger, dual-site (Duke and Ohio State University), randomized trial among patients with COPD, using a comprehensive set of outcome measures over an extended follow-up period. Six hundred COPD patients will be randomly assigned to either a telephone-based enhanced, caregiver-assisted CST intervention or to a Usual care plus education and symptom monitoring Control group. Patients and their self-identified caregivers will undergo comprehensive assessments of physical and psychosocial functioning before and after a 16-week intervention. The study will examine the short- and longer- term impact of CST on psychological distress and quality of life as well as the effects of the intervention on morbidity, mortality, and medical costs over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop more effective ways to help patients with chronic lung disease and their caregivers cope more effectively with problematic symptoms, reduce distress, improve quality of life, enhance physical functioning, and increase survival. Project Narrative Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a significant health problem in the United States and throughout the world, and is considered the fourth leading cause of death in the US. This study will examine the effects of an enhanced coping skills training program for COPD patients and their caregivers, delivered by telephone, on patients' psychosocial and physical functioning and long-term survival.

"Antipsychotics and Vascular Function in Bipolar Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application requests funding to support the training and research activities for Dr. Jess G. Fiedorowicz. His goal is to develop expertise in human cardiovascular physiology for the assessment of vascular function in patients with bipolar disorder. Vascular function represents an important intermediate phenotype in the development of atherosclerosis and has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Bipolar disorders are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The first-line, second- generation antipsychotics associated with weight gain (SGAWGs: risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) have been associated with significant metabolic complications, which may increase risk for vascular disease. Assessment of vascular function may allow identification of clinically relevant mechanisms for the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with bipolar disorder. This research and training plan strongly emphasizes interdisciplinary and translational research as outlined by the NIH Roadmap.  As a psychiatrist, Dr. Fiedorowicz seeks additional training in translational research applications in human vascular physiology and pharmacology, related statistical methodologies, and the ethical conduct and design of research. The research plan proposes a 26-week, prospective, naturalistic cohort study to examine the relationship of SGAWG use and vascular function in bipolar disorders by studying incident users of SGAWGs and non-users of antipsychotics with bipolar disorders. The primary aim of this study is to determine the magnitude and timeline of antipsychotic-induced changes in vascular function in incident users of SGAWGs. The methodology employed will allow for mechanistic investigation with particular focus on insulin resistance and visceral obesity. This application will provide a foundation for Dr. Fiedorowicz' long-term scientific goal of creating an independent program of interdisciplinary research addressing cardiovascular disease in bipolar disorders and the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychotropic medications.       PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with bipolar disorder bear an excess risk of death from cardiovascular disease.

"Center for Adaptive Leadership in Symptom Science     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Center of Excellence (P30) will promote biobehavioral research to extend symptom science using the Adaptive Leadership (AL) framework to conceptualize and study cognitive/affective symptoms in chronic illness. The overall Center aims are to:    (1) Enhance and sustain the productivity of new nursing scientists engaged in interdisciplinary  biobehavioral research to understand and ameliorate symptoms, symptom distress, and symptom  sequelae using adaptive approaches for people with cognitive/affective changes in chronic illness;  (2) Assist investigators to tailor research approaches and interventions to optimize research  participation by people with cognitive/affective changes by addressing minority health issues and  refining existing, or creating new intervention protocols and self-report measures (i.e.,  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS].  (3) Increase investigator competence in using longitudinal quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches to examine the trajectories of symptoms, symptom sequelae and patient adaptation associated with cognitive/affective changes.    The work of the Center will be carried by in three Cores, the Administrative Core, the Mentoring and Scholarship Core, and the Design and Methods Core. Expected outcomes of the center include  studies of trajectories of cognitive/affective symptoms and symptom sequelae to describe patterns,  variability, and change over time to gain knowledge needed about critical periods or transition points  for timing of interventions, identify differences within subpopulatios such as those with varying levels  of cognitive ability or minority health needs, and generate knowledge for developing/testing  interventions to enhance patients' adaptive capabilities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Barriers to care arise for people with cognitive/affective changes because they may not clearly convey concerns or communicate easily.

"Harvard/Brown Anxiety Program (HARP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental health conditions in the United States. Substantial gaps exist in the literature with respect to the clinical course of anxiety disorders in particular groups of individuals who are continually increasing in prevalence in the U.S. population, particularly African American and Hispanic individuals, and individuals entering older age. Specifically, despite the increasing and substantial number of African American, Hispanic, and older adults in the population, there are no published data on the clinical course of anxiety disorders in these groups of individuals that have been collected using a prospective, short-interval interview, longitudinal, naturalistic design. In this application we propose two timely and needed studies within the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Program (HARP) to address these fundamental gaps in our understanding of the course of anxiety disorders in these understudied populations. First, we propose to expand our newly recruited and prospectively studied sample of African Americans and Hispanics with anxiety disorders to a total of 175 African Americans and 175 Hispanics, and to recruit a contemporaneous sample of 175 non-Hispanic Caucasians, comparable on socioeconomic indicators to the African American and Hispanic samples. The recruitment and prospective, short-interval follow-up of these individuals over the next 5 years will provide the first comprehensive description of the prospective naturalistic course of psychopathology and psychosocial outcomes associated with DSM-IV anxiety disorders and related culture-bound syndromes and symptoms in African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects that are comparable on socioeconomic indicators (AIM 1), as well as examination of predictors of course within each of these three ethnic groups (AIM 2). We will then conduct the first prospective longitudinal test of potential ethnic minority disparities in the course of anxiety disorders (AIM 3) along with the first examination of potential demographic, clinical, environmental stressor, and socio-cultural predictors of ethnic minority disparities in course (AIM 4). Second, we propose to continue observation of members of the original HARP cohort who have been studied for 15 years as they enter older adulthood (all 247 subjects who will reach or exceed the age of 61 during the proposed grant period) to provide new knowledge about the developmental changes that take place in the clinical course of anxiety disorders during the transition to older adulthood (AIMS 5 and 6). We will test the suggestion in the literature, based on epidemiological data, that the course of anxiety disorders improves during the transition to older adulthood; explore the extent to which indicators of declining physical and social wellness may be predictive of worsening course of anxiety disorders as subjects make the transition to older adulthood; and test the hypothesis that those individuals who have had an especially pernicious course of anxiety are at increased risk for age-related cognitive impairment. Taken together, this proposal will provide substantial new clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in understudied individuals in the population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the increasing numbers of both ethnic minorities and individuals entering older age in the United States, there is a dearth of substantial clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, including factors which place them at substantial risk for deleterious health consequences. This project will provide necessary in-depth prospective longitudinal study of the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, and holds promise for providing insight into the factors associated with the medical, psychological, and economic consequences of anxiety disorders in ethnic minorities and aging populations.

"Binge Eating Disorder in an Ethnically Diverse Treatment-Seeking Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Binge eating disorder (BED) is a clinically impairing condition characterized by recurrent out-of-control eating episodes and painful cognitive concerns regarding body shape and weight. BED appears to be equally prevalent across racial/ethnic groups including African Americans, Latinos, and Caucasians, and shows associations with obesity in all racial/ethnic groups. Ethnic minorities with BED are less likely t receive treatment, and most commonly seek treatment for weight management as opposed to mental health issues. Minimal data are available concerning treatment-seeking ethnic minorities with BED. This study aims to describe and compare the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of African American, Latino, and Caucasian patients with BED presenting for treatment at an urban, ethnically-diverse, community-hospital center for nutrition and weight management. The study will use self-report questionnaire methods, and all new intakes will be recruited for participation. Data concerning body mass index (BMI), treatment retention and response after six months will be collected from participants' hospital charts. Data will be collected from N=750 consecutive, consenting presenting for weight management. Prevalence estimates and hospital intake data suggest n=260 of the new intakes will receive a diagnosis of BED, including n=110 African American participants, n=90 Caucasian participants, and n=60 Latino/Hispanic participants. The first aim is to compare racial/ethnic groups regarding demographic variables, BMI, symptoms of binge eating, cognitive symptoms of BED, associated psychiatric issues, self-stigma, level of stress, and reasons for seeking treatment. The second aim is to examine the relative influence of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, readiness for treatment, self-stigma, and stress on treatment retention and response. The third aim is to examine the generalizability of data from treatment efficacy trials by comparing data from this study to the data included in an aggregated database from twelve randomized, controlled trials of psychosocial treatments for BED created with NIMH funding in a study conducted at Boston University and available to the PI. [To further contextualize the data, participants in this study will be compared to individuals with BED included in a publically accessible epidemiological database.] The results from this study will address a severe lack of information regarding treatment-seeking ethnic minorities with BED at the most common point of entry to relevant health services for this population. Data concerning the symptoms, treatment retention and motivation in minority groups are crucial to informing successful provision of health services and addressing related health disparities. This fellowship will also support an underrepresented minority in a research field-psychopathology and treatment of eating disorders-that has few racial/ethnic minorities among its academic researchers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is a clinically impairing condition that appears to be prevalent across all ethnic groups; however, there are very little data on the topic of BED among treatment-seeking ethnic minorities. The current study aims to identify the clinical epidemiology of BED in an under-researched health services delivery setting (i.e., an urban community hospital weigh management program), where ethnic minorities with BED are most likely to seek treatment. These data concerning symptoms, motivation for treatment, mutable predictors of treatment retention and response in minority groups are crucial to informing successful provision of health services.                  Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is a clinically impairing condition that appears to be prevalent across all ethnic groups; however, there are very little data on the topic of BED among treatment-seeking ethnic minorities.

"Effects of Social Context, Culture and Minority Status on Depression and Anxiety     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project investigates the social mechanisms behind ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence of major depression disorder (MDD) and depressive and anxiety symptoms (DAS) in Latino young adults (ages 17-25). We propose to extend the path-breaking Boricua study to examine if experiences of minority status and acculturation are causally linked to differences in prevalence of MDD/DAS across Island versus mainland Puerto Ricans. Since Puerto Ricans are a minority in the South Bronx in NY but a majority on the Island of Puerto Rico, this migrant study design enables us to use variation across sites as a way to examine the causal mechanism of minority status and acculturation on mental health outcomes. Our planned study also includes a wide range of environmental, social, family, and individual level measures associated with MDD and DAS, and uses advanced statistical techniques to identify the risks and protective factors for these negative outcomes. We propose to conduct follow-up interviews with parents and with young adults now ages 17-25 who participated in the Boricua study. Using these data, we will conduct quantitative analysis to: 1) determine the causal impact of minority status as contrasted to majority status, 2) identify the mechanisms behind the effect of minority status on subsequent MDD and DAS, and 3) test conditions that moderate the causal link between minority status and environmental and social context. We will supplement the quantitative analysis with in- depth qualitative interviews and ethnographic neighborhood observation to deepen our understanding of the quantitative findings and identify minority status experiences and acculturation stresses potentially related to changes in MDD and DAS, as well as functional impairment. At the close of our study we intend to create a public-use database of the four waves of Boricua study. This would be the first longitudinal study to assess the causal effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young adult mental illness. Our ultimate goal is to generate information to reduce mental illness in minority communities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed longitudinal project is the first to investigate the long-term effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young-adult mental illness.

"Palliative Care Symptom Management in Rural Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Palliative care aims to provide relief of pain and other patient symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, and depression, in order to improve quality of life. Patients in isolated rural settings often lack easy access to palliative care and other specialist services. Yet rural residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to be older; be in poorer overall health; suffer from more chronic or serious illnesses and disabilities; be uninsured or underinsured; and live in poverty. Telehealth is an emerging method of health care delivery that has been found useful and effective in many clinical settings and specialties. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and increase access to specialist care in rural settings. We propose a cluster randomized clinical trial design to test the effects of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care symptom-management program for 288 cancer patients and 96 providers in rural health care settings. The proposed program will provide services to both patients and providers: Patients will conduct self-assessments and report pain and other symptoms via telehealth. Health care providers will receive telehealth-delivered case consultations that will include case management, evidence-based practice resources, and peer support. Providers and their patients will be randomly assigned to intervention groups, which receive the telehealth- enhanced palliative care symptom-management intervention, or to control groups. Our primary aim is to compare patient self-reports of symptoms and quality of life in the intervention and control groups over 2 months. Aim 2 is to examine, in the intervention and control groups over 2 months, providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding symptoms and perceived competence in treating symptoms. Aim 3 is to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. We will use mixed effects models with patients nested within providers to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes. Findings from this study will be instrumental in advancing telehealth and improving symptom management and palliative care among underserved rural populations.        Rural patients face many health disparities, including challenges in obtaining palliative care for relief of pain and other distressing symptoms. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care symptom-management intervention for rural cancer patients and their health care providers. The findings of this study will be instrumental in enhancing symptom management and palliative care, which will have applicability to delivery of other specialist care among underserved rural populations.

"Conduct Disorder & Depression in Girls:  Precursors, Development and Comorbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive interventions depend in large part on the availability of reliable and specific information about the development of psychopathology. Three of the priority areas for clinical research identified in the 2007/2008 NIMH Strategic Plan are the 1) prediction of individuals at risk for developing disease; 2) personalization of knowledge about individual biological, environmental and social factors to better personalize interventions; and 3) participation of the diversity of people and settings in clinical research The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), a large-scale (n=2,451), longitudinal study of a representative, urban sample of African American and European American girls, is uniquely poised to illuminate each of these topic areas as they pertain to Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): two disorders that generate the greatest amount of morbidity among adolescent females and contribute the largest portion to the global burden of disease among women (Murray & Lopez. 1997). In particular, the PGS aims to predict female CD and MDD by building developmental models of risk and protection from the early identification of individual vulnerabilities that serve as childhood precursors to disorders, and the contexts in which such vulnerabilities are more likely to lead to disorder, by operationalizing sub-syndromal phenotypes of disorders, and by examining developmental changes in the pattern of comorbid conditions. Prediction will be based on multiple annual assessments of this racially and economically diverse sample with high rates of participant retention (average of 94 percent over 7 waves). Thus far, we have generated data on the onset, stability and developmental course of DSM-IV symptoms for CD and MDD and a broad range of other disorders. We also have assessed potential moderating and mediating factors on the development of symptomatology in girls. We are seeking funds to continue this prospective study through adolescence with five annual assessments of the girls and their mothers and fathers. The girls will be aged 13-16 in wave 1, and aged 17-20 years in wave 5. The planned assessments, when linked to the developmental data already collected during childhood, will elucidate precursors to CD and MDD in adolescence, their sub-syndromal phenotypes, common patterns of comorbidity, and risk, promotive and protective factors associated with transitions from precursor, to sub-syndrome, to disorder, and to comorbid disorders. The study is relevant for understanding ethnic disparities in the manifestation of CD and MDD and can serve as a building block for personalized, preventive and remedial treatments to be developed for specific subgroups of girls at risk of CD, MDD, their co-occurrence, and comorbidity with other disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will provide information on specific emotional and behavioral problems assessed in young girls that are markers for later serious problems in adolescence and young adulthood. The study also examines family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors that increase or reduce these risks. The diversity of the participants in this community sample (e.g. equal numbers of African American and European American girls, broad range of income levels) will allow information to be gathered about early and ongoing risks and problems that are more important for different subgroups, which can serve as building blocks for screening devices and the prevention of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems.

"Characterization of the PAD Symptom Experience    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic occlusive disease affecting more than 8 million Americans, a number expected to rise sharply due to an aging population. PAD causes insufficient blood flow to the legs, which leads to debilitating, activity-induced, ischemic pain (i.e. claudication). Although health care providers consider claudication the hallmark symptom of PAD, it is reported by less than 29% of PAD patients. When individuals report symptoms inconsistent with ""classic claudication,"" provider suspicion of disease presence is not triggered; therefore patients do not receive the necessary diagnostic testing and subsequent diagnosis. The breadth of PAD symptom experiences based on age and gender is poorly understood, but is a crucial component to providing timely diagnosis and treatment in an attempt to prevent amputation, heart attack, stroke, and death. Consistent with the scientific mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research to expand nursing science by integrating the biological and behavioral sciences, the proposed study utilizes a mixed methods approach to provide an integrated, comprehensive, and biobehavioral understanding of the PAD symptom experience. Subjective data will be obtained through in-depth interviews and symptom reports during treadmill walking. Objective, physiologic data related to ischemic changes in calf skeletal muscle will be obtained during treadmill walking. The objectives of the proposed descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional study are to elicit a comprehensive description of PAD symptoms and related physiologic data, and to determine the degree of correspondence to delineate causative mechanisms underlying symptoms (an NINR area of emphasis). This study will provide a comprehensive and accurate description of the subjective PAD symptom experience and will, for the first time, simultaneously evaluate subjective symptoms and objective physiologic ischemic changes in working skeletal muscles. This study has significant implications for the improvement of PAD assessment and diagnosis to optimize health by broadening currently accepted symptom descriptors, and to reduce health disparities by identifying age and gender differences in PAD symptom experiences. This study is foundational for future research to determine patterns of ischemia, their relationship to symptom report, and potential changes with therapeutic interventions, leading to the long term goal of developing and refining gender and age specific screening tools. The knowledge gained from this study has significant public health implications for the over 8 million undertreated, debilitated, and at-risk Americans that suffer daily from this painful, deadly, and life limiting disease--improving detection, diagnosis, and treatment.        Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 8 million Americans and places individuals at an increased risk for amputation, heart attack, stroke, and death.

"Psychotic disorders in an African setting: Incidence, early course, and treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic disorders in an African setting: Incidence, early course, and treatment pathways. We propose to pilot and build capacity for a study that will investigate the incidence rate, early course, and treatment pathways (INCET) of first episode psychotic disorders (FEP) in Vulindlela, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa: henceforth referred to as the FEP-INCET study. Whereas most previous studies in Africa have relied upon hospital admissions, the FEP-INCET will encompass those who seek help from informal and formal community practitioners. It will be the first study in an African setting to derive incidence rates for FEP; prospectively investigate the range of early manifestations and early course of FEP; trace the pathways into and out of informal as well as formal health care; and identify factors that influence help-seeking at each point in the pathway. It will establish a platform for future studies, including early intervention studies, biological studies, and genetic studies. We believe that it will be transformative for global mental health, by bringing Africa squarely into the purview of investigators who focus on psychotic disorders. The Principal Investigators are Ezra Susser at Columbia University and Jonathan Burns at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Vulindlela is a poor rural community of population 450,000, mainly Zulu. It is one of the few sites in Africa where such a study is feasible. One reason is that our colleagues in HIV research have studied the population demography, the sociocultural environment, and the health care resources of Vulindlela. The community has a strong traditional council with five traditional wards, each headed by a tribal chief. The tribal chiefs play a key role in community life in parallel with formal government authorities. The unemployment rate is about 45%. More than one third of the population age 15-34 years is HIV positive. Traditional healers predominate in health care, and are usually the first (and often the only) port of call for patients with FEP. A challenging- and novel- feature of FEP-INCET will be the identification of patients at the traditional healer practices. This preparatory study for FEP-INCET will be done in one of the five wards of Vulindlela. In this ward there are 5 traditional healers, two health clinics, no general practitioners, and no hospitals. We will pilot screening for FEP at the five traditional healer and two clinic practices; translate and adapt assessments for use in the isiZulu language and the local culture; and build the capacity at the University of KwaZulu-Natal needed to implement the study. After completing this work, we will prepare an R01 application for the FEP-INCET study.        This study will do the preparatory work required to launch the first ever study of the incidence, course and treatment of first-episode psychoses in an African setting. Whereas most previous studies in Africa have relied upon hospital admissions, this study will include those who seek help from informal and formal community practitioners. We believe that it will be transformative for global mental health, by opening pathways to research and treatment in Africa, and broadening our understanding of the range and frequency of psychotic disorders across the globe.

"Hormones & Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist- clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child- bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute, Each of four Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women or the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education and development of junior investigators who would commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-specific treatment approaches and public awareness as to the importance of these sex-specific health issues for families and society.

"Integrated Online Assessment and Intervention Targeting Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Socioeconomic and other factors such as race, ethnicity, income, education, and place of residence are associated with reduced access to and poorer quality healthcare. Clinicians serving disadvantaged populations are often overloaded, and have little chance to gather a comprehensive biomedical and psychosocial (biopsychosocial, BPS) evaluation of patients. This situation is unfortunate because many physical symptoms are medically unexplained, reflecting a pattern of high symptom reporting or underlying psychosocial issues, such as depression, trauma, or poorly-tolerated stress. These BPS factors are particularly problematic for patients from disadvantaged populations. Lastly, severe, medically unexplained symptoms, psychosocial issues, and poor quality of life (QOL) occur together in a subset of at-risk individuals (ARI), which comprises about 20% of typical clinic populations. ARI are at risk for poor outcomes and high costs from inappropriate care, a problem that is compounded in disadvantaged and minority populations where access to primary care is limited and urgent care is more prevalent than preventive care. SOLUTION: Our objective is to deploy a clinical methodology and infrastructure to ensure delivery of patient-centered care to minority and disadvantaged patients. Our work builds on an online, patient self-assessment system called CarePrep, now operational in clinic. CarePrep allows patients to easily enter and track BPS and QOL data over the Internet from home or clinic. However, just handing a diagnosis of depression, for example, to a clinician does not change outcomes. Therefore, we will also deploy an integrated intervention to support BPS care. APPROACH: 1) We will adapt, enhance cultural sensitivity, deploy, refine, and initially validate CarePrep in a primary care setting. Our goals are to meet the needs of patients and clinicians for enhancing communication and patient- centered care, ensuring that BPS issues are uncovered. Patients will be asked to do CarePrep before clinic. We will assess validity, feasibility, and CarePrep's ability to accurately identify patients who warrant extra attention (ARI) by findings such as severe symptoms, psychosocial issues, impaired QOL, or substance abuse. 2) We will analyze and develop a plan for supporting culturally competent, BPS care using some combination of automated CarePrep functionality, training and supporting care managers or existing clinic staff in delivering simple, brief BPS interventions, and telehealth support. IMPACT stems from 1) creating a system that generates sufficient value to patients, clinicians, and administrators to warrant routine use; 2) creating a streamlined, branching assessment that minimizes redundancy and maximizes relevance, thereby supporting collection of the full spectrum of relevant data and delivery of context-relevant education and guidance; 3) using this technology and clinical methodology to transcend barriers to care for minorities and disadvantaged populations, and 4) identifying, characterizing, and targeting care to the patients with the greatest need and highest utilization within such populations, thereby facilitating cost-effective use of limited healthcare dollars.        This work adapts an online, patient self-assessment system now in operation in clinic to support delivery of patient-centered care for minority and disadvantaged patients. We focus on helping clinicians care for patients with multiple, severe physical symptoms, psychosocial, and health behavioral issues that interfere with their quality of life and ability to function, because these patients now have the poorest outcomes and consume a disproportionate share of resources. These outcomes are likely to be worse in disadvantaged and minority populations where access to primary care is limited and urgent care more prevalent than preventive care. Our online system gathers a comprehensive assessment and presents the data so that clinicians can rapidly identify the most important issues. However, simply delivering this information is not enough; we also propose to support care by a combination of the online system offloading clinician tasks, training and supporting care managers or clinicians to help in assessment and treatment, and delivering telehealth support where needed.

"Tech-Based Depression and Anxiety Treatment for Youth in High Risk Environments The PI¿s career goal is to become an independent investigator developing and evaluating novel interventions for underserved, vulnerable youth with anxiety and depressive disorders. This proposal outlines a plan to achieve this goal, through culmination of the training and research plans into an extremely competitive R01 proposal. The training plan takes full advantage of the candidate¿s strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University¿s Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as relations with the broader community of researchers working with youth in high risk social environments. Training will include multidisciplinary mentorship, coursework, conferences, seminars, systematic professional interactions, readings, collaboration with a youth advisory board, and a mentored publication plan. Training goals necessary to the PI¿s career goal involve growth in: 1) intervention development and evaluation; 2) adolescent psychology; 3) cultural issues pertinent to vulnerable youth; and 4) general career development. This plan builds on the PI¿s background in clinical psychology, which has focused on technology- based treatments for depression and anxiety, contextual models of mental health disparities, implications of co- occurring psychiatric disorders on treatment outcomes, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In this K08, the PI will extend her work to include youth, increasing the impact of her research through earlier intervention. The long-term goal of the research is to open a new avenue to culturally competent care by: 1) applying treatment principles efficacious in general populations to unique concerns of underserved youth facing multiple risks to their physical and mental health; 2) developing a mobile treatment that provides real-time, context- specific intervention; and 3) extending population-level care, via Internet and mobile phone technologies, to youth unable to access existing services. To this end, the research plan will: 1) identify context-specific risk factors for anxiety and depressive symptoms in vulnerable youth; 2) identify treatment targets accordingly; and 3) develop an engaging, accessible intervention tailored to vulnerable adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The intervention, delivered via an advanced mobile phone application, the Internet, and brief telephone support, will be grounded in validated CBT techniques and more recent advances in transdiagnostic CBT. Research aims will be achieved via: 1) Study 1, analysis of an existing longitudinal, epidemiological dataset to identify context-specific social stressors that predict increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and cognitive mechanisms by which the social stressors impact anxiety and depression; 2) Study 2, development, usability testing, and a subsequent feasibility trial of a new, transdiagnostic Internet and mobile phone intervention teaching CBT skills to vulnerable adolescents with MDD and GAD, and applying these skills to targets identified from Study 1; and 3) Study 3, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the intervention to an attention control. Studies 2 and 3 will provide preliminary data for an R01 proposing a larger RCT. The proposed research will identity group-specific intervention targets to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in vulnerable youth, through analysis of an existing longitudinal study in a sample of youth in high risk social environments. Findings will be translated to develop and conduct early testing of an intervention designed to decrease symptoms in vulnerable youth with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, using Internet and mobile phone formats that are widely accessible, cost-effective, scalable, private, and familiar to youth.",Tech-Based Depression and Anxiety Treatment for Youth in High Risk

"First-Episode Psychosis and Pre-Onset Cannabis Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cannabis use in adolescence and young adulthood is very common in the United States. Accumulating evidence suggests that, unlike other illicit drugs, cannabis used in adolescence may be a causal risk factor for schizophrenia, and cannabis use affects the symptoms, course, and outcomes of the illness. The proposed research seeks to clarify the impact of cannabis use on the age at onset of prodromal symptoms (e.g., decline in functioning, difficulties concentrating, irritability, and sleep disturbances that precede psychosis), the age at onset of psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucinations and delusions), and the nature of negative, cognitive, neurological, and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The study also will determine whether or not a previously characterized gene-environment interaction} involving the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and pre-onset cannabis use} influences onset ages and symptomatology. The study involves hospitalized patients with a first episode of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, most of whom are African American. This population is of particular relevance given well-recognized ongoing healthcare disparities across ethnic groups, under-representation of African Americans in clinical research, underuse of mental health services by African Americans, and very high rates of cannabis use in this population. The specific aims of the research are: (1) to clarify the effects of cannabis use on disease onset by studying (a) age at onset of prodromal symptoms and (b) age at onset of psychotic symptoms in first-episode patients who used cannabis in the years prior to onset as well as those who did not; (2) to study the impact of cannabis use on disease phenomenology (i.e., symptoms, cognitive deficits, neurological signs) by comparing the clinical characteristics of first-episode patients who used cannabis prior to hospitalization with those who did not; and (3) to elucidate the impact of a specific gene-environment interaction on disease onset and disease phenomenology by investigating the effects of the COMT Val158Met functional polymorphism genotype, cannabis use, and their interaction on onset ages and symptom profiles of first-episode patients. The research will be conducted using extensive cross-sectional assessments of hospitalized first-episode patients whose data will be supplemented by information from family members/informants. Thorough and psychometrically sound instruments will be used to retrospectively assess past substance use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because schizophrenia can be such a devastating illness, efforts to better understand modifiable determinants of course and outcomes are crucial. Innovative aspects of this research that make it especially relevant and innovative include: (1) testing of focused hypotheses will be tested related to a specific recently discovered gene-environment interaction, (2) reliance on a predominantly African American sample, a group that is under- represented in psychiatric research despite a high prevalence of key risk factors, (3) the preventive implications related to future potential enhancements of outcomes by reducing cannabis use among adolescents who are at especially high risk, (4) measurement of all past use of all substances thoroughly and carefully, allowing for examination of potential interactions among the key variables being studied, and (5) the use of Ancestry-Informative Markers in the genetic analysis to control for potential effects of admixture and population stratification.

"Appraisal and Diagnostic Delay in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality have been well-documented for racial/ethnic minorities. These disparities persist despite widespread and targeted cancer education, screening campaigns, and advancements in cancer therapy. Diagnostic delay is significantly and negatively associated with cancer patient outcomes. Substantial barriers to early detection and diagnosis include lower rates of screening by minorities and access issues due to lack of health insurance. Later detection of cancer, however, is not solely explained by structural barriers to obtaining health care. Evidence has accumulated that cultural and communication factors may play a role in outcome disparities caused by late detection. We propose to examine two important factors that are likely to contribute to a delay in the diagnosis of cancer. First, `appraisal delay', defined as patients' inability to identify, interpret, and bring symptoms to the attention of their physicians. Second, 'diagnostic delay', defined as physicians' inaction or incorrect actions to make a diagnosis. We will examine how diagnostic delay may be associated with an inability to understand, interpret, and communicate effectively with patients. The overall goal of this study is to understand how these factors contribute to delay in detecting cancers in African-Americans, using colon cancer as a paradigm for this phenomenon. The study's specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Identify and examine the factors that influence appraisal delay, e.g., patients' recognition, perception, and response to pre-diagnosis cancer symptoms. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 144 recently diagnosed colon cancer patients to identify their interpretations of the symptoms that eventually result in a diagnosis of cancer. African-American and white cancer patients will be compared. Aim 2. Test whether or not primary care physicians (PCPs) communicate with patients who present pre-diagnosis symptoms of cancer to PCPs differently depending on patient race and gender. To accomplish this, we will use an experimental design to compare the communication patterns and subsequent patient management decisions of a sample of 110 PCPs who will each meet with four unannounced trained patient simulators representing 4 gender-race combinations.This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians. The study's main goal is to improve understanding of the barriers to early diagnosis of cancer, lead to interventions that can help doctors and patients communicate more effectively, and ultimately lead to earlier cancer diagnoses.      Public Health Relevance: This project examines how hard it was for people who are eventually diagnosed with colon cancer to recognize and communicate their symptoms to their physicians.

"Palliative Care Symptom Management in Rural Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Palliative care aims to provide relief of pain and other patient symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, and depression, in order to improve quality of life. Patients in isolated rural settings often lack easy access to palliative care and other specialist services. Yet rural residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to be older; be in poorer overall health; suffer from more chronic or serious illnesses and disabilities; be uninsured or underinsured; and live in poverty. Telehealth is an emerging method of health care delivery that has been found useful and effective in many clinical settings and specialties. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and increase access to specialist care in rural settings. We propose a cluster randomized clinical trial design to test the effects of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care symptom-management program for 288 cancer patients and 96 providers in rural health care settings. The proposed program will provide services to both patients and providers: Patients will conduct self-assessments and report pain and other symptoms via telehealth. Health care providers will receive telehealth-delivered case consultations that will include case management, evidence-based practice resources, and peer support. Providers and their patients will be randomly assigned to intervention groups, which receive the telehealth- enhanced palliative care symptom-management intervention, or to control groups. Our primary aim is to compare patient self-reports of symptoms and quality of life in the intervention and control groups over 2 months. Aim 2 is to examine, in the intervention and control groups over 2 months, providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding symptoms and perceived competence in treating symptoms. Aim 3 is to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. We will use mixed effects models with patients nested within providers to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes. Findings from this study will be instrumental in advancing telehealth and improving symptom management and palliative care among underserved rural populations.        Rural patients face many health disparities, including challenges in obtaining palliative care for relief of pain and other distressing symptoms. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care symptom-management intervention for rural cancer patients and their health care providers. The findings of this study will be instrumental in enhancing symptom management and palliative care, which will have applicability to delivery of other specialist care among underserved rural populations.

"Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a uniquely human disorder with specific effects on the uniquely human capacity of language. Indeed, the gross and subtle language abnormalities of schizophrenia can be seen as fundamental illness components, perhaps even as part of a ""biosignature."" Bringing modern linguistics knowledge and tools to this disorder is a promising approach. We have formed a unique, inter-disciplinary collaboration (Dr. Compton, a schizophrenia researcher; Dr. Covington, a computational linguist; Dr. Lunden, a linguist specializing in phonetics; Dr. Cleary, a statistician; and Dr. Blanchard, an expert in measuring negative symptoms) to study some of the most perplexing and disabling facets of schizophrenia, the language/speech abnormalities linked closely to disorganization and negative symptoms. We will analyze speech abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and unaffected controls. Rather than examining a single linguistic parameter, we will assess speech in ""syntactic,"" ""semantic,"" ""pragmatic,"" and ""phonetic"" domains of linguistics. We will introduce cutting- edge innovation to this area of study by assessing these indices using psycholinguistics software developed by Dr. Covington's group so that our ratings of speech abnormalities will be highly objective and ultra-reliable.  Our long-term goal is to develop multivariable models, and new methods for clinical and research settings, based on computational linguistic indices with inherent reliability from automation and proven validity. In this exploratory/developmental study, we will collect detailed symptom ratings from 100 schizophrenia patients, as well as audio-recorded speech samples and neurocognition scores from these patients and 100 controls. This study involves early/conceptual stages of new tools and models that could have a major translational impact. We strive to acquire new knowledge and then put it into action. For example, our new methods could translate into advanced clinical applications (e.g., highly reliable, voice-based monitoring of symptom progression or remission). Furthermore, our new models and methods could be a first step toward promising predictive models (e.g., combinations of factors useful in risk prediction among at-risk youth). These objectives are highly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan. Our 4 aims are to: (1) examine syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic linguistic parameters using computer analysis of speech, and assess their relation to disorganized symptoms; (2) examine phonetic linguistic parameters using computerized Fourier spectrum analysis of speech, and assess their relation to negative symptoms; (3) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts patient versus control status; and (4) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts disorganization scores and negative symptom scores among patients. Given the rich data we will collect, we will also be able to covary the effects of medication and substance use; examine variation in findings based on neutral v. emotionally laden content and spontaneous v. read speech; assess variance in linguistic measures attributable to cognitive domains; and compare results in first-episode and chronic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is an etiologically complex, heterogeneous mental disorder-ranking among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide-with those affected contending with troubling symptoms, major psychosocial problems, unparalleled societal stigma, health disparities, diverse comorbidities, and an average lifespan reduction of 25 years. We propose a study that would significantly advance knowledge of fundamental but under-studied components of the illness-speech/language abnormalities-by examining a broad array of linguistic indices using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (computational linguistics, or computrs objectively, quickly, and ultra- reliably analyzing speech). This exploratory/developmental work could have major public health significance in terms of potential for future, high-impact clinical assessment tools that can be practicably used in routine practice settings, as well as future predictive models for those at high risk of developing schizophrenia.            ",Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia,8512143,R21MH097999,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Automation ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cognition ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Computers ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Phonetics ', ' Psycholinguistic ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Semantics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Sound Sonography ', ' Sound Spectrography ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Speech ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Tongue ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' SKAP55R ', ' SKAP-HOM ', ' SCAP2 ', ' SAPS ', ' RA70 ', ' SCAP2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Assessment Tool ', ' Cognitive ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' computerized ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' Neurocognition ', ' lexical ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' routine practice ', ' biosignature ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,249349,0.07829954004457071
"Tech-Based Depression and Anxiety Treatment for Youth in High Risk Environments The PI¿s career goal is to become an independent investigator developing and evaluating novel interventions for underserved, vulnerable youth with anxiety and depressive disorders. This proposal outlines a plan to achieve this goal, through culmination of the training and research plans into an extremely competitive R01 proposal. The training plan takes full advantage of the candidate¿s strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University¿s Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as relations with the broader community of researchers working with youth in high risk social environments. Training will include multidisciplinary mentorship, coursework, conferences, seminars, systematic professional interactions, readings, collaboration with a youth advisory board, and a mentored publication plan. Training goals necessary to the PI¿s career goal involve growth in: 1) intervention development and evaluation; 2) adolescent psychology; 3) cultural issues pertinent to vulnerable youth; and 4) general career development. This plan builds on the PI¿s background in clinical psychology, which has focused on technology- based treatments for depression and anxiety, contextual models of mental health disparities, implications of co- occurring psychiatric disorders on treatment outcomes, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In this K08, the PI will extend her work to include youth, increasing the impact of her research through earlier intervention. The long-term goal of the research is to open a new avenue to culturally competent care by: 1) applying treatment principles efficacious in general populations to unique concerns of underserved youth facing multiple risks to their physical and mental health; 2) developing a mobile treatment that provides real-time, context- specific intervention; and 3) extending population-level care, via Internet and mobile phone technologies, to youth unable to access existing services. To this end, the research plan will: 1) identify context-specific risk factors for anxiety and depressive symptoms in vulnerable youth; 2) identify treatment targets accordingly; and 3) develop an engaging, accessible intervention tailored to vulnerable adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The intervention, delivered via an advanced mobile phone application, the Internet, and brief telephone support, will be grounded in validated CBT techniques and more recent advances in transdiagnostic CBT. Research aims will be achieved via: 1) Study 1, analysis of an existing longitudinal, epidemiological dataset to identify context-specific social stressors that predict increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and cognitive mechanisms by which the social stressors impact anxiety and depression; 2) Study 2, development, usability testing, and a subsequent feasibility trial of a new, transdiagnostic Internet and mobile phone intervention teaching CBT skills to vulnerable adolescents with MDD and GAD, and applying these skills to targets identified from Study 1; and 3) Study 3, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the intervention to an attention control. Studies 2 and 3 will provide preliminary data for an R01 proposing a larger RCT. The proposed research will identity group-specific intervention targets to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in vulnerable youth, through analysis of an existing longitudinal study in a sample of youth in high risk social environments. Findings will be translated to develop and conduct early testing of an intervention designed to decrease symptoms in vulnerable youth with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder,

"Harvard/Brown Anxiety Program (HARP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental health conditions in the United States. Substantial gaps exist in the literature with respect to the clinical course of anxiety disorders in particular groups of individuals who are continually increasing in prevalence in the U.S. population, particularly African American and Hispanic individuals, and individuals entering older age. Specifically, despite the increasing and substantial number of African American, Hispanic, and older adults in the population, there are no published data on the clinical course of anxiety disorders in these groups of individuals that have been collected using a prospective, short-interval interview, longitudinal, naturalistic design. In this application we propose two timely and needed studies within the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Program (HARP) to address these fundamental gaps in our understanding of the course of anxiety disorders in these understudied populations. First, we propose to expand our newly recruited and prospectively studied sample of African Americans and Hispanics with anxiety disorders to a total of 175 African Americans and 175 Hispanics, and to recruit a contemporaneous sample of 175 non-Hispanic Caucasians, comparable on socioeconomic indicators to the African American and Hispanic samples. The recruitment and prospective, short-interval follow-up of these individuals over the next 5 years will provide the first comprehensive description of the prospective naturalistic course of psychopathology and psychosocial outcomes associated with DSM-IV anxiety disorders and related culture-bound syndromes and symptoms in African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects that are comparable on socioeconomic indicators (AIM 1), as well as examination of predictors of course within each of these three ethnic groups (AIM 2). We will then conduct the first prospective longitudinal test of potential ethnic minority disparities in the course of anxiety disorders (AIM 3) along with the first examination of potential demographic, clinical, environmental stressor, and socio-cultural predictors of ethnic minority disparities in course (AIM 4). Second, we propose to continue observation of members of the original HARP cohort who have been studied for 15 years as they enter older adulthood (all 247 subjects who will reach or exceed the age of 61 during the proposed grant period) to provide new knowledge about the developmental changes that take place in the clinical course of anxiety disorders during the transition to older adulthood (AIMS 5 and 6). We will test the suggestion in the literature, based on epidemiological data, that the course of anxiety disorders improves during the transition to older adulthood; explore the extent to which indicators of declining physical and social wellness may be predictive of worsening course of anxiety disorders as subjects make the transition to older adulthood; and test the hypothesis that those individuals who have had an especially pernicious course of anxiety are at increased risk for age-related cognitive impairment. Taken together, this proposal will provide substantial new clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in understudied individuals in the population.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the increasing numbers of both ethnic minorities and individuals entering older age in the United States, there is a dearth of substantial clinical knowledge about the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, including factors which place them at substantial risk for deleterious health consequences. This project will provide necessary in-depth prospective longitudinal study of the course of anxiety disorders in these groups, and holds promise for providing insight into the factors associated with

"Cross-cultural neuroimaging of emotion in South Africa, Japan and US     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Affective disorders, such as anxiety and depression, affect one out of every four Americans (Kessler & Ustun, 2008), the highest rate in the world. Over $42 billion dollars are spent in the United States each year to treat them (Kessler & Ustun, 2008). Cross-national epidemiological studies conducted by the World Health Organization in 2008 revealed robust population mental health disparities across cultural groups, particularly in prevalence of anxiety and depression, with higher rates of mood disorders typically found in Western (e.g., US) compared to non-Western cultures (e.g., Japan and South Africa). Cross-ethnic epidemiological studies conducted within the United States have found similar population mental health disparities across ethnic groups, with higher rates of affective disorders typically found in Caucasian-Americans compared to African- Americans and Asian-Americans. Despite epidemiological evidence for population mental health disparities across cultural and ethnic groups, the specific role that social and neurobiological mechanisms play in racial differences in the etiology of affective disorders remains unknown. For instance, there do not yet exist any neuroimaging studies of emotion comparing African and non-African responses in either healthy or clinical populations. This is due, in large part, to the lack of research infrastructure in Afria for studying emotional responses in Africans and comparing them to Asians and Caucasians. Our proposed research aims to bridge translational gaps in basic and clinical science by (1) developing research capacity in South Africa in affective neuroscience by creating stimuli and validating cross-site experimental paradigms and (2) using neuroimaging, autonomic and behavioral techniques to study emotional response in three distinct cultural groups: Africans, Caucasian-Americans and Japanese. These proposed studies will build research capacity in affective neuroscience in Africa by providing novel research paradigms and training opportunities for scientists in Africa. Results from these studies have the potential to be among the first to empirically demonstrate a link between racial disparities in affective disorders and sociocultural differences in basic neural mechanisms underlying typical and atypical emotion. Results from these studies also have the potential to make a significant theoretical contribution by outlining novel physiological mechanisms underlying differential emotional response previously observed and reported among minority groups. Findings from the proposed studies may provide the foundation for future grant applications examining the genetic and environmental factors contributing to racial disparities in affective disorders at social, neural ad behavioral levels of analysis. By understanding how cultural values affect neural mechanisms underlying emotional functioning, we may gain further insight into how affective disorders can be both prevented and treated across cultural groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities exist in the prevalence and treatment of affective disorders, medical conditions that affect nearly one in three Americans (Kessler & Ustun, 2008) and present a financial burden of over $42 billion dollars in treatment costs each year in the US (Kessler & Ustun, 2008). The specific aims of the proposed research are to build research capacity in affective neuroscience in South Africa in order to investigate the social and neural mechanisms underlying racial disparities in affective disorders across three cultural groups: Africans in South Africa, Japanese in Japan and Caucasian-Americans in US.                ","Cross-cultural neuroimaging of emotion in South Africa, Japan and US",8411559,R21MH098789,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Emotions ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Japan ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' South Africa ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' World Health Organization ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' African ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' American ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' cultural values ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Validation ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,155683,0.02121742865885346
"Antipsychotics and Vascular Function in Bipolar Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application requests funding to support the training and research activities for Dr. Jess G. Fiedorowicz. His goal is to develop expertise in human cardiovascular physiology for the assessment of vascular function in patients with bipolar disorder. Vascular function represents an important intermediate phenotype in the development of atherosclerosis and has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Bipolar disorders are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The first-line, second- generation antipsychotics associated with weight gain (SGAWGs: risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) have been associated with significant metabolic complications, which may increase risk for vascular disease. Assessment of vascular function may allow identification of clinically relevant mechanisms for the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with bipolar disorder. This research and training plan strongly emphasizes interdisciplinary and translational research as outlined by the NIH Roadmap.  As a psychiatrist, Dr. Fiedorowicz seeks additional training in translational research applications in human vascular physiology and pharmacology, related statistical methodologies, and the ethical conduct and design of research. The research plan proposes a 26-week, prospective, naturalistic cohort study to examine the relationship of SGAWG use and vascular function in bipolar disorders by studying incident users of SGAWGs and non-users of antipsychotics with bipolar disorders. The primary aim of this study is to determine the magnitude and timeline of antipsychotic-induced changes in vascular function in incident users of SGAWGs. The methodology employed will allow for mechanistic investigation with particular focus on insulin resistance and visceral obesity. This application will provide a foundation for Dr. Fiedorowicz' long-term scientific goal of creating an independent program of interdisciplinary research addressing cardiovascular disease in bipolar disorders and the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychotropic medications.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals with bipolar disorder bear an excess risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Some medications used to treat bipolar disorder may worsen risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This research addresses the NIMH goals of developing safer treatments and eliminating the health disparities associated with mental illness, namely the cardiovascular burden.

"Hormones & Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist- clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child- bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute, Each of four Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women or the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education and development of junior investigators who would commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-specific treatment approaches and public awareness as to the importance of these sex-specific health issues for families and society.

"Characterization of the PAD Symptom Experience    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic occlusive disease affecting more than 8 million Americans, a number expected to rise sharply due to an aging population. PAD causes insufficient blood flow to the legs, which leads to debilitating, activity-induced, ischemic pain (i.e. claudication). Although health care providers consider claudication the hallmark symptom of PAD, it is reported by less than 29% of PAD patients. When individuals report symptoms inconsistent with ""classic claudication,"" provider suspicion of disease presence is not triggered; therefore patients do not receive the necessary diagnostic testing and subsequent diagnosis. The breadth of PAD symptom experiences based on age and gender is poorly understood, but is a crucial component to providing timely diagnosis and treatment in an attempt to prevent amputation, heart attack, stroke, and death. Consistent with the scientific mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research to expand nursing science by integrating the biological and behavioral sciences, the proposed study utilizes a mixed methods approach to provide an integrated, comprehensive, and biobehavioral understanding of the PAD symptom experience. Subjective data will be obtained through in-depth interviews and symptom reports during treadmill walking. Objective, physiologic data related to ischemic changes in calf skeletal muscle will be obtained during treadmill walking. The objectives of the proposed descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional study are to elicit a comprehensive description of PAD symptoms and related physiologic data, and to determine the degree of correspondence to delineate causative mechanisms underlying symptoms (an NINR area of emphasis). This study will provide a comprehensive and accurate description of the subjective PAD symptom experience and will, for the first time, simultaneously evaluate subjective symptoms and objective physiologic ischemic changes in working skeletal muscles. This study has significant implications for the improvement of PAD assessment and diagnosis to optimize health by broadening currently accepted symptom descriptors, and to reduce health disparities by identifying age and gender differences in PAD symptom experiences. This study is foundational for future research to determine patterns of ischemia, their relationship to symptom report, and potential changes with therapeutic interventions, leading to the long term goal of developing and refining gender and age specific screening tools. The knowledge gained from this study has significant public health implications for the over 8 million undertreated, debilitated, and at-risk Americans that suffer daily from this painful, deadly, and life limiting disease--improving detection, diagnosis, and treatment.        Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 8 million Americans and places individuals at an increased risk for amputation, heart attack, stroke, and death. Current clinician diagnosis is primarily based on the presence of classic claudication, pain in the calf, thigh or buttock area that comes on with exercise and is easily relieved with rest. This study will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how older and younger men and women with PAD experience symptoms to increase PAD detection and provide timely treatment, improving the quality of life and life expectancy of individuals afflicted with PAD.

"Targeting School Climate and Children?s Behavioral Health in Urban Schools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unmet need for mental health services is extraordinarily high among urban children of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. As overall need continues to rise, schools are fast becoming the main source of mental health services for children. Externalizing behavior disorders and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in low-income urban children. Unfortunately, evidence-based interventions (EBI) for those disorders are seldom employed in urban schools. School-Wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS), a multi-level services delivery strategy that combines universal and targeted interventions, has been found to be effective in improving school climate, perceived school safety, and student reading scores. Targeted group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) can be provided to at-risk and high-risk students as part of the SWPBS system. Unfortunately, SWPBS and GCBT are seldom employed in under-resourced urban schools, in part, because school districts do not have enough resources to contract outside providers with expertise in EBIs for behavioral health problems. Also, widespread deployment of EBIs to ""real world"" settings has been hampered by problems such as inadequate training of service providers and poor implementation fidelity. The creation of mechanisms for the training and support of counselors and other school personnel that focus on maintaining high implementation fidelity and integrity can facilitate a significant increase in the use of EBIs in urban schools and contribute to lowering behavioral health disparities.  The overall purpose of this project is to determine whether school personnel implementing a two-tier SWPBS program for typically developing children and children with, or at risk for, externalizing or anxiety disorders, can implement the components of the program with the same level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness when they receive a Low Level of Support (LLS) from their coaches and supervisors as compared to a High Level of Support (HLS). We also want to determine whether school personnel who receive HLS for two years could continue to implement the components of the program with a similar level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness while receiving LLS during the following two years. We will calculate the total costs and net costs associated with the development and implementation of the SWPBS program. The study uses a cohort-sequential design and follows 6 separate K-8 schools in the Philadelphia School District, yielding approximately 48 leadership team members, 180 school personnel, and 3,900 students in Tier 1, and 12 counselors, 84 groups of 4-5 children with, or at risk for, oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder in each CBT group, and 3-4 children with, or at risk for, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, o social phobia in each CBT group, for a total of 306 evaluable child participants.

"Binge Eating Disorder in an Ethnically Diverse Treatment-Seeking Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Binge eating disorder (BED) is a clinically impairing condition characterized by recurrent out-of-control eating episodes and painful cognitive concerns regarding body shape and weight. BED appears to be equally prevalent across racial/ethnic groups including African Americans, Latinos, and Caucasians, and shows associations with obesity in all racial/ethnic groups. Ethnic minorities with BED are less likely t receive treatment, and most commonly seek treatment for weight management as opposed to mental health issues. Minimal data are available concerning treatment-seeking ethnic minorities with BED. This study aims to describe and compare the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of African American, Latino, and Caucasian patients with BED presenting for treatment at an urban, ethnically-diverse, community-hospital center for nutrition and weight management. The study will use self-report questionnaire methods, and all new intakes will be recruited for participation. Data concerning body mass index (BMI), treatment retention and response after six months will be collected from participants' hospital charts. Data will be collected from N=750 consecutive, consenting presenting for weight management. Prevalence estimates and hospital intake data suggest n=260 of the new intakes will receive a diagnosis of BED, including n=110 African American participants, n=90 Caucasian participants, and n=60 Latino/Hispanic participants. The first aim is to compare racial/ethnic groups regarding demographic variables, BMI, symptoms of binge eating, cognitive symptoms of BED, associated psychiatric issues, self-stigma, level of stress, and reasons for seeking treatment. The second aim is to examine the relative influence of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, readiness for treatment, self-stigma, and stress on treatment retention and response. The third aim is to examine the generalizability of data from treatment efficacy trials by comparing data from this study to the data included in an aggregated database from twelve randomized, controlled trials of psychosocial treatments for BED created with NIMH funding in a study conducted at Boston University and available to the PI. [To further contextualize the data, participants in this study will be compared to individuals with BED included in a publically accessible epidemiological database.] The results from this study will address a severe lack of information regarding treatment-seeking ethnic minorities with BED at the most common point of entry to relevant health services for this population. Data concerning the symptoms, treatment retention and motivation in minority groups are crucial to informing successful provision of health services and addressing related health disparities. This fellowship will also support an underrepresented minority in a research field-psychopathology and treatment of eating disorders-that has few racial/ethnic minorities among its academic researchers.          Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is a clinically impairing condition that appears to be prevalent across all ethnic groups; however, there are very little data on the topic of BED among treatment-seeking ethnic minorities. The current study aims to identify the clinical epidemiology of BED in an under-researched health services delivery setting (i.e., an urban community hospital weigh management program), where ethnic minorities with BED are most likely to seek treatment. These data concerning symptoms, motivation for treatment, mutable predictors of treatment retention and response in minority groups are crucial to informing successful provision of health services.

"Effects of Social Context, Culture and Minority Status on Depression and Anxiety     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project investigates the social mechanisms behind ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence of major depression disorder (MDD) and depressive and anxiety symptoms (DAS) in Latino young adults (ages 17-25). We propose to extend the path-breaking Boricua study to examine if experiences of minority status and acculturation are causally linked to differences in prevalence of MDD/DAS across Island versus mainland Puerto Ricans. Since Puerto Ricans are a minority in the South Bronx in NY but a majority on the Island of Puerto Rico, this migrant study design enables us to use variation across sites as a way to examine the causal mechanism of minority status and acculturation on mental health outcomes. Our planned study also includes a wide range of environmental, social, family, and individual level measures associated with MDD and DAS, and uses advanced statistical techniques to identify the risks and protective factors for these negative outcomes. We propose to conduct follow-up interviews with parents and with young adults now ages 17-25 who participated in the Boricua study. Using these data, we will conduct quantitative analysis to: 1) determine the causal impact of minority status as contrasted to majority status, 2) identify the mechanisms behind the effect of minority status on subsequent MDD and DAS, and 3) test conditions that moderate the causal link between minority status and environmental and social context. We will supplement the quantitative analysis with in- depth qualitative interviews and ethnographic neighborhood observation to deepen our understanding of the quantitative findings and identify minority status experiences and acculturation stresses potentially related to changes in MDD and DAS, as well as functional impairment. At the close of our study we intend to create a public-use database of the four waves of Boricua study. This would be the first longitudinal study to assess the causal effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young adult mental illness. Our ultimate goal is to generate information to reduce mental illness in minority communities.          The proposed longitudinal project is the first to investigate the long-term effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young-adult mental illness. It holds much promise for understanding the individual, family and neighborhood-level factors to target for interventions to prevent the onset of major depression disorder and anxiety and depressive symptoms in minority youth and young adults.

"Fostering Supported Education and Employment in First Episode Psychosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All young persons are faced with the decision of how to invest in their human capital development; this normative tension is particularly pronounced for young persons who have experienced a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Interruptions in their education and employment following FEP can lead not only to poor socioeconomic outcomes, but also impair psychiatric recovery. FEP treatment programs have demonstrated effectiveness in improving outcomes and reducing the probability of disability for newly-diagnosed young persons with schizophrenia and related disorders. FEP programs have indicated a need for knowledge to help clients navigate the developmental milestone of choosing investments in school and work. Training Plan: This K01 Award will train the candidate to become an independent investigator conducting policy analysis to improve psychiatric and socioeconomic outcomes for persons with psychiatric disorders. This K01 will provide training in 1) clinical and policy elements of FEP treatment and 2) SEE services, 3) the impact of racial/ethnic disparities on SEE access and engagement, and 4) methodological training in mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods data collection and analysis. These skills, combined with my quantitative analysis training and commitment to promoting socioeconomic recovery of individuals with psychiatric disorders, will give me the tools I need to launch an independent research career. Research Plan: This study will develop policy recommendations to help policymakers and program leaders identify how best to provide SEE services to clients with FEP, to enable clients to make a meaningful choice of SEE services. The Specific Aims are: 1) To identify predictors of human capital attainment in a population-based survey among persons who report symptoms of psychosis, prior to the availability of comprehensive FEP programs; 2) To identify predictors, barriers, and challenges to the use of SEE services in FEP treatment programs; and 3) To examine SEE and FEP service utilization patterns over the duration of FEP treatment. Methodology: The mentored research project will encompass secondary data analyses from a nationally-representative sample of US adults (the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys), from the Improving Work Outcomes study at the University of California Los Angeles, and from the New York State initiative, OnTrackNY. Primary data will be collected from semi-structured interviews with program staff at existing FEP programs, and staff and clients at the New York State OnTrackNY initiative. A meta-analysis will be conducted with data from OnTrackNY and the Recovering After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Connection. At the conclusion of the K01, the findings will be reviewed by OnTrackNY leadership, to lay out a series of policy options that can help to improve SEE service delivery and utilization. The policy environment is ripe for identifying models that can lead to long-term improvements in psychiatric functioning and reduce disability, and could be expanded to young adults with other psychiatric disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses Objective 3, Strategy 3.4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan: Identify and systematically study elements of personalized mental health care.

"Targeting School Climate and Children?s Behavioral Health in Urban Schools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unmet need for mental health services is extraordinarily high among urban children of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. As overall need continues to rise, schools are fast becoming the main source of mental health services for children. Externalizing behavior disorders and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in low-income urban children. Unfortunately, evidence-based interventions (EBI) for those disorders are seldom employed in urban schools. School-Wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS), a multi-level services delivery strategy that combines universal and targeted interventions, has been found to be effective in improving school climate, perceived school safety, and student reading scores. Targeted group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) can be provided to at-risk and high-risk students as part of the SWPBS system. Unfortunately, SWPBS and GCBT are seldom employed in under-resourced urban schools, in part, because school districts do not have enough resources to contract outside providers with expertise in EBIs for behavioral health problems. Also, widespread deployment of EBIs to ""real world"" settings has been hampered by problems such as inadequate training of service providers and poor implementation fidelity. The creation of mechanisms for the training and support of counselors and other school personnel that focus on maintaining high implementation fidelity and integrity can facilitate a significant increase in the use of EBIs in urban schools and contribute to lowering behavioral health disparities.  The overall purpose of this project is to determine whether school personnel implementing a two-tier SWPBS program for typically developing children and children with, or at risk for, externalizing or anxiety disorders, can implement the components of the program with the same level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness when they receive a Low Level of Support (LLS) from their coaches and supervisors as compared to a High Level of Support (HLS). We also want to determine whether school personnel who receive HLS for two years could continue to implement the components of the program with a similar level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness while receiving LLS during the following two years. We will calculate the total costs and net costs associated with the development and implementation of the SWPBS program. The study uses a cohort-sequential design and follows 6 separate K-8 schools in the Philadelphia School District, yielding approximately 48 leadership team members, 180 school personnel, and 3,900 students in Tier 1, and 12 counselors, 84 groups of 4-5 children with, or at risk for, oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder in each CBT group, and 3-4 children with, or at risk for, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, o social phobia in each CBT group, for a total of 306 evaluable child participants. Schools will be randomly assigned to receive either HLS or LLS from project staff.

"Center for Adaptive Leadership in Symptom Science     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Center of Excellence (P30) will promote biobehavioral research to extend symptom science using the Adaptive Leadership (AL) framework to conceptualize and study cognitive/affective symptoms in chronic illness. The overall Center aims are to:    (1) Enhance and sustain the productivity of new nursing scientists engaged in interdisciplinary  biobehavioral research to understand and ameliorate symptoms, symptom distress, and symptom  sequelae using adaptive approaches for people with cognitive/affective changes in chronic illness;  (2) Assist investigators to tailor research approaches and interventions to optimize research  participation by people with cognitive/affective changes by addressing minority health issues and  refining existing, or creating new intervention protocols and self-report measures (i.e.,  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS].  (3) Increase investigator competence in using longitudinal quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches to examine the trajectories of symptoms, symptom sequelae and patient adaptation associated with cognitive/affective changes.    The work of the Center will be carried by in three Cores, the Administrative Core, the Mentoring and Scholarship Core, and the Design and Methods Core. Expected outcomes of the center include  studies of trajectories of cognitive/affective symptoms and symptom sequelae to describe patterns,  variability, and change over time to gain knowledge needed about critical periods or transition points  for timing of interventions, identify differences within subpopulatios such as those with varying levels  of cognitive ability or minority health needs, and generate knowledge for developing/testing  interventions to enhance patients' adaptive capabilities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Barriers to care arise for people with cognitive/affective changes because they may not clearly convey concerns or communicate easily. If not addressed through research, these barriers will create health disparities.

Our planned study also includes a wide range of environmental, social, family, and individual level measures associated with MDD and DAS, and uses advanced statistical techniques to identify the risks and protective factors for these negative outcomes. We propose to conduct follow-up interviews with parents and with young adults now ages 17-25 who participated in the Boricua study. Using these data, we will conduct quantitative analysis to: 1) determine the causal impact of minority status as contrasted to majority status, 2) identify the mechanisms behind the effect of minority status on subsequent MDD and DAS, and 3) test conditions that moderate the causal link between minority status and environmental and social context. We will supplement the quantitative analysis with in- depth qualitative interviews and ethnographic neighborhood observation to deepen our understanding of the quantitative findings and identify minority status experiences and acculturation stresses potentially related to changes in MDD and DAS, as well as functional impairment. At the close of our study we intend to create a public-use database of the four waves of Boricua study. This would be the first longitudinal study to assess the causal effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young adult mental illness. Our ultimate goal is to generate information to reduce mental illness in minority communities. The proposed longitudinal project is the first to investigate the long-term effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young-adult mental illness. It holds much promise for understanding the individual, family and neighborhood-level factors to target for interventions to prevent the onset of major depression disorder and anxiety and depressive symptoms in minority youth and young adults.","Effects of Social Context, Culture and Minority Status on Depression and Anxiety",8870755,R01MH098374,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Asian Americans ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Island ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Site ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' mental development ', ' Participant ', ' Community based prevention ', ' member ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Stratification ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' critical period ', ' early adolescence ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIMH,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,R01,2014,64573,-0.009434933738753568
"Antipsychotics and Vascular Function in Bipolar Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application requests funding to support the training and research activities for Dr. Jess G. Fiedorowicz. His goal is to develop expertise in human cardiovascular physiology for the assessment of vascular function in patients with bipolar disorder. Vascular function represents an important intermediate phenotype in the development of atherosclerosis and has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Bipolar disorders are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The first-line, second- generation antipsychotics associated with weight gain (SGAWGs: risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) have been associated with significant metabolic complications, which may increase risk for vascular disease. Assessment of vascular function may allow identification of clinically relevant mechanisms for the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with bipolar disorder. This research and training plan strongly emphasizes interdisciplinary and translational research as outlined by the NIH Roadmap.  As a psychiatrist, Dr. Fiedorowicz seeks additional training in translational research applications in human vascular physiology and pharmacology, related statistical methodologies, and the ethical conduct and design of research. The research plan proposes a 26-week, prospective, naturalistic cohort study to examine the relationship of SGAWG use and vascular function in bipolar disorders by studying incident users of SGAWGs and non-users of antipsychotics with bipolar disorders. The primary aim of this study is to determine the magnitude and timeline of antipsychotic-induced changes in vascular function in incident users of SGAWGs. The methodology employed will allow for mechanistic investigation with particular focus on insulin resistance and visceral obesity. This application will provide a foundation for Dr. Fiedorowicz' long-term scientific goal of creating an independent program of interdisciplinary research addressing cardiovascular disease in bipolar disorders and the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychotropic medications.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals with bipolar disorder bear an excess risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Some medications used to treat bipolar disorder may worsen risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This research addresses the NIMH goals of developing safer treatments and eliminating the health disparities associated with mental illness, namely the cardiovascular burden.

"Hormones & Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of development and throughout aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist- clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of specific disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female-specific periods such as child- bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health & Gender Biology at Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute, Each of four Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interest. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either the known higher incidence in women than men and/or differential expression in women or the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian & uterine). By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we would argue that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education and development of junior investigators who would commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-specific treatment approaches and public awareness as to the importance of these sex-specific health issues for families and society.",Hormones & Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside,8719136,K12HD051959,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Biology ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Genes ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Israel ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' human puberty ', ' Puberty ', ' Reading ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Training Programs ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' base ', ' career ', ' Ovarian ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Endocrine ', ' interest ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench to bedside ', ' translational approach ', ' treatment response ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2014,500000,0.07556006098048261
"Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a uniquely human disorder with specific effects on the uniquely human capacity of language. Indeed, the gross and subtle language abnormalities of schizophrenia can be seen as fundamental illness components, perhaps even as part of a ""biosignature."" Bringing modern linguistics knowledge and tools to this disorder is a promising approach. We have formed a unique, inter-disciplinary collaboration (Dr. Compton, a schizophrenia researcher; Dr. Covington, a computational linguist; Dr. Lunden, a linguist specializing in phonetics; Dr. Cleary, a statistician; and Dr. Blanchard, an expert in measuring negative symptoms) to study some of the most perplexing and disabling facets of schizophrenia, the language/speech abnormalities linked closely to disorganization and negative symptoms. We will analyze speech abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and unaffected controls. Rather than examining a single linguistic parameter, we will assess speech in ""syntactic,"" ""semantic,"" ""pragmatic,"" and ""phonetic"" domains of linguistics. We will introduce cutting- edge innovation to this area of study by assessing these indices using psycholinguistics software developed by Dr. Covington's group so that our ratings of speech abnormalities will be highly objective and ultra-reliable.  Our long-term goal is to develop multivariable models, and new methods for clinical and research settings, based on computational linguistic indices with inherent reliability from automation and proven validity. In this exploratory/developmental study, we will collect detailed symptom ratings from 100 schizophrenia patients, as well as audio-recorded speech samples and neurocognition scores from these patients and 100 controls. This study involves early/conceptual stages of new tools and models that could have a major translational impact. We strive to acquire new knowledge and then put it into action. For example, our new methods could translate into advanced clinical applications (e.g., highly reliable, voice-based monitoring of symptom progression or remission). Furthermore, our new models and methods could be a first step toward promising predictive models (e.g., combinations of factors useful in risk prediction among at-risk youth). These objectives are highly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan. Our 4 aims are to: (1) examine syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic linguistic parameters using computer analysis of speech, and assess their relation to disorganized symptoms; (2) examine phonetic linguistic parameters using computerized Fourier spectrum analysis of speech, and assess their relation to negative symptoms; (3) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts patient versus control status; and (4) determine the combination of psycholinguistic parameters that best predicts disorganization scores and negative symptom scores among patients. Given the rich data we will collect, we will also be able to covary the effects of medication and substance use; examine variation in findings based on neutral v. emotionally laden content and spontaneous v. read speech; assess variance in linguistic measures attributable to cognitive domains; and compare results in first-episode and chronic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Schizophrenia is an etiologically complex, heterogeneous mental disorder-ranking among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide-with those affected contending with troubling symptoms, major psychosocial problems, unparalleled societal stigma, health disparities, diverse comorbidities, and an average lifespan reduction of 25 years. We propose a study that would significantly advance knowledge of fundamental but under-studied components of the illness-speech/language abnormalities-by examining a broad array of linguistic indices using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (computational linguistics, or computrs objectively, quickly, and ultra- reliably analyzing speech). This exploratory/developmental work could have major public health significance in terms of potential for future, high-impact clinical assessment tools that can be practicably used in routine practice settings, as well as future predictive models for those at high risk of developing schizophrenia.",Applying Computational Linguistics to Fundamental Components of Schizophrenia,8792658,R21MH097999,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Automation ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cognition ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Computers ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Phonetics ', ' Psycholinguistic ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Semantics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Sound Sonography ', ' Sound Spectrography ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Speech ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Tongue ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' SKAP55R ', ' SKAP-HOM ', ' SCAP2 ', ' SAPS ', ' RA70 ', ' SCAP2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Assessment Tool ', ' Cognitive ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' computerized ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' Neurocognition ', ' lexical ', ' high risk ', ' treatment response ', ' routine practice ', ' biosignature ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' ']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2014,192679,0.07829954004457071
"Lifecourse cardiovascular risk, depression and cognition in black & white adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive function and depressive symptoms share many cardiovascular origins and their prevalence increases dramatically with age. Emerging evidence suggests that the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes progresses over the life course and may be different in older adults compared to middle-aged and younger adults. Racial disparities in cardiovascular risk factors and the age at which they develop may further exacerbate these associations. This 5-year K01 award application seeks to improve our knowledge of the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive function and depressive symptoms over the life course in black and white adults. Additionally, this proposal will elucidate the role of cardiovascular risk factors with underlying structural brain changes over the life course. This proposal involves analyses of two large biracial epidemiologic cohorts: including 1) the ongoing CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study of 5,115 young adult to middle-aged men and women (52% blacks and 48% whites), and 2) the ongoing Health ABC (Health, Aging and Body Composition) study of 3,075 older adult men and women (42% blacks and 58% whites). We hypothesize that greater exposure to non-optimal cardiovascular measures will be associated with worse cognitive function, greater number of depressive symptoms, and worse structural brain indices such as greater white matter lesions and hippocampal atrophy across the life course in blacks and whites. The data structure of the cohorts will enable us to evaluate several life course epidemiologic models such as early vs. late life cardiovascular exposure, with the possibility of evaluating sensitive periods. This life course approach is mirrored in the scientifi aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, we will determine how young adulthood and midlife cardiovascular exposure (CARDIA) and late life cardiovascular exposure (Health ABC) influence trajectories of depressive symptoms. In Aims 2 and 3, we will determine how young adulthood cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive performance and structural brain integrity at midlife (CARDIA) and how late life cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive decline and structural brain integrity in late life (Health ABC). The proposed analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan that will (1) advance my conceptual training in the clinical aspect of cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular aspects in particular; (2) train me in neuroimaging and markers of structural brain integrity; and (3) advance my methodologic training in longitudinal and neuroimaging related statistical methods and my knowledge of life course models. My training plan will include formal courses, clinical assessment and grand rounds, attendance at scholarly seminars, directed readings and professional development activities specifically tailored to my training goals. Having the K01 support will result in preliminary data and the mentoring necessary to establish myself more strongly as an independent investigator and promote the development of a successful R01 application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive function and depressive symptoms progresses over the life course and may be different in older adults compared to younger adults, with evidence of racial disparity in these associations. This study will address the life course nature of the associations of cardiovascular risk factors with cognitive function and depressive symptoms in black and white adults, and additionally the role of structural brain changes in these associations.              ","Lifecourse cardiovascular risk, depression and cognition in black & white adults",8678791,K01AG047273,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Body Composition ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropathology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' feeding ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' hippocampal atropy ', ' hippocampal atrophy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' data structure ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2014,53386,0.004443592554495501
"Palliative Care Symptom Management in Rural Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Palliative care aims to provide relief of pain and other patient symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, and depression, in order to improve quality of life. Patients in isolated rural settings often lack easy access to palliative care and other specialist services. Yet rural residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to be older; be in poorer overall health; suffer from more chronic or serious illnesses and disabilities; be uninsured or underinsured; and live in poverty. Telehealth is an emerging method of health care delivery that has been found useful and effective in many clinical settings and specialties. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and increase access to specialist care in rural settings. We propose a cluster randomized clinical trial design to test the effects of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care symptom-management program for 288 cancer patients and 96 providers in rural health care settings. The proposed program will provide services to both patients and providers: Patients will conduct self-assessments and report pain and other symptoms via telehealth. Health care providers will receive telehealth-delivered case consultations that will include case management, evidence-based practice resources, and peer support. Providers and their patients will be randomly assigned to intervention groups, which receive the telehealth- enhanced palliative care symptom-management intervention, or to control groups. Our primary aim is to compare patient self-reports of symptoms and quality of life in the intervention and control groups over 2 months. Aim 2 is to examine, in the intervention and control groups over 2 months, providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding symptoms and perceived competence in treating symptoms. Aim 3 is to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. We will use mixed effects models with patients nested within providers to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes. Findings from this study will be instrumental in advancing telehealth and improving symptom management and palliative care among underserved rural populations.        Rural patients face many health disparities, including challenges in obtaining palliative care for relief of pain and other distressing symptoms.

"Effects of Social Context, Culture and Minority Status on Depression and Anxiety     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project investigates the social mechanisms behind ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence of major depression disorder (MDD) and depressive and anxiety symptoms (DAS) in Latino young adults (ages 17-25). We propose to extend the path-breaking Boricua study to examine if experiences of minority status and acculturation are causally linked to differences in prevalence of MDD/DAS across Island versus mainland Puerto Ricans. Since Puerto Ricans are a minority in the South Bronx in NY but a majority on the Island of Puerto Rico, this migrant study design enables us to use variation across sites as a way to examine the causal mechanism of minority status and acculturation on mental health outcomes. Our planned study also includes a wide range of environmental, social, family, and individual level measures associated with MDD and DAS, and uses advanced statistical techniques to identify the risks and protective factors for these negative outcomes. We propose to conduct follow-up interviews with parents and with young adults now ages 17-25 who participated in the Boricua study. Using these data, we will conduct quantitative analysis to: 1) determine the causal impact of minority status as contrasted to majority status, 2) identify the mechanisms behind the effect of minority status on subsequent MDD and DAS, and 3) test conditions that moderate the causal link between minority status and environmental and social context. We will supplement the quantitative analysis with in- depth qualitative interviews and ethnographic neighborhood observation to deepen our understanding of the quantitative findings and identify minority status experiences and acculturation stresses potentially related to changes in MDD and DAS, as well as functional impairment. At the close of our study we intend to create a public-use database of the four waves of Boricua study. This would be the first longitudinal study to assess the causal effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young adult mental illness. Our ultimate goal is to generate information to reduce mental illness in minority communities.          The proposed longitudinal project is the first to investigate the long-term effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young-adult mental illness. It holds much promise for understanding the individual, family and neighborhood-level factors to target for interventions to prevent the onset of major depression disorder and anxiety and depressive symptoms in minority youth and young adults.

"Standard versus Culturally-Modified ADHD Treatment  Abstract Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorders in children, affecting approximately 5% of youth (APA, 2013). The long-term, developmental trajectory of ADHD suggests that these children continue to experience debilitating symptoms, as well as significant academic, social, and family difficulties into adulthood (Biederman et al., 2012). Given the impact of functional impairment associated with ADHD on the individual and society, it is imperative that effective treatment for ADHD be made available to as many affected youth as possible. In light of staggering mental health disparities for some of the fast growing ethnic minority groups in the United States, such as Latinos, it is particularly important to ensure effective treatment is available to these children who have not been well represented in treatment outcome studies examining parent management training for ADHD or other externalizing disorders (Flores & TCOPR, 2010; Miranda et al., 2005; U.S. Census Bureau, 2008).Thus, consistent with the goals of an R21, the current pilot study aims to close the existing gap in our knowledge about effective psychosocial treatments for Latino families by providing preliminary data regarding the acceptability and efficacy of a culturally-modified treatment and possible moderators that will support a future R01. Specifically, the current pilot study is the first step in a larger program of research aimed at definitively determining if culturally-modified treatment outperforms standard treatment when examining engagement and acceptability outcomes, as well as symptomatology and parental functioning, and if so, which treatment modifications are necessary and for whom. Participants will be 60 Latino children with ADHD and their parents. Families will receive either standard evidence-based treatment or culturally-modified treatment. The following aims will be explored: 1) does culturally-modified treatment result in better engagement and acceptability outcomes (i.e., parental attendance, retention, engagement, and satisfaction) than standard treatment and what is the strength of these effects, 2) does culturally-modified treatment result in improvements in ADHD symptomatology, as well as parental functioning (i.e., parenting stress and efficacy), does the modified treatment result in similar or greater improvements than standard treatment, and what is the strength of these effects, and 3) what possible moderators (i.e., socioeconomic status and behavioral and cognitive acculturation) may explain the relationship between treatment type (i.e., standard versus culturally-modified) and outcomes and what is the strength of these interactions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current pilot study aims to provide preliminary data regarding the acceptability and efficacy of a culturally- modified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) treatment relative to standard treatment for Latino families. Results will impact public health by 1) addressing the mental health disparities that exist for the rapidly growing Latino population in this country (Flores & TCOPR, 2010; U.S. Census Bureau, 2008) and 2) targeting one of the most common mental health disorders in childhood that results in debilitating symptoms lasting into adulthood (APA, 2013; Biederman et al., 2012).            ",Standard versus Culturally-Modified ADHD Treatment,8750127,R21HD078553,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Positive Reinforcements ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Token Reinforcement ', ' Token Economy ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,222436,-0.022237595198525775
"Tech-Based Depression and Anxiety Treatment for Youth in High Risk Environments The PI¿s career goal is to become an independent investigator developing and evaluating novel interventions for underserved, vulnerable youth with anxiety and depressive disorders. This proposal outlines a plan to achieve this goal, through culmination of the training and research plans into an extremely competitive R01 proposal. The training plan takes full advantage of the candidate¿s strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University¿s Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as relations with the broader community of researchers working with youth in high risk social environments. Training will include multidisciplinary mentorship, coursework, conferences, seminars, systematic professional interactions, readings, collaboration with a youth advisory board, and a mentored publication plan. Training goals necessary to the PI¿s career goal involve growth in: 1) intervention development and evaluation; 2) adolescent psychology; 3) cultural issues pertinent to vulnerable youth; and 4) general career development. This plan builds on the PI¿s background in clinical psychology, which has focused on technology- based treatments for depression and anxiety, contextual models of mental health disparities, implications of co- occurring psychiatric disorders on treatment outcomes, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In this K08, the PI will extend her work to include youth, increasing the impact of her research through earlier intervention. The long-term goal of the research is to open a new avenue to culturally competent care by: 1) applying treatment principles efficacious in general populations to unique concerns of underserved youth facing multiple risks to their physical and mental health; 2) developing a mobile treatment that provides real-time, context- specific intervention; and 3) extending population-level care, via Internet and mobile phone technologies, to youth unable to access existing services. To this end, the research plan will: 1) identify context-specific risk factors for anxiety and depressive symptoms in vulnerable youth; 2) identify treatment targets accordingly; and 3) develop an engaging, accessible intervention tailored to vulnerable adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The intervention, delivered via an advanced mobile phone application, the Internet, and brief telephone support, will be grounded in validated CBT techniques and more recent advances in transdiagnostic CBT. Research aims will be achieved via: 1) Study 1, analysis of an existing longitudinal, epidemiological dataset to identify context-specific social stressors that predict increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and cognitive mechanisms by which the social stressors impact anxiety and depression; 2) Study 2, development, usability testing, and a subsequent feasibility trial of a new, transdiagnostic Internet and mobile phone intervention teaching CBT skills to vulnerable adolescents with MDD and GAD, and applying these skills to targets identified from Study 1; and 3) Study 3, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the intervention to an attention control. Studies 2 and 3 will provide preliminary data for an R01 proposing a larger RCT. The proposed research will identity group-specific intervention targets to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in vulnerable youth, through analysis of an existing longitudinal study in a sample of youth in high risk social environments. Findings will be translated to develop and conduct early testing of an intervention designed to decrease symptoms in vulnerable youth with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder,

"Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan, from development through aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female- specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each of the two Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interests. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either their known higher incidence and/or differential expression in women than men and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we believe that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education, training, and development of junior investigators who will commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-dependent treatment approaches and public awareness of the importance of these sex-dependent health issues for families and society.                ",Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside,8991806,K12HD051959,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Biology ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Genes ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Israel ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' human puberty ', ' Puberty ', ' Reading ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Training Programs ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Endocrine ', ' interest ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench to bedside ', ' translational approach ', ' treatment response ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2015,378000,0.07466664792192776
"Targeting School Climate and Children's Behavioral Health in Urban Schools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unmet need for mental health services is extraordinarily high among urban children of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. As overall need continues to rise, schools are fast becoming the main source of mental health services for children. Externalizing behavior disorders and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in low-income urban children. Unfortunately, evidence-based interventions (EBI) for those disorders are seldom employed in urban schools. School-Wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS), a multi-level services delivery strategy that combines universal and targeted interventions, has been found to be effective in improving school climate, perceived school safety, and student reading scores. Targeted group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) can be provided to at-risk and high-risk students as part of the SWPBS system. Unfortunately, SWPBS and GCBT are seldom employed in under-resourced urban schools, in part, because school districts do not have enough resources to contract outside providers with expertise in EBIs for behavioral health problems. Also, widespread deployment of EBIs to ""real world"" settings has been hampered by problems such as inadequate training of service providers and poor implementation fidelity. The creation of mechanisms for the training and support of counselors and other school personnel that focus on maintaining high implementation fidelity and integrity can facilitate a significant increase in the use of EBIs in urban schools and contribute to lowering behavioral health disparities.  The overall purpose of this project is to determine whether school personnel implementing a two-tier SWPBS program for typically developing children and children with, or at risk for, externalizing or anxiety disorders, can implement the components of the program with the same level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness when they receive a Low Level of Support (LLS) from their coaches and supervisors as compared to a High Level of Support (HLS). We also want to determine whether school personnel who receive HLS for two years could continue to implement the components of the program with a similar level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness while receiving LLS during the following two years. We will calculate the total costs and net costs associated with the development and implementation of the SWPBS program. The study uses a cohort-sequential design and follows 6 separate K-8 schools in the Philadelphia School District, yielding approximately 48 leadership team members, 180 school personnel, and 3,900 students in Tier 1, and 12 counselors, 84 groups of 4-5 children with, or at risk for, oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder in each CBT group, and 3-4 children with, or at risk for, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, o social phobia in each CBT group, for a total of 306 evaluable child participants.

"Palliative Care Symptom Management in Rural Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Palliative care aims to provide relief of pain and other patient symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, and depression, in order to improve quality of life. Patients in isolated rural settings often lack easy access to palliative care and other specialist services. Yet rural residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to be older; be in poorer overall health; suffer from more chronic or serious illnesses and disabilities; be uninsured or underinsured; and live in poverty. Telehealth is an emerging method of health care delivery that has been found useful and effective in many clinical settings and specialties. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and increase access to specialist care in rural settings. We propose a cluster randomized clinical trial design to test the effects of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care symptom-management program for 288 cancer patients and 96 providers in rural health care settings. The proposed program will provide services to both patients and providers: Patients will conduct self-assessments and report pain and other symptoms via telehealth. Health care providers will receive telehealth-delivered case consultations that will include case management, evidence-based practice resources, and peer support. Providers and their patients will be randomly assigned to intervention groups, which receive the telehealth- enhanced palliative care symptom-management intervention, or to control groups. Our primary aim is to compare patient self-reports of symptoms and quality of life in the intervention and control groups over 2 months. Aim 2 is to examine, in the intervention and control groups over 2 months, providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding symptoms and perceived competence in treating symptoms. Aim 3 is to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. We will use mixed effects models with patients nested within providers to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes. Findings from this study will be instrumental in advancing telehealth and improving symptom management and palliative care among underserved rural populations. Rural patients face many health disparities, including challenges in obtaining palliative care for relief of pain and other distressing symptoms. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a telehealth-enhanced palliative care symptom-management intervention for rural cancer patients and their health care providers. The findings of this study will be instrumental in enhancing symptom management and palliative care, which will have applicability to delivery of other specialist care among underserved rural populations.",Palliative Care Symptom Management in Rural Communities,8894089,R01NR012450,"['Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Constipation ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Financial cost ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Methods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' human population density ', ' Population Density ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Solutions ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Case Management ', ' Competence ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Distant ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' care delivery ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' medical specialist ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' palliative ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Symptoms ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' symptom management ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' case-based ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,424069,-0.005583833079276646

"Standard versus Culturally-Modified ADHD Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorders in children, affecting approximately 5% of youth (APA, 2013). The long-term, developmental trajectory of ADHD suggests that these children continue to experience debilitating symptoms, as well as significant academic, social, and family difficulties into adulthood (Biederman et al., 2012). Given the impact of functional impairment associated with ADHD on the individual and society, it is imperative that effective treatment for ADHD be made available to as many affected youth as possible. In light of staggering mental health disparities for some of the fast growing ethnic minority groups in the United States, such as Latinos, it is particularly important to ensure effective treatment is available to these children who have not been well represented in treatment outcome studies examining parent management training for ADHD or other externalizing disorders (Flores & TCOPR, 2010; Miranda et al., 2005; U.S. Census Bureau, 2008).Thus, consistent with the goals of an R21, the current pilot study aims to close the existing gap in our knowledge about effective psychosocial treatments for Latino families by providing preliminary data regarding the acceptability and efficacy of a culturally-modified treatment and possible moderators that will support a future R01. Specifically, the current pilot study is the first step in a larger program of research aimed at definitively determining if culturally-modified treatment outperforms standard treatment when examining engagement and acceptability outcomes, as well as symptomatology and parental functioning, and if so, which treatment modifications are necessary and for whom. Participants will be 60 Latino children with ADHD and their parents. Families will receive either standard evidence-based treatment or culturally-modified treatment. The following aims will be explored: 1) does culturally-modified treatment result in better engagement and acceptability outcomes (i.e., parental attendance, retention, engagement, and satisfaction) than standard treatment and what is the strength of these effects, 2) does culturally-modified treatment result in improvements in ADHD symptomatology, as well as parental functioning (i.e., parenting stress and efficacy), does the modified treatment result in similar or greater improvements than standard treatment, and what is the strength of these effects, and 3) what possible moderators (i.e., socioeconomic status and behavioral and cognitive acculturation) may explain the relationship between treatment type (i.e., standard versus culturally-modified) and outcomes and what is the strength of these interactions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current pilot study aims to provide preliminary data regarding the acceptability and efficacy of a culturally- modified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) treatment relative to standard treatment for Latino families. Results will impact public health by 1) addressing the mental health disparities that exist for the rapidly growing Latino population in this country (Flores & TCOPR, 2010; U.S. Census Bureau, 2008) and 2) targeting one of the most common mental health disorders in childhood that results in debilitating symptoms lasting into adulthood (APA, 2013; Biederman et al., 2012).",Standard versus Culturally-Modified ADHD Treatment,8928241,R21HD078553,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Authoritarianism ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Positive Reinforcements ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Token Reinforcement ', ' Token Economy ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,179822,-0.022241018955795423

"Effects of Social Context, Culture and Minority Status on Depression and Anxiety DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project investigates the social mechanisms behind ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence of major depression disorder (MDD) and depressive and anxiety symptoms (DAS) in Latino young adults (ages 17-25). We propose to extend the path-breaking Boricua study to examine if experiences of minority status and acculturation are causally linked to differences in prevalence of MDD/DAS across Island versus mainland Puerto Ricans. Since Puerto Ricans are a minority in the South Bronx in NY but a majority on the Island of Puerto Rico, this migrant study design enables us to use variation across sites as a way to examine the causal mechanism of minority status and acculturation on mental health outcomes. Our planned study also includes a wide range of environmental, social, family, and individual level measures associated with MDD and DAS, and uses advanced statistical techniques to identify the risks and protective factors for these negative outcomes. We propose to conduct follow-up interviews with parents and with young adults now ages 17-25 who participated in the Boricua study. Using these data, we will conduct quantitative analysis to: 1) determine the causal impact of minority status as contrasted to majority status, 2) identify the mechanisms behind the effect of minority status on subsequent MDD and DAS, and 3) test conditions that moderate the causal link between minority status and environmental and social context. We will supplement the quantitative analysis with in- depth qualitative interviews and ethnographic neighborhood observation to deepen our understanding of the quantitative findings and identify minority status experiences and acculturation stresses potentially related to changes in MDD and DAS, as well as functional impairment. At the close of our study we intend to create a public-use database of the four waves of Boricua study. This would be the first longitudinal study to assess the causal effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young adult mental illness. Our ultimate goal is to generate information to reduce mental illness in minority communities. The proposed longitudinal project is the first to investigate the long-term effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young-adult mental illness. It holds much promise for understanding the individual, family and neighborhood-level factors to target for interventions to prevent the onset of major depression disorder and anxiety and depressive symptoms in minority youth and young adults.","Effects of Social Context, Culture and Minority Status on Depression and Anxiety",8848135,R01MH098374,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asian Americans ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Island ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Site ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' mental development ', ' Participant ', ' Community based prevention ', ' member ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Stratification ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' critical period ', ' early adolescence ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIMH,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,R01,2015,744019,-0.009434933738753568
"Center for Adaptive Leadership in Symptom Science     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Center of Excellence (P30) will promote biobehavioral research to extend symptom science using the Adaptive Leadership (AL) framework to conceptualize and study cognitive/affective symptoms in chronic illness. The overall Center aims are to:    (1) Enhance and sustain the productivity of new nursing scientists engaged in interdisciplinary  biobehavioral research to understand and ameliorate symptoms, symptom distress, and symptom  sequelae using adaptive approaches for people with cognitive/affective changes in chronic illness;  (2) Assist investigators to tailor research approaches and interventions to optimize research  participation by people with cognitive/affective changes by addressing minority health issues and  refining existing, or creating new intervention protocols and self-report measures (i.e.,  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS].  (3) Increase investigator competence in using longitudinal quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches to examine the trajectories of symptoms, symptom sequelae and patient adaptation associated with cognitive/affective changes.    The work of the Center will be carried by in three Cores, the Administrative Core, the Mentoring and Scholarship Core, and the Design and Methods Core. Expected outcomes of the center include  studies of trajectories of cognitive/affective symptoms and symptom sequelae to describe patterns,  variability, and change over time to gain knowledge needed about critical periods or transition points  for timing of interventions, identify differences within subpopulatios such as those with varying levels  of cognitive ability or minority health needs, and generate knowledge for developing/testing  interventions to enhance patients' adaptive capabilities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Barriers to care arise for people with cognitive/affective changes because they may not clearly convey concerns or communicate easily.

"Lifecourse cardiovascular risk, depression and cognition in black & white adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive function and depressive symptoms share many cardiovascular origins and their prevalence increases dramatically with age. Emerging evidence suggests that the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes progresses over the life course and may be different in older adults compared to middle-aged and younger adults. Racial disparities in cardiovascular risk factors and the age at which they develop may further exacerbate these associations. This 5-year K01 award application seeks to improve our knowledge of the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive function and depressive symptoms over the life course in black and white adults. Additionally, this proposal will elucidate the role of cardiovascular risk factors with underlying structural brain changes over the life course. This proposal involves analyses of two large biracial epidemiologic cohorts: including 1) the ongoing CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study of 5,115 young adult to middle-aged men and women (52% blacks and 48% whites), and 2) the ongoing Health ABC (Health, Aging and Body Composition) study of 3,075 older adult men and women (42% blacks and 58% whites). We hypothesize that greater exposure to non-optimal cardiovascular measures will be associated with worse cognitive function, greater number of depressive symptoms, and worse structural brain indices such as greater white matter lesions and hippocampal atrophy across the life course in blacks and whites. The data structure of the cohorts will enable us to evaluate several life course epidemiologic models such as early vs. late life cardiovascular exposure, with the possibility of evaluating sensitive periods. This life course approach is mirrored in the scientifi aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, we will determine how young adulthood and midlife cardiovascular exposure (CARDIA) and late life cardiovascular exposure (Health ABC) influence trajectories of depressive symptoms. In Aims 2 and 3, we will determine how young adulthood cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive performance and structural brain integrity at midlife (CARDIA) and how late life cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive decline and structural brain integrity in late life (Health ABC). The proposed analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan that will (1) advance my conceptual training in the clinical aspect of cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular aspects in particular; (2) train me in neuroimaging and markers of structural brain integrity; and (3) advance my methodologic training in longitudinal and neuroimaging related statistical methods and my knowledge of life course models.

"Fostering Supported Education and Employment in First Episode Psychosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All young persons are faced with the decision of how to invest in their human capital development; this normative tension is particularly pronounced for young persons who have experienced a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Interruptions in their education and employment following FEP can lead not only to poor socioeconomic outcomes, but also impair psychiatric recovery. FEP treatment programs have demonstrated effectiveness in improving outcomes and reducing the probability of disability for newly-diagnosed young persons with schizophrenia and related disorders. FEP programs have indicated a need for knowledge to help clients navigate the developmental milestone of choosing investments in school and work. Training Plan: This K01 Award will train the candidate to become an independent investigator conducting policy analysis to improve psychiatric and socioeconomic outcomes for persons with psychiatric disorders. This K01 will provide training in 1) clinical and policy elements of FEP treatment and 2) SEE services, 3) the impact of racial/ethnic disparities on SEE access and engagement, and 4) methodological training in mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods data collection and analysis. These skills, combined with my quantitative analysis training and commitment to promoting socioeconomic recovery of individuals with psychiatric disorders, will give me the tools I need to launch an independent research career. Research Plan: This study will develop policy recommendations to help policymakers and program leaders identify how best to provide SEE services to clients with FEP, to enable clients to make a meaningful choice of SEE services. The Specific Aims are: 1) To identify predictors of human capital attainment in a population-based survey among persons who report symptoms of psychosis, prior to the availability of comprehensive FEP programs; 2) To identify predictors, barriers, and challenges to the use of SEE services in FEP treatment programs; and 3) To examine SEE and FEP service utilization patterns over the duration of FEP treatment. Methodology: The mentored research project will encompass secondary data analyses from a nationally-representative sample of US adults (the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys), from the Improving Work Outcomes study at the University of California Los Angeles, and from the New York State initiative, OnTrackNY. Primary data will be collected from semi-structured interviews with program staff at existing FEP programs, and staff and clients at the New York State OnTrackNY initiative. A meta-analysis will be conducted with data from OnTrackNY and the Recovering After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Connection. At the conclusion of the K01, the findings will be reviewed by OnTrackNY leadership, to lay out a series of policy options that can help to improve SEE service delivery and utilization. The policy environment is ripe for identifying models that can lead to long-term improvements in psychiatric functioning and reduce disability, and could be expanded to young adults with other psychiatric disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses Objective 3, Strategy 3.4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan: Identify and systematically study elements of personalized mental health care. The results from this K01 will help FEP programs personalize their provision of supported education and/or employment services, to allow them to adapt to the needs and circumstances of individuals they are designed to help.",Fostering Supported Education and Employment in First Episode Psychosis,8932025,K01MH103445,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' California ', ' Client ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' supportive employment ', ' Supported Employment ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' tool ', ' Mandatory Reporting ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' human capital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' service utilization ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population based ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' policy implication ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2015,185464,0.024543318443121673
"Tech-Based Depression and Anxiety Treatment for Youth in High Risk Environments The PI¿s career goal is to become an independent investigator developing and evaluating novel interventions for underserved, vulnerable youth with anxiety and depressive disorders. This proposal outlines a plan to achieve this goal, through culmination of the training and research plans into an extremely competitive R01 proposal. The training plan takes full advantage of the candidate¿s strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University¿s Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as relations with the broader community of researchers working with youth in high risk social environments. Training will include multidisciplinary mentorship, coursework, conferences, seminars, systematic professional interactions, readings, collaboration with a youth advisory board, and a mentored publication plan. Training goals necessary to the PI¿s career goal involve growth in: 1) intervention development and evaluation; 2) adolescent psychology; 3) cultural issues pertinent to vulnerable youth; and 4) general career development. This plan builds on the PI¿s background in clinical psychology, which has focused on technology- based treatments for depression and anxiety, contextual models of mental health disparities, implications of co- occurring psychiatric disorders on treatment outcomes, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In this K08, the PI will extend her work to include youth, increasing the impact of her research through earlier intervention. The long-term goal of the research is to open a new avenue to culturally competent care by: 1) applying treatment principles efficacious in general populations to unique concerns of underserved youth facing multiple risks to their physical and mental health; 2) developing a mobile treatment that provides real-time, context- specific intervention; and 3) extending population-level care, via Internet and mobile phone technologies, to youth unable to access existing services. To this end, the research plan will: 1) identify context-specific risk factors for anxiety and depressive symptoms in vulnerable youth; 2) identify treatment targets accordingly; and 3) develop an engaging, accessible intervention tailored to vulnerable adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The intervention, delivered via an advanced mobile phone application, the Internet, and brief telephone support, will be grounded in validated CBT techniques and more recent advances in transdiagnostic CBT. Research aims will be achieved via: 1) Study 1, analysis of an existing longitudinal, epidemiological dataset to identify context-specific social stressors that predict increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and cognitive mechanisms by which the social stressors impact anxiety and depression; 2) Study 2, development, usability testing, and a subsequent feasibility trial of a new, transdiagnostic Internet and mobile phone intervention teaching CBT skills to vulnerable adolescents with MDD and GAD, and applying these skills to targets identified from Study 1; and 3) Study 3, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the intervention to an attention control. Studies 2 and 3 will provide preliminary data for an R01 proposing a larger RCT. The proposed research will identity group-specific intervention targets to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in vulnerable youth, through analysis of an existing longitudinal study in a sample of youth in high risk social environments. Findings will be translated to develop and conduct early testing of an intervention designed to decrease symptoms in vulnerable youth with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, using Internet and mobile phone formats that are widely accessible, cost-effective, scalable, private, and familiar to youth.",Tech-Based Depression and Anxiety Treatment for Youth in High Risk

"Center for Adaptive Leadership in Symptom Science DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Center of Excellence (P30) will promote biobehavioral research to extend symptom science using the Adaptive Leadership (AL) framework to conceptualize and study cognitive/affective symptoms in chronic illness. The overall Center aims are to:    (1) Enhance and sustain the productivity of new nursing scientists engaged in interdisciplinary  biobehavioral research to understand and ameliorate symptoms, symptom distress, and symptom  sequelae using adaptive approaches for people with cognitive/affective changes in chronic illness;  (2) Assist investigators to tailor research approaches and interventions to optimize research  participation by people with cognitive/affective changes by addressing minority health issues and  refining existing, or creating new intervention protocols and self-report measures (i.e.,  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS].  (3) Increase investigator competence in using longitudinal quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches to examine the trajectories of symptoms, symptom sequelae and patient adaptation associated with cognitive/affective changes.    The work of the Center will be carried by in three Cores, the Administrative Core, the Mentoring and Scholarship Core, and the Design and Methods Core. Expected outcomes of the center include  studies of trajectories of cognitive/affective symptoms and symptom sequelae to describe patterns,  variability, and change over time to gain knowledge needed about critical periods or transition points  for timing of interventions, identify differences within subpopulatios such as those with varying levels  of cognitive ability or minority health needs, and generate knowledge for developing/testing  interventions to enhance patients' adaptive capabilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Barriers to care arise for people with cognitive/affective changes because they may not clearly convey concerns or communicate easily. If not addressed through research, these barriers will create health disparities. Center researchers will study trajectories of cognitive/affective symptoms and symptom sequelae to gain knowledge needed for developing tailored interventions and enhance care for these populations.",Center for Adaptive Leadership in Symptom Science,9145868,P30NR014139,"['Affective Symptoms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Health ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Scholarship ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Caring ', ' Distress ', ' Measurement ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Cognitive ', ' minority health ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' critical period ', ' ']",NINR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,P30,2015,164085,0.12398239518433891
"Lifecourse cardiovascular risk, depression and cognition in black & white adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive function and depressive symptoms share many cardiovascular origins and their prevalence increases dramatically with age. Emerging evidence suggests that the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes progresses over the life course and may be different in older adults compared to middle-aged and younger adults. Racial disparities in cardiovascular risk factors and the age at which they develop may further exacerbate these associations. This 5-year K01 award application seeks to improve our knowledge of the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive function and depressive symptoms over the life course in black and white adults. Additionally, this proposal will elucidate the role of cardiovascular risk factors with underlying structural brain changes over the life course. This proposal involves analyses of two large biracial epidemiologic cohorts: including 1) the ongoing CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study of 5,115 young adult to middle-aged men and women (52% blacks and 48% whites), and 2) the ongoing Health ABC (Health, Aging and Body Composition) study of 3,075 older adult men and women (42% blacks and 58% whites). We hypothesize that greater exposure to non-optimal cardiovascular measures will be associated with worse cognitive function, greater number of depressive symptoms, and worse structural brain indices such as greater white matter lesions and hippocampal atrophy across the life course in blacks and whites. The data structure of the cohorts will enable us to evaluate several life course epidemiologic models such as early vs. late life cardiovascular exposure, with the possibility of evaluating sensitive periods. This life course approach is mirrored in the scientifi aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, we will determine how young adulthood and midlife cardiovascular exposure (CARDIA) and late life cardiovascular exposure (Health ABC) influence trajectories of depressive symptoms. In Aims 2 and 3, we will determine how young adulthood cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive performance and structural brain integrity at midlife (CARDIA) and how late life cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive decline and structural brain integrity in late life (Health ABC). The proposed analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan that will (1) advance my conceptual training in the clinical aspect of cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular aspects in particular; (2) train me in neuroimaging and markers of structural brain integrity; and (3) advance my methodologic training in longitudinal and neuroimaging related statistical methods and my knowledge of life course models. My training plan will include formal courses, clinical assessment and grand rounds, attendance at scholarly seminars, directed readings and professional development activities specifically tailored to my training goals.

"Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan, from development through aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female- specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each of the two Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interests. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either their known higher incidence and/or differential expression in women than men and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we believe that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education, training, and development of junior investigators who will commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-dependent treatment approaches and public awareness of the importance of these sex-dependent health issues for families and society.",Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside,9146370,K12HD051959,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Biology ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Genes ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Israel ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Puberty ', ' Reading ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Training Programs ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Endocrine ', ' interest ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' translational approach ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2016,378000,0.07466664792192776
"Sex differences in amygdala function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite a higher incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in females, and sex differences in the expression of symptoms, the neurobiological underpinnings of sex differences in affective behaviors are not well understood. Dysfunction of the amygdala contributes to these disorders, yet it is unknown whether there are sex differences in amygdala neuronal function, or in amygdala susceptibility in psychopathology. Targeting of sex differences in amygdala pathology is expected to provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of affective disorders. The objective of this project is to test whether differences exist in amygdala physiology and function in females and males, and whether a stress model that shares features with mood disorders exerts sex-dependent effects on the amygdala. This project will test the central hypothesis that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in females is more responsive than the BLA in males, that this difference is specific for subcircuits of BLA neurons, and that stress decreases neuronal excitability and function of the BLA in females, but exerts opposite effects on BLA function in males. This project will test the contribution of ion channels that regulate BLA neuronal excitability to the sex differences, and key enzymes that modulate the function of these ion channels. In addition, this project will also test whether pharmacologica manipulation of these novel ion channel and enzymatic targets reverses the behavioral impact of stress. The rationale for these studies is that the mechanism for sex differences in amygdala-dependent behaviors and the impact of stress on these behaviors is not known. These issues need to be understood to determine the role of the amygdala in sex differences in mood disorder symptomology. The Aims of this proposal are to test if sex differences in BLA neuronal excitability is specific for BLA subcircuits, if the effects of repeated stress on BLA function are sex dependent, and if the effects can be reversed in a sex-dependent manner. This will be tested using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological approaches, combined with biochemical and behavioral approaches. These Aims are expected to demonstrate sex differences in the physiology of the BLA, the effects of repeated stress on BLA physiology and function, and that pharmacological targeting of the effects of stress will reverse impairments in a sex-dependent manner. This can lead to novel insight into the cause of sex differences in mood and anxiety disorders, and lead to a novel sex-dependent therapeutic approach for rapid treatment of mood disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project is important for public health because of the need to understand the causes of psychiatric disorders, and to reduce sex disparities in mental health. Women have a higher prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders than men and display differences in symptomology. Compounded on this, current antidepressant medications may take months to reach clinical efficacy. The research proposed here can lead to novel insight into the cause of sex differences in mood disorders, and lead to a novel sex-dependent therapeutic approach for rapid treatment of mood disorders.",Sex differences in amygdala function,8960949,R01MH100536,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' protein blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Metestrus ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Pathology ', ' Physiology ', ' Proestrus ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Lateral ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Estrous Cycle ', ' protein expression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' High Prevalence ', ' in vivo ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' human female ', ' restraint stress ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' balance testing ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' ']",NIMH,ROSALIND FRANKLIN UNIV OF MEDICINE & SCI,R01,2016,386250,-0.007416228225926346
"Center for Adaptive Leadership in Symptom Science     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Center of Excellence (P30) will promote biobehavioral research to extend symptom science using the Adaptive Leadership (AL) framework to conceptualize and study cognitive/affective symptoms in chronic illness. The overall Center aims are to:    (1) Enhance and sustain the productivity of new nursing scientists engaged in interdisciplinary  biobehavioral research to understand and ameliorate symptoms, symptom distress, and symptom  sequelae using adaptive approaches for people with cognitive/affective changes in chronic illness;  (2) Assist investigators to tailor research approaches and interventions to optimize research  participation by people with cognitive/affective changes by addressing minority health issues and  refining existing, or creating new intervention protocols and self-report measures (i.e.,  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS].  (3) Increase investigator competence in using longitudinal quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches to examine the trajectories of symptoms, symptom sequelae and patient adaptation associated with cognitive/affective changes.    The work of the Center will be carried by in three Cores, the Administrative Core, the Mentoring and Scholarship Core, and the Design and Methods Core. Expected outcomes of the center include  studies of trajectories of cognitive/affective symptoms and symptom sequelae to describe patterns,  variability, and change over time to gain knowledge needed about critical periods or transition points  for timing of interventions, identify differences within subpopulatios such as those with varying levels  of cognitive ability or minority health needs, and generate knowledge for developing/testing  interventions to enhance patients' adaptive capabilities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Barriers to care arise for people with cognitive/affective changes because they may not clearly convey concerns or communicate easily.

"Partnership to Develop and Pilot-Test a Peer Program to Reduce Depressive Symptoms in Men with Physical Disabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Previously we developed, tested and disseminated a highly effective peer counseling program to reduce depressive symptoms in women with physical disabilities in partnership with Oregon Centers for Independent Living (CILs). Our academic-disability community partnership created Healing Pathways using community- based participatory research methods and we have sustained our partnership over 9 years. Healing Pathways is currently publicly funded and offered by four of the seven CILs in Oregon. The success of Healing Pathways is a direct result of community investment in and ownership of the program. We propose replicating this model to address depression in men with physical disabilities (MPDs). Depression is a common secondary condition in MPDs, occurring at rates between 37-64%. This is 2-3 times the rate of depression found in non-disabled men. MPDs with depression are at greater risk for decreased physical functioning, unemployment, social isolation, decreased life satisfaction, institutionalization, and death compared to men in the general population. To build on the success of Healing Pathways and to begin to address the serious problem of depressive symptoms in MPDs our academic disability community partnership proposes a community-engaged, exploratory sequential, mixed methods study to achieve the following three specific aims 1) Adapt the Healing Pathways program to meet the needs of MPDs with depressive symptoms; 2) Conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the peer program; and 3) Estimate the effect size of the peer program for depressive symptoms. The long-term goal of this program of research is to improve mental health outcomes in people with physical disabilities by partnering with members of this community. The outcomes of the proposed study will collectively inform the development of a future randomized controlled trial of the peer program designed to treat depressive symptoms in MPDs. The proposed study addresses several public health goals including Healthy People 2020 goal DH18 to reduce the proportion of people with disabilities who report serious emotional distress, and the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health goals 1-3, to understand that mental health is essential to overall health, promote mental health treatments that are consumer-driven, and eliminate disparities in mental health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will contribute to the development of an evidence-based peer group counseling program that addresses depressive symptoms in men with physical disabilities. Expanding treatment options for depressive symptoms in men with physical disabilities will improve their access to care.

"A Stepped-Care Telehealth Approach to Treat Distress in Rural Cancer Survivors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychosocial distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, is common in post-treatment cancer survivors and associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including sleep disturbance, fatigue and decreased quality of life (QOL). Interventions that are accessible to post-treatment cancer survivors experiencing significant distress are sorely needed, especially in rural areas where psychosocial care is scarce. Recent national guidelines recommend screening all adults with cancer for distress and treating those with moderate to severe symptoms using a stepped-care approach. The purpose of this pilot study is to implement a stepped- care approach in rural community oncology settings using a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol that includes both self-directed and telehealth approaches. Specific aims are to: (1) determine feasibility (accrual, retention, adherence) of a randomized controlled trial of a stepped-care mental health intervention (tailored to symptom level) versus enhanced usual care (EUC) in 90 rural, post-treatment cancer survivors with moderate to severe levels of distress (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms); (2) obtain preliminary efficacy data for reducing emotional distress and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, fear of recurrence, QOL); and (3) determine intervention costs. We will recruit 90 adult (age ≥18), rural cancer survivors who are 6-24 months post-treatment for female breast, colorectal, prostate, or gynecologic cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and who report clinically significant anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants will be stratified by symptom severity and randomized to stepped-care or EUC. For participants with moderate symptoms, low- intensity, stepped care will consist of a self-guided CBT workbook and biweekly check-in calls to assess changes in symptom severity/immediate need for psychiatric treatment and to provide minimal support. For participants with moderate to severe symptoms, high-intensity stepped care will consist of a CBT workbook and psychotherapy delivered by telephone. Participants randomized to EUC will receive survivorship resources and referral information for local mental health providers. Measures will be administered by telephone and mail at pre-, mid- and post-intervention. The proposed study efficiently builds on prior and current research and leverages the existing NCI-funded Research Base infrastructure. The innovation of this work is its focus on addressing a mental health disparity among rural cancer survivors through a stepped-care intervention. After this study is completed, we will implement a fully-powered study in the community cancer setting. The resultant intervention will have great potential for widespread dissemination since it will be manualized, delivered by telephone, and comprised of modules to allow customized treatments for individuals with different cancer types.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental health issues in post-treatment adult cancer survivors are associated with multiple adverse outcomes and may represent a cancer health disparity for rural survivors. The purpose of this study is to test a stepped- care approach tailored to symptom severity based on recent American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for reducing emotional distress (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms) and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, fear of recurrence, quality of life) in rural, post-treatment cancer survivors in community oncology settings and to examine intervention costs. The resultant intervention will have great potential for widespread dissemination since it will be manualized, delivered by telephone, and comprised of modules to allow customized treatments for

"Steroid Hormone Regulation of Anxiety-Related Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the most prevalent of mental afflictions, anxiety disorders are more commonly diagnosed in women than in men. There is ample evidence that circulating levels of gonadal steroid hormones, including estrogens such as estradiol and androgens such as testosterone, can reduce anxiety in humans and so may play a role in the sex difference in anxiety disorders. Laboratory mice also show a sex difference in anxiety- like behaviors that, as with anxiety in humans, are reduced by circulating testosterone. In mice, it is clear that circulating levels of steroids modulate anxiety-like behaviors. We want t perform exploratory experiments to determine which brain regions are being affected by hormones to reduce anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Preliminary observations suggest that two plausible brain sites for modulating anxiety, the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, are not the sites responding to testosterone. Other observations implicate the basolateral amygdala as a potential site of hormone action and we would like to conduct experiments to confirm or refute these indications. Understanding how gonadal hormones act on the brain to reduce anxiety in mice may suggest new therapeutic approaches for anxiety disorder in humans.

"Accelerating the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in rural Idaho via evidence-based Smartphone technology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A disparity exists between rural and urban/suburban children with suspected ASD in the time interval between first identification of a possible problem and a firm diagnosis. This project will investigate the effect of a recently developed and validated remote diagnostic method leveraging an evidence - based Smartphone Telehealth service called NODA(tm) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on reducing the time between the age of first parent concern and the age at first diagnosis from a qualified professional. The reduction of this time interval is critical to allow families to fully benefit from an early intensve behavioral intervention (EIBI) program. This application of technology can be particularly advantageous for families who live in rural regions throughout the United States because they may face additional barriers to obtaining an accurate diagnosis, which is necessary before commencing appropriate treatment services.

"Targeting School Climate and Children's Behavioral Health in Urban Schools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unmet need for mental health services is extraordinarily high among urban children of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. As overall need continues to rise, schools are fast becoming the main source of mental health services for children. Externalizing behavior disorders and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in low-income urban children. Unfortunately, evidence-based interventions (EBI) for those disorders are seldom employed in urban schools. School-Wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS), a multi-level services delivery strategy that combines universal and targeted interventions, has been found to be effective in improving school climate, perceived school safety, and student reading scores. Targeted group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) can be provided to at-risk and high-risk students as part of the SWPBS system. Unfortunately, SWPBS and GCBT are seldom employed in under-resourced urban schools, in part, because school districts do not have enough resources to contract outside providers with expertise in EBIs for behavioral health problems. Also, widespread deployment of EBIs to ""real world"" settings has been hampered by problems such as inadequate training of service providers and poor implementation fidelity. The creation of mechanisms for the training and support of counselors and other school personnel that focus on maintaining high implementation fidelity and integrity can facilitate a significant increase in the use of EBIs in urban schools and contribute to lowering behavioral health disparities.  The overall purpose of this project is to determine whether school personnel implementing a two-tier SWPBS program for typically developing children and children with, or at risk for, externalizing or anxiety disorders, can implement the components of the program with the same level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness when they receive a Low Level of Support (LLS) from their coaches and supervisors as compared to a High Level of Support (HLS). We also want to determine whether school personnel who receive HLS for two years could continue to implement the components of the program with a similar level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness while receiving LLS during the following two years. We will calculate the total costs and net costs associated with the development and implementation of the SWPBS program. The study uses a cohort-sequential design and follows 6 separate K-8 schools in the Philadelphia School District, yielding approximately 48 leadership team members, 180 school personnel, and 3,900 students in Tier 1, and 12 counselors, 84 groups of 4-5 children with, or at risk for, oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder in each CBT group, and 3-4 children with, or at risk for, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, o social phobia in each CBT group, for a total of 306 evaluable child participants. Schools will be randomly assigned to receive either HLS or LLS from project staff. The proposed study is consistent with the current strategic plan of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), particularly the commitment to support research that addresses barriers to school readiness and academic success for minority and low-income children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Demonstrating that school personnel can implement evidence-based interventions (EBI) for externalizing and anxiety problems with a high degree of fidelity, integrity and clinical effectiveness under varying levels of support could spur more initiatives toward the adoption of EBIs in urban schools, thus further lowering health disparities in these settings.",Targeting School Climate and Children's Behavioral Health in Urban Schools,8976782,R01HD073430,"['Adoption ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mission ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Perception ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Social Phobia ', ' Productivity ', ' Program Development ', ' Reading ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' School-Based Services ', ' School Health Services ', ' Schools ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Students ', ' Supervision ', ' Training Support ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Latino ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Secondary to ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' Discipline ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Emotional ', ' behavioral health ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Separation Anxiety Disorder ', ' Improve Access ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Evaluable ', ' Evaluable Disease ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' school district ', ' academic preparation ', ' academic readiness ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2016,603859,0.035589565957809065
"mHealth for Heart Failure Symptom Monitoring ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding better ways to engage patients with heart failure (HF) in symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers. Symptoms are the main driver of health- related outcomes for patients with HF and the primary driver of repeated hospital readmissions. Given that we are located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, a predominantly poor Latino community, we are uniquely positioned to address the health disparity in clinical outcomes for Latino patients with HF as well as others with HF using a mobile health (mHealth) application (app). The proposed long-term goal of this NIH K99/R00 application is to assist the candidate, Dr. Masterson Creber, in becoming an independent investigator with a program of research focusing on high quality, technology-based behavioral health interventions to improve outcomes and support patient-centered cardiovascular care for underserved patients with HF. The overall objective of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that a novel app, mi.Symptoms can meaningfully alter patient-reported and clinical outcomes of patients with HF and lead to more successful symptom recognition, response and communication with healthcare providers. The central hypothesis is that empowering patients to take more control of their symptom experience using a technology-enabled point-of-care symptom reporting intervention (mi.Symptoms) can meaningfully alter symptom response behaviors the clinical outcomes of patients with HF. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in the K99 phase of the study by pursing the following specific aims: 1) test the reliability and validity of mi.Symptoms (a novel mHealth app developed by Dr. Masterson Creber and a team from Columbia University School of Engineering), and 2) assess the usability of mi.Symptoms and examine relationships of its use with changes in patient-reported outcomes in a pilot feasibility study. In the R00 phase of the study, the specific aim is to: 3) examine the efficacy o mi.Symptoms on improving patient-reported and clinical outcomes as compared to usual care. The training plan for this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will enable Dr. Masterson Creber to couple skills in biomedical informatics with clinical trial design and outcomes research. The approach has three innovative features: 1) it is grounded in the Theory of Situation Awareness in Dynamic Systems; 2) there is a close link between the theoretical model and unique functional elements of the mi.Symptoms web app (tailoring to patient preference by choosing an avatar, prompting to report symptoms, reinforcing symptom reporting with hedonic motivation, and decreasing barriers to facilitate communication with providers); and 3) it applies growth modeling to the analysis of multiple symptoms and outcomes over time. Findings from this study will provide insights into the development and testing of mi.Symptoms as well as many other mHealth apps. The research is significant because it addresses the important problem of patients with HF struggling to recognize and respond to their symptoms, and it addresses the health disparity in HF outcomes for Latino patients. To accomplish the aims of this proposed study, a robust mentorship team with internationally and nationally recognized experts has been built, including expertise in biomedical informatics with a focus on mHealth (Dr. Suzanne Bakken), cardiovascular behavioral health and clinical trial design (Dr. Karina Davidson), user-centered design (Dr. Steven Feiner), clinical heart failure management (Dr. Mathew Maurer), symptom monitoring (Dr. Kathleen Hickey), quantitative methodologies (Dr. Christopher Lee), and mHealth application development and testing (Dr. Cornelia Ruland). Since a spectrum of new knowledge and skills regarding biomedical informatics, computer science and user-interfaces, and behavioral health clinical trial design are required for the candidate's career as an independent scientist, this K99/R00 award will be extremely important and necessary to achieve the candidate's career objectives and expand symptom science and the science of self- management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because providing patients with heart failure with an accessible mobile Health application to support symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers may improve patient-reported and clinical outcomes for heart failure and reduce health disparities among Latinos. The proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINR's mission that pertains to improving symptom science and self-management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases.        ",mHealth for

"Effects of Social Context, Culture and Minority Status on Depression and Anxiety DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project investigates the social mechanisms behind ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence of major depression disorder (MDD) and depressive and anxiety symptoms (DAS) in Latino young adults (ages 17-25). We propose to extend the path-breaking Boricua study to examine if experiences of minority status and acculturation are causally linked to differences in prevalence of MDD/DAS across Island versus mainland Puerto Ricans. Since Puerto Ricans are a minority in the South Bronx in NY but a majority on the Island of Puerto Rico, this migrant study design enables us to use variation across sites as a way to examine the causal mechanism of minority status and acculturation on mental health outcomes. Our planned study also includes a wide range of environmental, social, family, and individual level measures associated with MDD and DAS, and uses advanced statistical techniques to identify the risks and protective factors for these negative outcomes. We propose to conduct follow-up interviews with parents and with young adults now ages 17-25 who participated in the Boricua study. Using these data, we will conduct quantitative analysis to: 1) determine the causal impact of minority status as contrasted to majority status, 2) identify the mechanisms behind the effect of minority status on subsequent MDD and DAS, and 3) test conditions that moderate the causal link between minority status and environmental and social context. We will supplement the quantitative analysis with in- depth qualitative interviews and ethnographic neighborhood observation to deepen our understanding of the quantitative findings and identify minority status experiences and acculturation stresses potentially related to changes in MDD and DAS, as well as functional impairment. At the close of our study we intend to create a public-use database of the four waves of Boricua study. This would be the first longitudinal study to assess the causal effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young adult mental illness. Our ultimate goal is to generate information to reduce mental illness in minority communities. The proposed longitudinal project is the first to investigate the long-term effects of early experiences of minority status and acculturation on Latino young-adult mental illness. It holds much promise for understanding the individual, family and neighborhood-level factors to target for interventions to prevent the onset of major depression disorder and anxiety and depressive symptoms in minority youth and young adults.","Effects of Social Context, Culture and Minority Status on Depression and Anxiety",9172200,R01MH098374,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asian Americans ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Island ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Site ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' mental development ', ' Participant ', ' Community based prevention ', ' member ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Stratification ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' critical period ', ' early adolescence ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' population health ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,716330,-0.009434933738753568
"Tech-Based Depression and Anxiety Treatment for Youth in High Risk Environments The PI¿s career goal is to become an independent investigator developing and evaluating novel interventions for underserved, vulnerable youth with anxiety and depressive disorders. This proposal outlines a plan to achieve this goal, through culmination of the training and research plans into an extremely competitive R01 proposal. The training plan takes full advantage of the candidate¿s strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University¿s Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as relations with the broader community of researchers working with youth in high risk social environments. Training will include multidisciplinary mentorship, coursework, conferences, seminars, systematic professional interactions, readings, collaboration with a youth advisory board, and a mentored publication plan. Training goals necessary to the PI¿s career goal involve growth in: 1) intervention development and evaluation; 2) adolescent psychology; 3) cultural issues pertinent to vulnerable youth; and 4) general career development. This plan builds on the PI¿s background in clinical psychology, which has focused on technology- based treatments for depression and anxiety, contextual models of mental health disparities, implications of co- occurring psychiatric disorders on treatment outcomes, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In this K08, the PI will extend her work to include youth, increasing the impact of her research through earlier intervention. The long-term goal of the research is to open a new avenue to culturally competent care by: 1) applying treatment principles efficacious in general populations to unique concerns of underserved youth facing multiple risks to their physical and mental health; 2) developing a mobile treatment that provides real-time, context- specific intervention; and 3) extending population-level care, via Internet and mobile phone technologies, to youth unable to access existing services. To this end, the research plan will: 1) identify context-specific risk factors for anxiety and depressive symptoms in vulnerable youth; 2) identify treatment targets accordingly; and 3) develop an engaging, accessible intervention tailored to vulnerable adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The intervention, delivered via an advanced mobile phone application, the Internet, and brief telephone support, will be grounded in validated CBT techniques and more recent advances in transdiagnostic CBT. Research aims will be achieved via: 1) Study 1, analysis of an existing longitudinal, epidemiological dataset to identify context-specific social stressors that predict increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and cognitive mechanisms by which the social stressors impact anxiety and depression; 2) Study 2, development, usability testing, and a subsequent feasibility trial of a new, transdiagnostic Internet and mobile phone intervention teaching CBT skills to vulnerable adolescents with MDD and GAD, and applying these skills to targets identified from Study 1; and 3) Study 3, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the intervention to an attention control. Studies 2 and 3 will provide preliminary data for an R01 proposing a larger RCT. The proposed research will identity group-specific intervention targets to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in vulnerable youth, through analysis of an existing longitudinal study in a sample of youth in high risk social environments. Findings will be translated to develop and conduct early testing of an intervention designed to decrease symptoms in vulnerable youth with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, using Internet and mobile phone formats that are widely accessible, cost-effective, scalable, private, and familiar to youth.",Tech-Based Depression and Anxiety Treatment for Youth in High Risk

"Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly reduces the risk of hospitalizations, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increases quality of life. Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience. Our study will test use of a web-enabled app with tailored feedback that is integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record. This app is designed to improve patient-provider communication about adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits among diverse patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We will evaluate the intervention on a comprehensive set of outcomes, including rigorous measures of long-term adherence, quality of life, and costs.",Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence,9369578,R01CA218155,"['Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' mortality ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tablets ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Time Management ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Adjuvant ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' web-enabled ', ' chemotherapy ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' three-arm study ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2017,444027,0.05086204994587611

"A Brief, Peer Co-Led, Group-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Sexual Minority Young Adult Men Project Summary/Abstract Eating disorders are resistant to treatment and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, efficacious and efficient eating disorder prevention programs are greatly needed. There has been a longstanding belief among the general public, and clinicians, that eating disorders are nearly an exclusively female problem. However, extant literature has found that males also experience eating disorders, constituting up to 40% of individuals with diagnostic/sub-threshold eating pathology. Among males, sexual minorities (i.e., gay, bisexual, and non-heterosexual identified individuals) are a salient subgroup that is at substantial risk for developing eating disorders. Indeed, sexual minority males are not only at elevated risk compared to heterosexual males, but are also at elevated risk compared to heterosexual females. The lifetime prevalence for any eating disorder diagnosis among sexual minority males is 8.8%, and subclinical diagnosis is 15.6%. This is in contrast to heterosexual females, in which the prevalence for clinical and subclinical diagnoses are at 4.8% and 8.0%, respectively. These findings indicate that sexual minority males may well be one of the most vulnerable groups in regard to eating pathology risk. To date, there is a paucity of research on eating disorder prevention programs among sexual minority males. We are only aware of one previous prevention program targeting sexual minority males. This program, the PRIDE Body Project, developed and tested by our research team, is a two-session, peer co-led, group, cognitive dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program, based on existing eating disorder prevention programs developed with females. In our preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT), we found significant and large effects on eating pathology and relevant eating disorder risk factors, compared to a waitlist control condition, at post-treatment and 4-weeks post-treatment. Additionally, preliminary mediation analyses revealed that internalization of the appearance ideal and body dissatisfaction accounted for significant variance in the relationship between treatment condition and eating pathology. These results represent an important first step in demonstrating the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a brief, peer-led eating disorder prevention program for sexual minority males. Despite these initial findings, future research is needed to further test this promising intervention. Specifically, it is not known if the PRIDE Body Project will exert a clinically and statistically significant effect in comparison to a time and attention matched control condition. Additionally, it is unknown if the intervention effects will persist beyond 4-weeks post intervention. With these limitations in mind, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial assessing the PRIDE Body Project to a time and attention-matched active control condition, and follow participants for 24 months. Additionally, we plan to assess potential mediators (body dissatisfaction and internalization of the appearance ideal) of the treatment effect on eating disorder symptoms. Narrative Sexual minority men are one of the most vulnerable groups for developing eating disorders. However, limited data on targeted eating disorder prevention programs exist for this population. Thus, we seek to test the efficacy of a group based, peer co-led, eating disorder prevention program for sexual minority young adult men.","A Brief, Peer Co-Led, Group-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Sexual Minority Young Adult Men",9287726,R01MD012698,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' bulimic ', ' Bulimia Nervosa ', ' Bulimia ', ' Cognitive Dissonance ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Binge eating disorder ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Appearance ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Scheme ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' body dissatisfaction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' treatment effect ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' eating pathology ', ' sexual minority ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' non-heterosexual ', ' ']",NIMHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,684803,0.0009493037847821817
"mHealth for Heart Failure Symptom Monitoring ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding better ways to engage patients with heart failure (HF) in symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers. Symptoms are the main driver of health- related outcomes for patients with HF and the primary driver of repeated hospital readmissions. Given that we are located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, a predominantly poor Latino community, we are uniquely positioned to address the health disparity in clinical outcomes for Latino patients with HF as well as others with HF using a mobile health (mHealth) application (app). The proposed long-term goal of this NIH K99/R00 application is to assist the candidate, Dr. Masterson Creber, in becoming an independent investigator with a program of research focusing on high quality, technology-based behavioral health interventions to improve outcomes and support patient-centered cardiovascular care for underserved patients with HF. The overall objective of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that a novel app, mi.Symptoms can meaningfully alter patient-reported and clinical outcomes of patients with HF and lead to more successful symptom recognition, response and communication with healthcare providers. The central hypothesis is that empowering patients to take more control of their symptom experience using a technology-enabled point-of-care symptom reporting intervention (mi.Symptoms) can meaningfully alter symptom response behaviors the clinical outcomes of patients with HF. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in the K99 phase of the study by pursing the following specific aims: 1) test the reliability and validity of mi.Symptoms (a novel mHealth app developed by Dr. Masterson Creber and a team from Columbia University School of Engineering), and 2) assess the usability of mi.Symptoms and examine relationships of its use with changes in patient-reported outcomes in a pilot feasibility study. In the R00 phase of the study, the specific aim is to: 3) examine the efficacy o mi.Symptoms on improving patient-reported and clinical outcomes as compared to usual care. The training plan for this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will enable Dr. Masterson Creber to couple skills in biomedical informatics with clinical trial design and outcomes research. The approach has three innovative features: 1) it is grounded in the Theory of Situation Awareness in Dynamic Systems; 2) there is a close link between the theoretical model and unique functional elements of the mi.Symptoms web app (tailoring to patient preference by choosing an avatar, prompting to report symptoms, reinforcing symptom reporting with hedonic motivation, and decreasing barriers to facilitate communication with providers); and 3) it applies growth modeling to the analysis of multiple symptoms and outcomes over time. Findings from this study will provide insights into the development and testing of mi.Symptoms as well as many other mHealth apps. The research is significant because it addresses the important problem of patients with HF struggling to recognize and respond to their symptoms, and it addresses the health disparity in HF outcomes for Latino patients. To accomplish the aims of this proposed study, a robust mentorship team with internationally and nationally recognized experts has been built, including expertise in biomedical informatics with a focus on mHealth (Dr. Suzanne Bakken), cardiovascular behavioral health and clinical trial design (Dr. Karina Davidson), user-centered design (Dr. Steven Feiner), clinical heart failure management (Dr. Mathew Maurer), symptom monitoring (Dr. Kathleen Hickey), quantitative methodologies (Dr. Christopher Lee), and mHealth application development and testing (Dr. Cornelia Ruland). Since a spectrum of new knowledge and skills regarding biomedical informatics, computer science and user-interfaces, and behavioral health clinical trial design are required for the candidate's career as an independent scientist, this K99/R00 award will be extremely important and necessary to achieve the candidate's career objectives and expand symptom science and the science of self- management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because providing patients with heart failure with an accessible mobile Health application to support symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers may improve patient-reported and clinical outcomes for heart failure and reduce health disparities among Latinos. The proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINR's mission that pertains to improving symptom science and self-management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases.",mHealth for Heart

"A Stepped-Care Telehealth Approach to Treat Distress in Rural Cancer Survivors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychosocial distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, is common in post-treatment cancer survivors and associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including sleep disturbance, fatigue and decreased quality of life (QOL). Interventions that are accessible to post-treatment cancer survivors experiencing significant distress are sorely needed, especially in rural areas where psychosocial care is scarce. Recent national guidelines recommend screening all adults with cancer for distress and treating those with moderate to severe symptoms using a stepped-care approach. The purpose of this pilot study is to implement a stepped- care approach in rural community oncology settings using a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol that includes both self-directed and telehealth approaches. Specific aims are to: (1) determine feasibility (accrual, retention, adherence) of a randomized controlled trial of a stepped-care mental health intervention (tailored to symptom level) versus enhanced usual care (EUC) in 90 rural, post-treatment cancer survivors with moderate to severe levels of distress (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms); (2) obtain preliminary efficacy data for reducing emotional distress and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, fear of recurrence, QOL); and (3) determine intervention costs. We will recruit 90 adult (age ≥18), rural cancer survivors who are 6-24 months post-treatment for female breast, colorectal, prostate, or gynecologic cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and who report clinically significant anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants will be stratified by symptom severity and randomized to stepped-care or EUC. For participants with moderate symptoms, low- intensity, stepped care will consist of a self-guided CBT workbook and biweekly check-in calls to assess changes in symptom severity/immediate need for psychiatric treatment and to provide minimal support. For participants with moderate to severe symptoms, high-intensity stepped care will consist of a CBT workbook and psychotherapy delivered by telephone. Participants randomized to EUC will receive survivorship resources and referral information for local mental health providers. Measures will be administered by telephone and mail at pre-, mid- and post-intervention. The proposed study efficiently builds on prior and current research and leverages the existing NCI-funded Research Base infrastructure. The innovation of this work is its focus on addressing a mental health disparity among rural cancer survivors through a stepped-care intervention. After this study is completed, we will implement a fully-powered study in the community cancer setting. The resultant intervention will have great potential for widespread dissemination since it will be manualized, delivered by telephone, and comprised of modules to allow customized treatments for individuals with different cancer types. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental health issues in post-treatment adult cancer survivors are associated with multiple adverse outcomes and may represent a cancer health disparity for rural survivors. The purpose of this study is to test a stepped- care approach tailored to symptom severity based on recent American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for reducing emotional distress (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms) and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, fear of recurrence, quality of life) in rural, post-treatment cancer survivors in community oncology settings and to examine intervention costs. The resultant intervention will have great potential for widespread dissemination since it will be manualized, delivered by telephone, and comprised of modules to allow customized treatments for individuals with different cancer types.",A Stepped-Care Telehealth Approach to Treat Distress in Rural Cancer Survivors,9262174,R21CA198237,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"Sex differences in amygdala function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite a higher incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in females, and sex differences in the expression of symptoms, the neurobiological underpinnings of sex differences in affective behaviors are not well understood. Dysfunction of the amygdala contributes to these disorders, yet it is unknown whether there are sex differences in amygdala neuronal function, or in amygdala susceptibility in psychopathology. Targeting of sex differences in amygdala pathology is expected to provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of affective disorders. The objective of this project is to test whether differences exist in amygdala physiology and function in females and males, and whether a stress model that shares features with mood disorders exerts sex-dependent effects on the amygdala. This project will test the central hypothesis that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in females is more responsive than the BLA in males, that this difference is specific for subcircuits of BLA neurons, and that stress decreases neuronal excitability and function of the BLA in females, but exerts opposite effects on BLA function in males. This project will test the contribution of ion channels that regulate BLA neuronal excitability to the sex differences, and key enzymes that modulate the function of these ion channels. In addition, this project will also test whether pharmacologica manipulation of these novel ion channel and enzymatic targets reverses the behavioral impact of stress. The rationale for these studies is that the mechanism for sex differences in amygdala-dependent behaviors and the impact of stress on these behaviors is not known. These issues need to be understood to determine the role of the amygdala in sex differences in mood disorder symptomology. The Aims of this proposal are to test if sex differences in BLA neuronal excitability is specific for BLA subcircuits, if the effects of repeated stress on BLA function are sex dependent, and if the effects can be reversed in a sex-dependent manner. This will be tested using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological approaches, combined with biochemical and behavioral approaches. These Aims are expected to demonstrate sex differences in the physiology of the BLA, the effects of repeated stress on BLA physiology and function, and that pharmacological targeting of the effects of stress will reverse impairments in a sex-dependent manner. This can lead to novel insight into the cause of sex differences in mood and anxiety disorders, and lead to a novel sex-dependent therapeutic approach for rapid treatment of mood disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project is important for public health because of the need to understand the causes of psychiatric disorders, and to reduce sex disparities in mental health. Women have a higher prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders than men and display differences in symptomology. Compounded on this, current antidepressant medications may take months to reach clinical efficacy. The research proposed here can lead to novel insight into the cause of sex differences in mood disorders, and lead to a novel sex-dependent therapeutic approach for rapid treatment of mood disorders.",Sex differences in amygdala function,9186004,R01MH100536,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' protein blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Empathy ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Metestrus ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Pathology ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiology ', ' Proestrus ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Lateral ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Protein Subunits ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Estrous Cycle ', ' protein expression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' conditioned fear ', ' fear conditioning ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' in vivo ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' human female ', ' restraint stress ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' balance testing ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' mood symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,ROSALIND FRANKLIN UNIV OF MEDICINE & SCI,R01,2017,386250,-0.007416228225926346
"The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants of Health (SEMOARS)  during Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Project Summary Abstract Abstract: The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants (SEMOARS) Background: Black women with breast cancer in the United States have a lower 5 year survival than whites for stage-matched disease. Our past and ongoing work and that of others suggests that symptom incidence, cancer related distress and ineffective communication contribute to racial disparity in dose reduction and early therapy termination. Aims:1) Examine and compare chemotherapy received/chemotherapy prescribed over time and in total of matched black and white women prescribed BC chemotherapy. 2) Examine and compare the symptom incidence, distress and management, clinical encounter including patient centeredness of care and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy over time. 2a) Correlate the symptom incidence symptom incidence, distress and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy to Aim 1. 3) Explore the effects of social determinants of health including age, income, education, zip code and lifetime stress exposure on Aims 1, 2 and 3. Hypothesis: Inherent differences including race and possibly social determinants of health between black and white women in the experience, perception, communication and outcomes of symptoms during breast cancer chemotherapy interfere with chemotherapy adherence. Methods: Longitudinal frequent repeated-measures (18 data collections), comparative, mixed methods (audiotapes of clinic visits) descriptive design of 179 white and 179 black women from 6 sites at Western Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio over the course of chemotherapy. Innovation: The intense assessment of symptoms, distress and quality of life and the clinical encounter in multiple repeated measures as compared by race and social determinants of health on the ability to receive full dose chemotherapy is patient centered and innovative. Significance/Public Health: If these relationships and racial differences are confirmed and the mediating factors identified as actionable targets, this information will fill a critical gap in the quality care literature, advancing the understanding and potential mitigation strategies for the static racial survival disparity in breast cancer. These identified targets hold implication for public health. Project Narrative  This proposal, in response to PA-16-160, National Institute of Minority Health and Disparity (NIMHD) Research Project Grant (Parent R01) has the goal of creating an important explanatory model regarding the process of symptom experience, symptom reporting, management and symptom outcomes leading to the ability to receive full dose of prescribed therapy according to race and considering social determinants for women receiving breast cancer chemotherapy. Defining barriers to receiving full dose and timely therapeutics are an important strategy for mitigation of treatment and survival disparity in breast cancer.","The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants of Health (SEMOARS)  during Breast Cancer Chemotherapy",9422820,R01MD012245,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Audiotape ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Empathy ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Ohio ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Distress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Severities ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' chemotherapy ', ' comparative ', ' social health determinants ', ' Regimen ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' survival outcome ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,711829,-0.06901114744645719
"Lifecourse cardiovascular risk, depression and cognition in black & white adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive function and depressive symptoms share many cardiovascular origins and their prevalence increases dramatically with age. Emerging evidence suggests that the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes progresses over the life course and may be different in older adults compared to middle-aged and younger adults. Racial disparities in cardiovascular risk factors and the age at which they develop may further exacerbate these associations. This 5-year K01 award application seeks to improve our knowledge of the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive function and depressive symptoms over the life course in black and white adults. Additionally, this proposal will elucidate the role of cardiovascular risk factors with underlying structural brain changes over the life course. This proposal involves analyses of two large biracial epidemiologic cohorts: including 1) the ongoing CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study of 5,115 young adult to middle-aged men and women (52% blacks and 48% whites), and 2) the ongoing Health ABC (Health, Aging and Body Composition) study of 3,075 older adult men and women (42% blacks and 58% whites). We hypothesize that greater exposure to non-optimal cardiovascular measures will be associated with worse cognitive function, greater number of depressive symptoms, and worse structural brain indices such as greater white matter lesions and hippocampal atrophy across the life course in blacks and whites. The data structure of the cohorts will enable us to evaluate several life course epidemiologic models such as early vs. late life cardiovascular exposure, with the possibility of evaluating sensitive periods. This life course approach is mirrored in the scientifi aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, we will determine how young adulthood and midlife cardiovascular exposure (CARDIA) and late life cardiovascular exposure (Health ABC) influence trajectories of depressive symptoms. In Aims 2 and 3, we will determine how young adulthood cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive performance and structural brain integrity at midlife (CARDIA) and how late life cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive decline and structural brain integrity in late life (Health ABC). The proposed analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan that will (1) advance my conceptual training in the clinical aspect of cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular aspects in particular; (2) train me in neuroimaging and markers of structural brain integrity; and (3) advance my methodologic training in longitudinal and neuroimaging related statistical methods and my knowledge of life course models. My training plan will include formal courses, clinical assessment and grand rounds, attendance at scholarly seminars, directed readings and professional development activities specifically tailored to my training goals.

"Targeting School Climate and Children's Behavioral Health in Urban Schools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unmet need for mental health services is extraordinarily high among urban children of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. As overall need continues to rise, schools are fast becoming the main source of mental health services for children. Externalizing behavior disorders and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in low-income urban children. Unfortunately, evidence-based interventions (EBI) for those disorders are seldom employed in urban schools. School-Wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS), a multi-level services delivery strategy that combines universal and targeted interventions, has been found to be effective in improving school climate, perceived school safety, and student reading scores. Targeted group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) can be provided to at-risk and high-risk students as part of the SWPBS system. Unfortunately, SWPBS and GCBT are seldom employed in under-resourced urban schools, in part, because school districts do not have enough resources to contract outside providers with expertise in EBIs for behavioral health problems. Also, widespread deployment of EBIs to ""real world"" settings has been hampered by problems such as inadequate training of service providers and poor implementation fidelity. The creation of mechanisms for the training and support of counselors and other school personnel that focus on maintaining high implementation fidelity and integrity can facilitate a significant increase in the use of EBIs in urban schools and contribute to lowering behavioral health disparities.  The overall purpose of this project is to determine whether school personnel implementing a two-tier SWPBS program for typically developing children and children with, or at risk for, externalizing or anxiety disorders, can implement the components of the program with the same level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness when they receive a Low Level of Support (LLS) from their coaches and supervisors as compared to a High Level of Support (HLS). We also want to determine whether school personnel who receive HLS for two years could continue to implement the components of the program with a similar level of fidelity and integrity and clinical effectiveness while receiving LLS during the following two years. We will calculate the total costs and net costs associated with the development and implementation of the SWPBS program. The study uses a cohort-sequential design and follows 6 separate K-8 schools in the Philadelphia School District, yielding approximately 48 leadership team members, 180 school personnel, and 3,900 students in Tier 1, and 12 counselors, 84 groups of 4-5 children with, or at risk for, oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder in each CBT group, and 3-4 children with, or at risk for, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, o social phobia in each CBT group, for a total of 306 evaluable child participants. Schools will be randomly assigned to receive either HLS or LLS from project staff. The proposed study is consistent with the current strategic plan of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), particularly the commitment to support research that addresses barriers to school readiness and academic success for minority and low-income children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Demonstrating that school personnel can implement evidence-based interventions (EBI) for externalizing and anxiety problems with a high degree of fidelity, integrity and clinical effectiveness under varying levels of support could spur more initiatives toward the adoption of EBIs in urban schools, thus further lowering health disparities in these settings.",Targeting School Climate and Children's Behavioral Health in Urban Schools,9197319,R01HD073430,"['Adoption ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health Services ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mission ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Perception ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Social Phobia ', ' Productivity ', ' Program Development ', ' Reading ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' School Health Services ', ' School-Based Services ', ' Schools ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Students ', ' Supervision ', ' Training Support ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Latino ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' Secondary to ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' Discipline ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Emotional ', ' behavioral health ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Separation Anxiety Disorder ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Evaluable ', ' Evaluable Disease ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' school district ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' incremental cost-effectiveness ', ' urban school ', ' ']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2017,601956,0.035589565957809065
"Psychoneurological Symptoms in Situationally Stressed Low Income Mothers Project Summary/Abstract  In the United States, more than 10% of mothers, or 8.5 million, live in poverty, placing the mothers in conditions of chronic situational stress. Low income mothers are exposed to chronic situational stress, due in part to the economic hardship and additional stressors associated with the responsibilities of motherhood. Exposure to economic hardship is associated with higher reports of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and cognitive dysfunction, known as the psychoneurological symptoms. These symptoms can significantly impair a mother by interfering with her ability to function and mother. Compromises to a mother's functioning places her children at higher lifetime risks of impaired cognitive and emotional development; infants and toddlers are the most vulnerable to these consequences. To date, attempts to intervene on situational stress-related symptoms in low income mothers have focused on depressive symptoms. These interventions have met with varied levels of efficacy. The limited efficacy may be because interventions addressing depressive symptoms do not include pain, which is experienced by 50% of low income mothers. An alternative and novel approach is to reconceptualize the stress-related symptoms as psychoneurological symptoms in order to consider underlying biological mechanisms that could be targeted by interventions.  The proposed study will describe psychoneurological symptoms in a sample of low income mothers under chronic situational stress and determine the associations of the symptoms with situational stress and with maternal and child outcomes. This study will be a secondary analysis of data from 356 low income mothers and will combine the data from two parent studies conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The proposed study will analyze key variables of situational stress, psychoneurological symptoms, maternal functioning, and child behavior and development. The project has three aims: to describe the intensity of the psychoneurological symptoms by comparing a simple, data-naïve approach (composite score) against a complex, innovative data-driven approach (reduced rank regression); to use multiple regression analyses to explore how variations in levels of chronic situational stress are associated with intensity of psychoneurological symptoms; and to use multiple regression analyses to determine the relationship of psychoneurological symptoms to mother's functional status (physical functioning, social functioning, role functioning, mothering) and child behavioral and developmental status.  This study addresses NINR's Innovative Questions in Symptom Science concerning the impact of adverse symptoms across diverse populations by researching the behavioral dynamics of symptoms (1-1) and how lifestyle factors and environmental conditions impact symptoms (1-3). The findings from this study will be the first step towards determining personalized biomarkers of psychoneurological symptoms and, eventually, developing targeted symptom management interventions to improve quality of life for the mothers. Project Narrative This project will link symptoms (pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and cognitive dysfunction) that are often experienced by low income mothers to the high levels of stress in their lives and describe the impact of those symptoms on their functioning and the health of their children. Positive outcomes of the project will support future identification of what causes these symptoms biologically and, ultimately, lead to the development of strategies to help low income mothers better manage their symptoms.  ",Psychoneurological Symptoms in Situationally Stressed Low Income Mothers,9393384,F31NR017106,"['Behavioral Research ', ' Breast ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Neurosciences ', ' North Carolina ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' motherhood ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' functional status ', ' monoamine ', ' skills ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' member ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' disturbance in affect ', ' mood dysfunction ', ' mood disturbance ', ' mood and affect disturbance ', ' mood alteration ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Subgroup ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' Social Functioning ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' symptom science ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NINR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2017,35011,0.0670835076927576
"Mutations in HCFC1 alter neural precursor differentiation Project Summary My overarching scientific goal is to develop a cross disciplinary research program that utilizes zebrafish as a model organism to understand the molecular basis of developmental disorders. I am a tenure track assistant professor at The University of Texas El Paso (UTEP), a Hispanic serving institution, located on the US/Mexican border. UTEP is dedicated to addressing the emerging challenges of the border region and has developed the Border Biomedical Research Center (BBRC), a component of the National Institutes of Health Disparities Research Centers in Minority Institutions Program (RCMI) to expand biomedical research and strengthen the research infrastructure within the region. My research complements the goals of both UTEP and the BBRC, thus I am perfectly positioned to develop a successful cross disciplinary research program.  The goal of this K01 mentored career science award is “to provide a research intensive mentored experience, which will ultimately increase the candidate’s level of competitiveness for future R01 level funding.” To meet this goal, we propose a research intensive training plan, which focuses primarily on improving my publication record and providing high level training in grant writing by utilizing programs sponsored by the National Research Mentoring Network (NMRN) and the American Society for Cell Biology. We will complement these initiatives by enhancing my leadership skills and my professional network. Therefore, at the end of this award, I will have received expert training appropriate to my current position, which will improve my competitiveness for R-level funding.  The focus of the current proposal is understand the underlying mechanisms associated with mutations in the HCFC1 transcriptional cofactor. Mutations in HCFC1 cause cobalamin X disorder (cblX), a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome associated with severe neurological and neurodevelopmental deficits. In vitro studies suggest HCFC1 functions to modulate neural precursor differentiation, but these results have not been confirmed in vivo because HCFC1 is present on the X-chromosome in humans and mice and is subject to X- linked compensatory mechanisms which limit the production of homozygous recessive conditional knockout mice. Zebrafish do not have sex chromosomes and therefore represent a unique and powerful system in which to understand the function of in HCFC1. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are 1) to determine the function of HCFC1 in neural precursor specification, proliferation, and differentiation in vivo and 2) to determine whether HCFC1 regulates brain development by modulating the expression of the MMACHC gene. The results of these data will help to identify novel pathways and therapeutic targets for neurological disorders associated with defects in neural precursor function. Project Narrative Mutations in the HCFC1 gene have been found in patients with multiple congenital anomalies suffering from debilitating neurological impairment and intellectual disability. However, there is a clear gap in our understanding of how mutation of HCFC1 can cause disease. The work proposed here will use zebrafish as a model system to understand how HCFC1 regulates both normal development and disease.",Mutations in HCFC1 alter neural precursor

"Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan, from development through aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female- specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each of the two Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interests. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either their known higher incidence and/or differential expression in women than men and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we believe that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education, training, and development of junior investigators who will commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-dependent treatment approaches and public awareness of the importance of these sex-dependent health issues for families and society.",Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside,9333132,K12HD051959,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Biology ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Genes ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Israel ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Massachusetts ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Puberty ', ' Reading ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Training Programs ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Endocrine ', ' interest ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' DF/HCC ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' translational approach ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2017,378000,0.07466664792192776
"Fostering Supported Education and Employment in First Episode Psychosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All young persons are faced with the decision of how to invest in their human capital development; this normative tension is particularly pronounced for young persons who have experienced a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Interruptions in their education and employment following FEP can lead not only to poor socioeconomic outcomes, but also impair psychiatric recovery. FEP treatment programs have demonstrated effectiveness in improving outcomes and reducing the probability of disability for newly-diagnosed young persons with schizophrenia and related disorders. FEP programs have indicated a need for knowledge to help clients navigate the developmental milestone of choosing investments in school and work. Training Plan: This K01 Award will train the candidate to become an independent investigator conducting policy analysis to improve psychiatric and socioeconomic outcomes for persons with psychiatric disorders. This K01 will provide training in 1) clinical and policy elements of FEP treatment and 2) SEE services, 3) the impact of racial/ethnic disparities on SEE access and engagement, and 4) methodological training in mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods data collection and analysis. These skills, combined with my quantitative analysis training and commitment to promoting socioeconomic recovery of individuals with psychiatric disorders, will give me the tools I need to launch an independent research career. Research Plan: This study will develop policy recommendations to help policymakers and program leaders identify how best to provide SEE services to clients with FEP, to enable clients to make a meaningful choice of SEE services. The Specific Aims are: 1) To identify predictors of human capital attainment in a population-based survey among persons who report symptoms of psychosis, prior to the availability of comprehensive FEP programs; 2) To identify predictors, barriers, and challenges to the use of SEE services in FEP treatment programs; and 3) To examine SEE and FEP service utilization patterns over the duration of FEP treatment. Methodology: The mentored research project will encompass secondary data analyses from a nationally-representative sample of US adults (the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys), from the Improving Work Outcomes study at the University of California Los Angeles, and from the New York State initiative, OnTrackNY. Primary data will be collected from semi-structured interviews with program staff at existing FEP programs, and staff and clients at the New York State OnTrackNY initiative. A meta-analysis will be conducted with data from OnTrackNY and the Recovering After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Connection. At the conclusion of the K01, the findings will be reviewed by OnTrackNY leadership, to lay out a series of policy options that can help to improve SEE service delivery and utilization.

"Sex differences in amygdala function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite a higher incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in females, and sex differences in the expression of symptoms, the neurobiological underpinnings of sex differences in affective behaviors are not well understood. Dysfunction of the amygdala contributes to these disorders, yet it is unknown whether there are sex differences in amygdala neuronal function, or in amygdala susceptibility in psychopathology. Targeting of sex differences in amygdala pathology is expected to provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of affective disorders. The objective of this project is to test whether differences exist in amygdala physiology and function in females and males, and whether a stress model that shares features with mood disorders exerts sex-dependent effects on the amygdala. This project will test the central hypothesis that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in females is more responsive than the BLA in males, that this difference is specific for subcircuits of BLA neurons, and that stress decreases neuronal excitability and function of the BLA in females, but exerts opposite effects on BLA function in males. This project will test the contribution of ion channels that regulate BLA neuronal excitability to the sex differences, and key enzymes that modulate the function of these ion channels. In addition, this project will also test whether pharmacologica manipulation of these novel ion channel and enzymatic targets reverses the behavioral impact of stress. The rationale for these studies is that the mechanism for sex differences in amygdala-dependent behaviors and the impact of stress on these behaviors is not known. These issues need to be understood to determine the role of the amygdala in sex differences in mood disorder symptomology. The Aims of this proposal are to test if sex differences in BLA neuronal excitability is specific for BLA subcircuits, if the effects of repeated stress on BLA function are sex dependent, and if the effects can be reversed in a sex-dependent manner. This will be tested using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological approaches, combined with biochemical and behavioral approaches. These Aims are expected to demonstrate sex differences in the physiology of the BLA, the effects of repeated stress on BLA physiology and function, and that pharmacological targeting of the effects of stress will reverse impairments in a sex-dependent manner. This can lead to novel insight into the cause of sex differences in mood and anxiety disorders, and lead to a novel sex-dependent therapeutic approach for rapid treatment of mood disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project is important for public health because of the need to understand the causes of psychiatric disorders, and to reduce sex disparities in mental health. Women have a higher prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders than men and display differences in symptomology. Compounded on this, current antidepressant medications may take months to reach clinical efficacy. The research proposed here can lead to novel insight into the cause of sex differences in mood disorders, and lead to a novel sex-dependent therapeutic approach for rapid treatment of mood disorders.",Sex differences in amygdala function,9385750,R01MH100536,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Empathy ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Metestrus ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Pathology ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiology ', ' Proestrus ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Lateral ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Protein Subunits ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Estrous Cycle ', ' protein expression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' conditioned fear ', ' fear conditioning ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' in vivo ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' human female ', ' restraint stress ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' balance testing ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' mood symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,ROSALIND FRANKLIN UNIV OF MEDICINE & SCI,R01,2018,386250,-0.007416228225926346
"Implementation and Evaluation of an Expanded Bilingual Electronic Symptom Management Program across a Multi-site, Fully-integrated Comprehensive Cancer Center Cancer, and cancer treatment, cause many symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life. Despite the development of improved symptom management interventions, and several evidence- and consensus-based guidelines, their timely delivery remains uneven in the health care system. Our research center, Northwestern University IMPACT (NU IMPACT), builds upon an integrated cancer symptom monitoring and management system (NMPRO), currently deployed by our health care delivery system. We will test the effectiveness of a system-wide symptom management intervention when implemented across the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Corporation (NMHC) outpatient oncology clinics. Using a clinic-level randomized roll-out implementation trial design, we will further test, using an embedded patient-level randomized controlled clinical trial, the effectiveness of an enhanced care (EC) approach aimed to engage participants actively, and to increase self-efficacy, in the monitoring and managing of their symptoms. The existing NMPRO will constitute usual care (UC), and added patient engagement and activation features will comprise the EC condition. This innovative hybrid trial design allows for a within- and between-site evaluation of implementation along with a sufficiently powered group-based comparison to demonstrate effectiveness on individual patient outcomes.  We propose three specific aims that target both patient- and system-level outcomes. Aim 1: Implement a fully-integrated oncology symptom assessment and management program across six clinical units that are part of the NMHC healthcare delivery system; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the program by conducting a hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the enhanced care program (EC: symptom monitoring & self-management intervention), relative to usual care (UC) on patient- and system-level outcomes; Aim 3: Identify facilitators and barriers to implementation and disseminate to other health systems. We will enroll an estimated 12,671 participants. To address possible contamination effects within each clinical unit, and allow for unit-level data collection for pre- and post-implementation comparison within and across clinical units, 50% will be enrolled and followed prior to program implementation. The other half will be enrolled post-implementation and will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (stratified by sex and cancer phase; curative intent, non-curative intent & survivorship) to UC versus EC. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression will be assessed using PROMIS® computerized adaptive tests (CATs). In addition, we will assess patient clinical outcomes, including healthcare utilization, and cancer treatment delivery outcomes. The NU IMPACT study design allows joint evaluation of system-level implementation and patient-level effectiveness metrics. An extensive array of longitudinal EHR data will be integrated using custom informatics tools and deployed for statistical analysis using plans that blend psychometric and biostatistical outcome evaluation models. Successful elements of this intervention approach will then be extended to widespread adoption. The Northwestern University IMPACT (NU IMPACT) proposal builds upon an existing integrated cancer symptom monitoring and management system, and tests its effectiveness across six high-volume outpatient oncology clinics. Using a clinic-level randomized roll-out implementation trial design, including an embedded patient-level randomized controlled clinical trial, we will test the effectiveness of an enhanced care approach aimed to engage participants actively, and to increase self-efficacy, in the monitoring and managing of their symptoms. This innovative Type I hybrid trial design allows for a within- and between-site evaluation of implementation along with a sufficiently powered group-based comparison to demonstrate effectiveness on individual patient outcomes, which can be scaled for widespread use.","Implementation and Evaluation of an Expanded Bilingual Electronic Symptom Management Program across a Multi-site, Fully-integrated Comprehensive Cancer Center",9625977,UM1CA233035,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Data Collection ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Medicine ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Science ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Evaluation ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' tool ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Nature ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' care delivery ', ' Informatics ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' Treatment-Related Cancer ', ' Treatment-Associated Cancer ', ' Therapy-Related Cancer ', ' Therapy-Associated Cancers ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Tumor ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Iatrogenic Cancer ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Gynecologic Oncology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' implementation trial ', ' computerized ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient population ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' clinical practice ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' trial design ', ' mental function ', ' individual patient ', ' painful symptom ', ' pain symptom ', ' patient engagement ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,UM1,2018,7665680,0.05903641782167977
"The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants of Health (SEMOARS)  during Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Project Summary Abstract Abstract: The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants (SEMOARS) Background: Black women with breast cancer in the United States have a lower 5 year survival than whites for stage-matched disease. Our past and ongoing work and that of others suggests that symptom incidence, cancer related distress and ineffective communication contribute to racial disparity in dose reduction and early therapy termination. Aims:1) Examine and compare chemotherapy received/chemotherapy prescribed over time and in total of matched black and white women prescribed BC chemotherapy. 2) Examine and compare the symptom incidence, distress and management, clinical encounter including patient centeredness of care and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy over time. 2a) Correlate the symptom incidence symptom incidence, distress and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy to Aim 1. 3) Explore the effects of social determinants of health including age, income, education, zip code and lifetime stress exposure on Aims 1, 2 and 3. Hypothesis: Inherent differences including race and possibly social determinants of health between black and white women in the experience, perception, communication and outcomes of symptoms during breast cancer chemotherapy interfere with chemotherapy adherence. Methods: Longitudinal frequent repeated-measures (18 data collections), comparative, mixed methods (audiotapes of clinic visits) descriptive design of 179 white and 179 black women from 6 sites at Western Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio over the course of chemotherapy. Innovation: The intense assessment of symptoms, distress and quality of life and the clinical encounter in multiple repeated measures as compared by race and social determinants of health on the ability to receive full dose chemotherapy is patient centered and innovative. Significance/Public Health: If these relationships and racial differences are confirmed and the mediating factors identified as actionable targets, this information will fill a critical gap in the quality care literature, advancing the understanding and potential mitigation strategies for the static racial survival disparity in breast cancer. These identified targets hold implication for public health. Project Narrative  This proposal, in response to PA-16-160, National Institute of Minority Health and Disparity (NIMHD) Research Project Grant (Parent R01) has the goal of creating an important explanatory model regarding the process of symptom experience, symptom reporting, management and symptom outcomes leading to the ability to receive full dose of prescribed therapy according to race and considering social determinants for women receiving breast cancer chemotherapy. Defining barriers to receiving full dose and timely therapeutics are an important strategy for mitigation of treatment and survival disparity in breast cancer.","The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants of Health (SEMOARS)  during Breast Cancer Chemotherapy",9573242,R01MD012245,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Audiotape ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Empathy ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Ohio ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Distress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Severities ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' treatment cessation ', ' cessation of treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' chemotherapy ', ' comparative ', ' social health determinants ', ' Regimen ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' survival outcome ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,652751,-0.06901114744645719
"Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan, from development through aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female- specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each of the two Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interests. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either their known higher incidence and/or differential expression in women than men and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we believe that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education, training, and development of junior investigators who will commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-dependent treatment approaches and public awareness of the importance of these sex-dependent health issues for families and society.",Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside,9536056,K12HD051959,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aging ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Boston ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Genes ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Israel ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Massachusetts ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Puberty ', ' Reading ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Training Programs ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Endocrine ', ' interest ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' DF/HCC ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' child bearing ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench to bedside ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2018,548640,0.07466664792192776
"Coordinating Center for Research Centers for Improving Management of Symptoms During and Following Cancer Treatment Project Summary To advance the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM Initiative to accelerate cancer research and the Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendation to minimize cancer treatment's debilitating side effects, RTI International proposes to serve as the Coordinating Center (CC) for the Research Centers (RCs) for Improving Management of Symptoms Across Cancer Treatments (IMPACT) Consortium. As the CC, RTI will provide leadership, scientific expertise, and logistical support to unite RCs into a cohesive research group that will provide actionable evidence based on implementation science principles to improve symptom management across the cancer treatment continuum (i.e., treatment with curative intent, treatment with noncurative/palliative intent, cancer survivorship) and address the unique challenges of minority and medically underserved populations. Specifically, we will (1) enhance research efficiency, productivity, and impact by facilitating collaboration and providing the logistical, communications, and operational support necessary to run a multicenter research Consortium; (2) facilitate the development of evidence-based symptom management recommendations by establishing processes for harmonized data collection, the use of common data elements, and the application of consistent procedures across studies and research sites; and (3) accelerate adoption of integrated systems for monitoring and managing patient-reported symptoms by developing and applying analytic approaches to IMPACT pooled data and collaborating with RCs and other stakeholder to broadly disseminate findings. This application has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the Consortium: (1) Under the leadership of Dr. Barbara Kroner, the CC will foster collaboration within the IMPACT Consortium by uniting diverse researchers around shared goals and harmonized studies to advance the research agenda. (2) RTI will promote effective communication by developing custom web-based tools for communications, document sharing, and online trainings; establishing and leading SC working groups in topics relevant to IMPACT (e.g., Health Disparities; Implementation Science; Data Management, Statistics, and Informatics). (3) RTI will use a common implementation framework (i.e., Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)) combined with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research) to concurrently evaluate multilevel factors that can influence clinical practice by assessing both effectiveness and implementation outcomes. (4) RTI will leverage data standards and harmonization across the Consortium to catalyze data sharing and aggregation. (5) RTI will advocate for a Stakeholder Advisory Group to guide and inform pooled study design, data collection, analyses, and interpretation of study findings. (6) RTI will combine the harmonized data with planned pooled analyses which will yield optimal management system models for implementing integrated systems into routine clinical practice and use implementation science approaches to accelerate adoption of integrated systems and sustain changes in clinical practice.

"Effectiveness and Implementation of a Mindfulness Intervention for Depressive Symptoms Among Low-income, Racial/Ethnic Minority Adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center The objective of this R01 (PA-16-160) application is to examine the clinical effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention on reducing depressive symptoms among socio-economically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic minority adults and explore factors related to implementation in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). This research will be used to develop a generalizable model for delivery of streamlined mental health interventions in community based settings that will be broadly disseminated and scalable to other populations. Black and Hispanic adults are more likely than those who are White to receive depression treatment in primary care, where antidepressants are the most commonly offered treatment. However, Black and Hispanic adults are less likely than Whites to find antidepressants acceptable. A mindfulness depression intervention provided within primary care may be more accessible and acceptable for low-income, racial/ethnic minority individuals, a severely underserved population. Accumulating research suggests that mindfulness interventions reduce the inflammatory response that can be triggered by stress and improves psychological outcomes. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the clinical effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention (M-Body) on reducing depressive symptoms, compared to usual care, among low-income racial/ethnic minority adults in a FQHC. In preliminary studies, women ages 18-65 with depressive symptoms were recruited from a FQHC to participate in the 8-week, 90 minute per session M-Body intervention. The M-Body intervention is based on Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and has been tailored for the FQHC setting and patient population. Data from four pilot groups led by the PI (N=31) and FQHC health educator (N=41) provide evidence of acceptability, feasibility and improved depressive symptom and stress outcomes over time. Adults (N=330) with depressive symptoms will be recruited from a FQHC in the Chicago, IL area that serves majority racial/ethnic minority individuals (90%) living at or below the poverty line (74%). Half of the patients will be randomized to the M-Body intervention arm where they will receive 8-weeks of mindfulness training led by FQHC staff and the other half will be randomized to usual care. Information on factors relevant to implementation of the intervention in the FQHC will be obtained by convening a series of workgroups and individual interviews with FQHC staff, executive leadership and community stakeholders. Specific Aims: 1) Determine the effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention (M-Body) on reducing depressive symptoms compared to enhanced usual care for racial/ethnic minority adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC); 2) Explore potential mediators (stress related biomarkers, mindfulness) and moderators (age, personal, social, environmental stressors) of the intervention's effect; 3) Conduct a broad assessment of organizational and individual agency factors related to preparation and implementation of the M-Body intervention in a FQHC using a mixed methods approach. Mindfulness based interventions for depression delivered in Federally Qualified Health Centers are a promising approach to providing accessible and acceptable mental health treatment to underserved populations in community based settings. This study will examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention on reducing depressive symptoms among socio-economically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic minority adults and explore factors related to implementation in a FQHC. The findings will be used to develop a generalizable model of delivering streamlined mental health interventions in community settings that can be scalable to wider populations.","Effectiveness and Implementation of a Mindfulness Intervention for Depressive Symptoms Among Low-income, Racial/Ethnic Minority Adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center",9543069,R01MD012236,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' instructor ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' social ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health Educators ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' mind body wellness ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body approach ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' daily functioning ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' emotional factor ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mindfulness ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' recruit ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,415377,-0.0020673810491324465

"A Stepped-Care Telehealth Approach to Treat Distress in Rural Cancer Survivors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychosocial distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, is common in post-treatment cancer survivors and associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including sleep disturbance, fatigue and decreased quality of life (QOL). Interventions that are accessible to post-treatment cancer survivors experiencing significant distress are sorely needed, especially in rural areas where psychosocial care is scarce. Recent national guidelines recommend screening all adults with cancer for distress and treating those with moderate to severe symptoms using a stepped-care approach. The purpose of this pilot study is to implement a stepped- care approach in rural community oncology settings using a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol that includes both self-directed and telehealth approaches. Specific aims are to: (1) determine feasibility (accrual, retention, adherence) of a randomized controlled trial of a stepped-care mental health intervention (tailored to symptom level) versus enhanced usual care (EUC) in 90 rural, post-treatment cancer survivors with moderate to severe levels of distress (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms); (2) obtain preliminary efficacy data for reducing emotional distress and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, fear of recurrence, QOL); and (3) determine intervention costs. We will recruit 90 adult (age ≥18), rural cancer survivors who are 6-24 months post-treatment for female breast, colorectal, prostate, or gynecologic cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and who report clinically significant anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants will be stratified by symptom severity and randomized to stepped-care or EUC. For participants with moderate symptoms, low- intensity, stepped care will consist of a self-guided CBT workbook and biweekly check-in calls to assess changes in symptom severity/immediate need for psychiatric treatment and to provide minimal support. For participants with moderate to severe symptoms, high-intensity stepped care will consist of a CBT workbook and psychotherapy delivered by telephone. Participants randomized to EUC will receive survivorship resources and referral information for local mental health providers. Measures will be administered by telephone and mail at pre-, mid- and post-intervention. The proposed study efficiently builds on prior and current research and leverages the existing NCI-funded Research Base infrastructure. The innovation of this work is its focus on addressing a mental health disparity among rural cancer survivors through a stepped-care intervention. After this study is completed, we will implement a fully-powered study in the community cancer setting. The resultant intervention will have great potential for widespread dissemination since it will be manualized, delivered by telephone, and comprised of modules to allow customized treatments for individuals with different cancer types. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental health issues in post-treatment adult cancer survivors are associated with multiple adverse outcomes and may represent a cancer health disparity for rural survivors. The purpose of this study is to test a stepped- care approach tailored to symptom severity based on recent American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for reducing emotional distress (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms) and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, fear of recurrence, quality of life) in rural, post-treatment cancer survivors in community oncology settings and to examine intervention costs.

"Symptom and Healthcare Access Reporting and Evaluation (SHARE) for Supportive Care Equity PROJECT ABSTRACT Cancer patients experience many troubling symptoms during treatment, including pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. However, symptom burden is not equally shared across racial/ethnic groups, with Black cancer patients reporting greater symptom burden than their White counterparts. Such disparities in symptom burden are particularly concerning as poorly managed symptoms contribute to lower health related quality of life and worse clinical outcomes. It is also well established, across multiple studies, that minorities report worse health care access (HCA) than Whites, leading to disparities in health care outcomes. However, understanding of the contribution of multiple, co-occurring HCA challenges to health care inequities is lacking, as is evidence on the contribution of HCA to symptom burden inequities. My long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in addressing inequities in supportive cancer care (i.e., care that optimizes comfort, function, and social support across the cancer care continuum) through the use of innovative health informatics tools that address systemic barriers to care. In collaboration with my mentoring team, I have developed a training and research plan to achieve my career goal. Specifically, I will acquire intensive training in 1) structural equation modeling approaches relevant to disentangling mediators of cancer care inequities; 2) health informatics integration in clinical practice; 3) the application of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in supportive cancer care; and 4) longitudinal intervention study design and evaluation. I will leverage my career development training to identify subgroups of cancer patients with similar HCA experiences, and examine the contribution of HCA to racial differences in symptom burden in a cohort of Black and White cancer patients enrolled in the North Carolina Health Registry Cancer Survivorship Cohort. With this understanding, I will then develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of an electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO) tool designed to routinely monitor both, symptoms and HCA in a cohort of Black and White cancer patients. Existing e-PRO tools rarely collect data on HCA and, to my knowledge, have not been evaluated in racially-diverse cancer patients, potentially leading to missed opportunities for identifying and addressing access-related challenges that might underlie or exacerbate disparities in symptom burden. The rationale for this project is that routinely monitoring symptoms and symptom- relevant HCA over time will lead to more timely and patient-centered symptom management, especially among Black cancer patients who report greater symptom burden and worse HCA relative to Whites. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses a serious and understudied gap in supportive cancer care: effective strategies for mitigating racial disparities in cancer-related symptom burden. Specifically, the proposed research will elucidate the contribution of health care access inequities to racial disparities in symptom burden in order to inform the development of a novel electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO) tool designed to routinely monitor symptoms and symptom-relevant health care access challenges. The proposed e-PRO tool has the potential to prompt more equitable provision of supportive care services and lead to improved cancer care outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities experiencing excess symptom burden and more barriers to care.",Symptom and Healthcare Access Reporting and Evaluation (SHARE) for Supportive Care Equity,9527429,K01CA218473,"['Anxiety ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' North Carolina ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Summary Reports ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sleeplessness ', ' Insomnia Disorder ', ' Insomnia ', ' Documentation ', ' cancer care ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' usability ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' clinical practice ', ' health data ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' recruit ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' Wait Time ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2018,160133,0.09210891819233859
"Impact of Race-Related Violence Exposure and Discrimination on Threat-Related Negative Valence Systems and Racial Disparities in Anxiety Interpersonal violence (IPV) exposure affects 1 in 2 youth and levies tremendous physical and mental health burdens on victims and society. Childhood IPV exposure is a well-established risk factor for anxiety and other mental health problems across the lifespan. There is great variability among youth in the nature and timing of IPV exposure and considerable heterogeneity in mental health outcomes. Such heterogeneity in outcomes may be explained by various Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs, including Negative Valence Systems (NVS) involving responses to threat. That is, disruptions in the functioning and development of neural and physiological systems associated with threat processing may account for heightened anxiety symptoms commonly observed following IPV. A paucity of longitudinal studies assessing multiple threat-related mechanisms, across multiple units of analysis, and at key times in development has been a critical barrier to informing the design of personalized treatments to target root causes of post-IPV psychopathology. The overarching goal of this project is to examine developmental trajectories of threat-related NVS measures in adolescence, as a function of exposure to IPV, in an effort to better link IPV and anxiety through changes in these measures. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to identify the threat-related NVS mechanisms that connect IPV to anxious symptoms in youth cross-sectionally; 2) to investigate longitudinally the degree to which IPV sensitizes trajectories of NVS measures over a three-year period; and 3) to investigate the degree to which trajectories of NVS measures predict anxiety symptoms over time after accounting for initial anxiety symptoms and IPV status. An exploratory aim is to identify moderators (e.g., puberty) of IPV, threat-related NVS, and anxiety symptom associations. To accomplish the aims, the approach involves studying the contributions of three threat-related NVS constructs, including responses to acute threat, potential threat, and sustained threat. These constructs will be measured across multiple units of analysis (neural circuitry, physiology, behavior/self-report) and over time using a battery of well-validated translational neuroscience laboratory paradigms and assessment tools (e.g., fMRI, EEG, startle, cortisol reactivity). An accelerated longitudinal cohort design will be used to test key developmental questions. Three cohorts of children (total n=360; grades 3, 6, 9 at baseline) and their caregivers will be enrolled and prospectively followed for 3 years. Consistent with RDoC priorities, a community sample representing a broad continuum of IPV experiences and a wide range of anxiety symptoms will be recruited. By studying multiple NVS constructs over time across multiple units of analysis, findings will clarify the timing and developmental course of psychobiological vulnerabilities to anxiety problems in IPV-exposed youth, impact clinical care and future clinical research classification, and test the validity of the RDoC threat-related NVS matrix (e.g., whether responses to potential vs. sustained threat are uniquely related to IPV and outcomes or explain the same variance) in youth.   Childhood exposure to interpersonal violence is prevalent and associated with increased vulnerability to devastating forms of emotional distress, such as anxiety and depression. The central goal of this project is to improve understanding of how childhood violence exposure impacts mental health by studying the links between patterns of violence exposure, aspects of biological and psychological functioning, and different types of emotional distress across key developmental transitions from childhood into adolescence. By identifying mechanisms that connect violence exposure to mental health problems, results of this study will inform improvements to current strategies for assessment, diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prevention of emotional distress among violence-exposed youth.  ",Impact of Race-Related Violence Exposure and Discrimination on Threat-Related Negative Valence Systems and Racial Disparities in Anxiety,9495414,R01MH112209,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Panic ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Puberty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' self reported behavior ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' clinical care ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Negative Valence ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxiety states ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Developmental Course ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predicting response ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' common symptom ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' recruit ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIMH,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2018,191429,0.00415907206421615
"Mutations in HCFC1 alter neural precursor differentiation Project Summary My overarching scientific goal is to develop a cross disciplinary research program that utilizes zebrafish as a model organism to understand the molecular basis of developmental disorders. I am a tenure track assistant professor at The University of Texas El Paso (UTEP), a Hispanic serving institution, located on the US/Mexican border. UTEP is dedicated to addressing the emerging challenges of the border region and has developed the Border Biomedical Research Center (BBRC), a component of the National Institutes of Health Disparities Research Centers in Minority Institutions Program (RCMI) to expand biomedical research and strengthen the research infrastructure within the region. My research complements the goals of both UTEP and the BBRC, thus I am perfectly positioned to develop a successful cross disciplinary research program.  The goal of this K01 mentored career science award is “to provide a research intensive mentored experience, which will ultimately increase the candidate’s level of competitiveness for future R01 level funding.” To meet this goal, we propose a research intensive training plan, which focuses primarily on improving my publication record and providing high level training in grant writing by utilizing programs sponsored by the National Research Mentoring Network (NMRN) and the American Society for Cell Biology. We will complement these initiatives by enhancing my leadership skills and my professional network. Therefore, at the end of this award, I will have received expert training appropriate to my current position, which will improve my competitiveness for R-level funding.  The focus of the current proposal is understand the underlying mechanisms associated with mutations in the HCFC1 transcriptional cofactor. Mutations in HCFC1 cause cobalamin X disorder (cblX), a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome associated with severe neurological and neurodevelopmental deficits. In vitro studies suggest HCFC1 functions to modulate neural precursor differentiation, but these results have not been confirmed in vivo because HCFC1 is present on the X-chromosome in humans and mice and is subject to X- linked compensatory mechanisms which limit the production of homozygous recessive conditional knockout mice. Zebrafish do not have sex chromosomes and therefore represent a unique and powerful system in which to understand the function of in HCFC1. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are 1) to determine the function of HCFC1 in neural precursor specification, proliferation, and differentiation in vivo and 2) to determine whether HCFC1 regulates brain development by modulating the expression of the MMACHC gene. The results of these data will help to identify novel pathways and therapeutic targets for neurological disorders associated with defects in neural precursor function. Project Narrative Mutations in the HCFC1 gene have been found in patients with multiple congenital anomalies suffering from debilitating neurological impairment and intellectual disability. However, there is a clear gap in our understanding of how mutation of HCFC1 can cause disease. The work proposed here will use zebrafish as a model system to understand how HCFC1 regulates both normal development and disease.",Mutations in HCFC1 alter neural precursor

"Primary-Care Based Mindfulness Intervention for Chronically Traumatized Individuals Project Summary/Abstract Rates of repeated exposure to trauma and levels of trauma-related psychiatric disorders in low-income, urban minority communities far exceed national averages. Despite this, inadequate access and substantial barriers to treatment in urban traumatized populations remain. Mindfulness-based interventions may target emotion dysregulation and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, mechanisms that contribute to trauma-related psychiatric outcomes like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In line with the strategic goals of the NCCIH to improve care for hard-to-manage symptoms, the purpose of this study is to pilot a primary-care based mindfulness intervention for chronically traumatized African Americans screening positive for PTSD and MDD in primary care clinics within an urban public hospital. The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design along with a multi-method psychological and physiological assessment approach to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a [mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention for primary care (MBCT)] versus wait-list control in African Americans with chronic trauma exposure and comorbid PTSD and MDD. Also in line with the strategic goal of NCCIH to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mind-body intervention approaches, preliminary mechanisms of action and change in outcomes associated with MBCT including emotion dysregulation, autonomic function, and PTSD and MDD symptoms will be evaluated. The data collection and [8-session] group intervention will take place in primary care clinics within an urban public hospital serving primarily low-income, minority individuals (>80% African American). Training activities will take place in an academic medical setting under the umbrella of a broader project aimed at understanding psychological and biological risk factors for PTSD. Training goals for this K23 project include 1) learning how to design, implement, and evaluate the outcomes of complementary and integrative behavioral health interventions, 2) [gaining enhanced training in mindfulness and integrated care], 3) learning longitudinal data analytic techniques, and 4) gathering and analyzing psychophysiological variables and integrating psychophysiological data into treatment research. Ultimately, career goals for the applicant include working to improve treatment for underserved civilian trauma populations in urban settings by taking a complementary integrative health perspective and enhance understanding of mechanisms of change in the context of trauma-related treatment. Bringing measures of objective physiological markers like autonomic function into primary care settings in the context of behavioral health treatments will also aid in our understanding of the biological mechanisms that may change as a result of these treatments and how those underlying biological mechanisms can positively impact health outcomes long term. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans living in low-income, urban communities are at risk for repeated exposure to trauma and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, yet there remains inadequate access and substantial barriers to treatment for this at-risk population. This proposal will investigate the initial feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary mechanisms of action and outcomes of a mindfulness-based intervention in primary care for African Americans with chronic trauma exposure and PTSD and depression symptoms, with the goal of improving treatment for underserved civilian trauma populations in urban settings and enhancing understanding of mechanisms

"Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions Over 25% of the adult population in the United States suffers from multiple chronic conditions (MCC), with numbers rising, especially among Black men and women who experience the highest MCC morbidity. Those with MCC often experience symptoms or symptom clusters that undermine their quality of life and ability to self-manage. Importantly, symptom severity in those with even the same MCC varies, suggesting that the mechanisms driving symptoms in MCC are not fixed but vary in ways that may make them amenable to targeted interventions – the very essence of nursing science. The over-arching goal of the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” is to strengthen the capacities of a diverse faculty of nurse scientists to conduct innovative translational research using cutting-edge metabolomics and microbiomic technologies to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC. The Center’s research aim is to apply next-generation metabolomics technology and data analytic strategies to stimulate discovery of the metabolites and metabolic pathways that are present in individuals with MCC, focusing on the metabolites and metabolic pathways that synergize across conditions and associate with severe symptoms of fatigue, depression, or anxiety and their cluster, but are less represented in individuals with MCC who have minimal or no symptoms. Metabolites and pathways associated with symptoms will be evaluated in light of covariates such as sex as a biological variable, age, stress and discrimination, diet and medications. An exploratory aim will investigate the composition of the gut microbiome as a potential covariate to these symptoms. This aim takes advantage of our School’s strength in microbiome research and evidence linking the microbiome to these symptoms. Pilots 1-3 will examine the circulating metabolites and metabolic profiles that associate with the severity of the symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety in individuals with MCC and in light of covariates, and examine the associations at each time point, while pilot 4 will apply data analytic techniques to model the complex pathways associated with symptom severity, synergy, cluster, and health quality outcomes in MCC. Pilot 5 will test the Pilot 4 model for proof of concept that the metabolites and covariates identified in Pilots 1-3 do associate with symptom severity and are valid targets for intervention. Metabolites associated with symptoms in MCC, including those that synergize, that contribute to clustering, or are microbiome-associated, have yet to be described. Of the 26 Center Personnel, 18 are Center Faculty and Members. Our research base in MCC, self-management, metabolomics, and the microbiome is strong with annual direct costs of $4.7 million. The Center for Data Science is supported with ½ million dollars annually, and will provide infrastructure to the Data Science Core. We will leverage resources of the Emory Metabolomics and Integrated Genomic Cores. Equipping junior faculty to consider complex theories and employ cutting-edge technology, while focused on translation, prepares future nurse scientists to address issues that matter to patients and families. Center Project Narrative The number of individuals living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is rising world-wide, with Black men and women most often negatively affected in the United States. Through the work of its Administrative, Pilot, Enrichment, and Data Science Cores, the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” will strengthen the capacity of junior nurse faculty to make use of sophisticated metabolomic and microbiome technologies and cutting-edge data analytic strategies to conduct innovative translational research to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC, improving public health for generations to come.","Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions",9606863,P30NR018090,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' nursing intervention ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' microbiome ', ' health related quality of life ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' gut microbiome ', ' metabolic profile ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom science ', ' symptom cluster ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' dysbiotic ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiosis ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2018,542332,0.10300435055404167
"Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly reduces the risk of hospitalizations, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increases quality of life. Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience.

"A Brief, Peer Co-Led, Group-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Sexual Minority Young Adult Men Project Summary/Abstract Eating disorders are resistant to treatment and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, efficacious and efficient eating disorder prevention programs are greatly needed. There has been a longstanding belief among the general public, and clinicians, that eating disorders are nearly an exclusively female problem. However, extant literature has found that males also experience eating disorders, constituting up to 40% of individuals with diagnostic/sub-threshold eating pathology. Among males, sexual minorities (i.e., gay, bisexual, and non-heterosexual identified individuals) are a salient subgroup that is at substantial risk for developing eating disorders. Indeed, sexual minority males are not only at elevated risk compared to heterosexual males, but are also at elevated risk compared to heterosexual females. The lifetime prevalence for any eating disorder diagnosis among sexual minority males is 8.8%, and subclinical diagnosis is 15.6%. This is in contrast to heterosexual females, in which the prevalence for clinical and subclinical diagnoses are at 4.8% and 8.0%, respectively. These findings indicate that sexual minority males may well be one of the most vulnerable groups in regard to eating pathology risk. To date, there is a paucity of research on eating disorder prevention programs among sexual minority males. We are only aware of one previous prevention program targeting sexual minority males. This program, the PRIDE Body Project, developed and tested by our research team, is a two-session, peer co-led, group, cognitive dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program, based on existing eating disorder prevention programs developed with females. In our preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT), we found significant and large effects on eating pathology and relevant eating disorder risk factors, compared to a waitlist control condition, at post-treatment and 4-weeks post-treatment. Additionally, preliminary mediation analyses revealed that internalization of the appearance ideal and body dissatisfaction accounted for significant variance in the relationship between treatment condition and eating pathology. These results represent an important first step in demonstrating the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a brief, peer-led eating disorder prevention program for sexual minority males. Despite these initial findings, future research is needed to further test this promising intervention. Specifically, it is not known if the PRIDE Body Project will exert a clinically and statistically significant effect in comparison to a time and attention matched control condition. Additionally, it is unknown if the intervention effects will persist beyond 4-weeks post intervention. With these limitations in mind, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial assessing the PRIDE Body Project to a time and attention-matched active control condition, and follow participants for 24 months. Additionally, we plan to assess potential mediators (body dissatisfaction and internalization of the appearance ideal) of the treatment effect on eating disorder symptoms. Narrative Sexual minority men are one of the most vulnerable groups for developing eating disorders. However, limited data on targeted eating disorder prevention programs exist for this population. Thus, we seek to test the efficacy of a group based, peer co-led, eating disorder prevention program for sexual minority young adult men.","A Brief, Peer Co-Led, Group-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Sexual Minority Young Adult Men",9543556,R01MD012698,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' Bulimia ', ' bulimic ', ' Bulimia Nervosa ', ' Cognitive Dissonance ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Binge eating disorder ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Appearance ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Scheme ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' body dissatisfaction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' treatment effect ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' eating pathology ', ' sexual minority ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' nonheterosexual ', ' non-heterosexual ', ' ']",NIMHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,677278,0.0009493037847821817
"Effect of patient-provider sexual communication adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence, sexual dysfunction management, and sexual quality of life among Black women with breast cancer For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly reduces the risk of hospitalizations, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increases quality of life. Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience. Our study will test use of a web-enabled app with tailored feedback that is integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record. This app is designed to improve patient-provider communication about adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits among diverse patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We will evaluate the intervention on a comprehensive set of outcomes, including rigorous measures of long-term adherence, quality of life, and costs.","Effect of patient-provider sexual communication adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence, sexual dysfunction management, and sexual quality of life among Black women with breast cancer",9605475,R01CA218155,"['malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' mortality ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tablets ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Time Management ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Adjuvant ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' web-enabled ', ' chemotherapy ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' three-arm study ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' real time monitoring ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2018,32420,0.020842170166471146
"Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) Pragmatic Clinical Trial Cancer and its treatment engender disabling symptoms that are frequently undertreated, and associated with needlessly increased healthcare utilization, non-adherence to oncologic treatments, and reduced survival. The key to addressing this damaging situation lies in reliably detecting symptoms and providing evidence-based care. Of note, the National Academy of Medicine has identified systematic screening with patient reported outcomes (PROs) as critical, not only to symptom control, but also to enhancing the patient centricity and effectiveness of cancer care in general. Unfortunately, experience has shown that simply presenting PRO data to over-loaded, treatment-focused clinicians has minimal or no impact on the outcomes of patients with many diseases, including cancer. On the other hand, providing these data to mid-level providers and entrusting them to initiate, monitor and adapt individually tailored symptom management plans has proven robustly effective in the control of cancer-related and other symptoms. However, the high resource requirements of this approach have heretofore limited its dissemination and scalability. Encouragingly, such resource intense care is not always required for meaningfully benefit, as attested by the effectiveness of interventions that provide patients experiencing mild or moderate with self-management education. This application recognizes the need for both low- and high-touch approaches to cancer symptom control and proposes the Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) pragmatic clinical trial to test a bundled intervention that leverages EHR interface and clinical decision support functionalities to operationalize the population-level implementation of an approach that automatically triages symptomatic patients to low-touch automated self-management (Level 1), or high-touch nurse care management (Level 2), both validated, depending on PRO scores, as well as patient and clinical factors. The E2C2 intervention will target Sleep disturbance, Pain, Anxiety, Depression, and Energy deficit/fatigue, the SPADE pentad which represents the most prevalent and potentially treatable group of overlapping cancer symptoms. To rigorously assess the effectiveness of discrete E2C2 intervention components, we will initially test a Stage 1 Symptom Control Bundle for 12 months, after which we will add a Stage 2 Implementation Bundle. The trial's stepped wedge design will randomize the order of E2C2 implementation among 21 clusters. Clusters will be defined at the level of the cancer care team, and will be randomized to one of five different tranches to receive the intervention at staggered 6 month intervals. Outcomes will include SPADE symptom scores (primary), physical function, social participation, quality of life, distress, healthcare utilization, adherence to cancer treatment, and vital status which will be collected for 9-12 months during each trial phase; pre-E2C2, Stage 1 and Stage 2. A multi-stakeholder, mixed methods approach will be used to comprehensively assess the impact of the Stage 2 Implementation Bundle, as well as both Stages' impact on rurally-based and elderly patients, groups prone to disparities in symptom control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) pragmatic clinical trial will test the population- level implementation of validated approaches to detect and effectively manage sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, depression, and energy deficit/fatigue among patients with all types and stages of cancer. The trial is important because it will rigorously test a means of deploying finite resources to yield maximal patient benefit in lessened symptom burden and functional loss, as well as enhanced survival and quality of life.","Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) Pragmatic Clinical Trial",9625964,UM1CA233033,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Logic ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Generations ', ' Nursing Care Management ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Process Measure ', ' Self Management ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' behavioral pharmacology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Vital Status ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' systematic review ', ' virtual ', ' Information Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' collaborative care ', ' implementation science ', ' functional loss ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' screening ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' improved outcome ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' debilitating symptom ', ' disabling symptom ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' rural dwelling ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,UM1,2018,8698201,0.07231420020404383
"Quality of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in Medicaid-enrollees: The Effects of State Policies and Intiatives Project Summary Opioid use disorders are a significant public health crisis, and medication treatment is the most effective intervention for individuals with opioid use disorder. State policies and initiatives have increased medication treatment utilization over the last decade, but increased utilization without attention to quality of care might limit the public health benefits of medication treatment. Many states have begun implementing policies and initiatives to improve quality, although with little empirical support of their effectiveness in real world settings. This project will characterize how quality care for Medicaid-enrollees receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder and related health outcomes have changed over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations. We will then examine the extent to which policies and initiatives that increase access and those aimed at improving quality are associated with better quality of care and related health outcomes, overall, and for historically underserved and high-risk populations Project Narrative This project will characterize how medication treatment (MT) use, quality, and related health outcomes for Medicaid-enrollees with opioid use disorders has changed over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations.

"Psychoneurological Symptoms in Situationally Stressed Low Income Mothers Project Summary/Abstract  In the United States, more than 10% of mothers, or 8.5 million, live in poverty, placing the mothers in conditions of chronic situational stress. Low income mothers are exposed to chronic situational stress, due in part to the economic hardship and additional stressors associated with the responsibilities of motherhood. Exposure to economic hardship is associated with higher reports of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and cognitive dysfunction, known as the psychoneurological symptoms. These symptoms can significantly impair a mother by interfering with her ability to function and mother. Compromises to a mother's functioning places her children at higher lifetime risks of impaired cognitive and emotional development; infants and toddlers are the most vulnerable to these consequences. To date, attempts to intervene on situational stress-related symptoms in low income mothers have focused on depressive symptoms. These interventions have met with varied levels of efficacy. The limited efficacy may be because interventions addressing depressive symptoms do not include pain, which is experienced by 50% of low income mothers. An alternative and novel approach is to reconceptualize the stress-related symptoms as psychoneurological symptoms in order to consider underlying biological mechanisms that could be targeted by interventions.  The proposed study will describe psychoneurological symptoms in a sample of low income mothers under chronic situational stress and determine the associations of the symptoms with situational stress and with maternal and child outcomes. This study will be a secondary analysis of data from 356 low income mothers and will combine the data from two parent studies conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The proposed study will analyze key variables of situational stress, psychoneurological symptoms, maternal functioning, and child behavior and development. The project has three aims: to describe the intensity of the psychoneurological symptoms by comparing a simple, data-naïve approach (composite score) against a complex, innovative data-driven approach (reduced rank regression); to use multiple regression analyses to explore how variations in levels of chronic situational stress are associated with intensity of psychoneurological symptoms; and to use multiple regression analyses to determine the relationship of psychoneurological symptoms to mother's functional status (physical functioning, social functioning, role functioning, mothering) and child behavioral and developmental status.  This study addresses NINR's Innovative Questions in Symptom Science concerning the impact of adverse symptoms across diverse populations by researching the behavioral dynamics of symptoms (1-1) and how lifestyle factors and environmental conditions impact symptoms (1-3). The findings from this study will be the first step towards determining personalized biomarkers of psychoneurological symptoms and, eventually, developing targeted symptom management interventions to improve quality of life for the mothers. Project Narrative This project will link symptoms (pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and cognitive dysfunction) that are often experienced by low income mothers to the high levels of stress in their lives and describe the impact of those symptoms on their functioning and the health of their children. Positive outcomes of the project will support future identification of what causes these symptoms biologically and, ultimately, lead to the development of strategies to help low income mothers better manage their symptoms.  ",Psychoneurological Symptoms in Situationally Stressed Low Income Mothers,9548909,F31NR017106,"['Behavioral Research ', ' Breast ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Neurosciences ', ' North Carolina ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' chronic pain ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' motherhood ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' functional status ', ' monoamine ', ' skills ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' member ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' disturbance in affect ', ' mood dysfunction ', ' mood disturbance ', ' mood and affect disturbance ', ' mood alteration ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Subgroup ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' Social Functioning ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' improved outcome ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom science ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NINR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2018,33908,0.0670835076927576
"Exploring minorities The Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site of Miami PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in science and technology are now making tackling of rare and undiagnosed disorders possible. By utilizing these advances, along with scientific and clinical expertise, the Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) promises improvement in the lives of individuals and their families affected with undiagnosed disorders. To benefit from this effort, the nation as a whole, especially the rich and rapidly increasing diversity of the US population must be taken into account. With its longstanding excellence in clinical care and research in South Florida, University of Miami is in an unsurpassed position to be a part of the UDN. We propose to create the Clinical Site-Miami (CS-Miami), which will recruit, evaluate, and provide data from participants with undiagnosed disorders. While we will be open to all participants from any location, we will specifically focus on South Florida. The diverse population of South Florida includes Hispanics from the Caribbean (e.g. Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic), Mexico, South and Central America, Caribbean born blacks, Jews and others from all over the world. Many of these minorities are recent immigrants whose original populations are ideal for the occurrence of rare diseases due to isolation, inbreeding, and founder effects. Our Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) is the only member of the national CTSA consortium co-funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) to specifically focus on the health of underrepresented minorities. To represent the minority populations, we are one of the recruitment sites for NIH`s AllofUs Precision Medicine Initiative, again, with a focus of enrolling >50% of minority participants. We will build CS-Miami upon existing expertise in community engagement, electronic medical records, biorepositories, phenotypic delineation of rare diseases, characterization of their underlying biology, and access to a large collaboration network.

"Lifecourse cardiovascular risk, depression and cognition in black & white adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive function and depressive symptoms share many cardiovascular origins and their prevalence increases dramatically with age. Emerging evidence suggests that the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes progresses over the life course and may be different in older adults compared to middle-aged and younger adults. Racial disparities in cardiovascular risk factors and the age at which they develop may further exacerbate these associations. This 5-year K01 award application seeks to improve our knowledge of the influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive function and depressive symptoms over the life course in black and white adults. Additionally, this proposal will elucidate the role of cardiovascular risk factors with underlying structural brain changes over the life course. This proposal involves analyses of two large biracial epidemiologic cohorts: including 1) the ongoing CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study of 5,115 young adult to middle-aged men and women (52% blacks and 48% whites), and 2) the ongoing Health ABC (Health, Aging and Body Composition) study of 3,075 older adult men and women (42% blacks and 58% whites). We hypothesize that greater exposure to non-optimal cardiovascular measures will be associated with worse cognitive function, greater number of depressive symptoms, and worse structural brain indices such as greater white matter lesions and hippocampal atrophy across the life course in blacks and whites. The data structure of the cohorts will enable us to evaluate several life course epidemiologic models such as early vs. late life cardiovascular exposure, with the possibility of evaluating sensitive periods. This life course approach is mirrored in the scientifi aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, we will determine how young adulthood and midlife cardiovascular exposure (CARDIA) and late life cardiovascular exposure (Health ABC) influence trajectories of depressive symptoms. In Aims 2 and 3, we will determine how young adulthood cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive performance and structural brain integrity at midlife (CARDIA) and how late life cardiovascular exposure influences cognitive decline and structural brain integrity in late life (Health ABC). The proposed analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan that will (1) advance my conceptual training in the clinical aspect of cognition and depressive symptoms outcomes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular aspects in particular; (2) train me in neuroimaging and markers of structural brain integrity; and (3) advance my methodologic training in longitudinal and neuroimaging related statistical methods and my knowledge of life course models. My training plan will include formal courses, clinical assessment and grand rounds, attendance at scholarly seminars, directed readings and professional development activities specifically tailored to my training goals. Having the K01 support will result in preliminary data and the mentoring necessary to establish myself more strongly as an independent investigator and promote the development of a successful R01 application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The influence of cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive function and depressive symptoms progresses over the life course and may be different in older adults compared to younger adults, with evidence of racial disparity in these associations. This study will address the life course nature of the associations of cardiovascular risk factors with cognitive function and depressive symptoms in black and white adults, and additionally the role of structural brain changes in these associations.","Lifecourse cardiovascular risk, depression and cognition in black & white adults",9458664,K01AG047273,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Body Composition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cognition ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' indexing ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropathology ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' feeding ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' hippocampal atropy ', ' hippocampal atrophy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' data structure ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' cognitive performance ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' biracial ', ' common symptom ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2018,122364,0.004443592554495501
"Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly reduces the risk of hospitalizations, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increases quality of life. Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience. Our study will test use of a web-enabled app with tailored feedback that is integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record. This app is designed to improve patient-provider communication about adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits among diverse patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer.

"Developing a Pediatrics-based Social Needs Intervention to Reduce Disparities in ADHD Outcomes for Low-income Children PROJECT SUMMARY. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic conditions in childhood, with significantly higher rates and worse outcomes among socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Social adversities including unmet basic needs such as food insecurity, housing instability, and lack of quality child care emerge as potent risk factors for ADHD symptoms as early as the preschool years. The development of early intervention strategies for young children with both ADHD and socioeconomic disadvantage is critical for mitigating future impairment. New research demonstrates that a low intensity, family-centered screening and referral program (WE CARE) at well infant visits is feasible and can increase receipt of resources for unmet social needs (e.g. food, transportation, and parent education). Adapting this strategy to target preschoolers with emerging ADHD, who are typically first identified in primary care, could significantly impact clinical symptoms and disease trajectory during a critical developmental period. Therefore, the objective of this project is develop an early intervention strategy, adapted from the WE CARE program, targeting unmet social needs for low-income families of preschool-age children with emerging ADHD. The WE CARE intervention will be adapted on 3 key domains (for a new target population, content, and primary outcomes) through the pursuit of 3 interrelated studies. These are: 1) Examine the association between specific unmet social needs and ADHD symptoms in 7,565 nationally representative children age 3-5 from the National Survey for Children's Health (NSCH) and explore potential mediators of this association (including parental stress, activation, and unmet need for care) via structural equation modeling (SEM); 2) Identify parent-reported mechanisms by which unmet social needs exacerbate ADHD symptoms in preschool age children and how an intervention addressing these needs could improve clinical outcomes by conducting semi-structured interviews with 25 parents of preschoolers with ADHD symptoms; and 3) Conduct an adaptive, randomized pilot trial of a novel treatment model addressing unmet social needs with parents of 60 low-income children age 3-5 with ADHD symptoms. This research plan reflects Objective 3.2 of the NIMH Strategic Plan, to develop ways to tailor existing and new interventions to optimize outcomes, and addresses an urgent need to reduce socioeconomic disparities in pediatric mental health outcomes by targeting modifiable risk factors in vulnerable young children. These research aims will also serve as vehicles for pragmatic learning of the following training goals: 1) Learn advanced statistical modeling and measurement methods for social determinants research; 2) Gain expertise in intervention development to reduce mental health disparities; and 3) Obtain training in modern clinical trial design for the study of psychosocial and health services interventions. This mentored K23 award will facilitate Dr. Spencer's long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator developing novel interventions to reduce socioeconomic inequities in pediatric psychiatric outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE ADHD is one of the most common chronic illnesses in childhood, with a general prevalence of 5-10%, and disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Preschool ADHD onset is associated with worse illness and treatment-emergent side effects, and socioeconomic adversity increases the likelihood of treatment non-response and future morbidity in young children.

"mHealth for Heart Failure Symptom Monitoring ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding better ways to engage patients with heart failure (HF) in symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers. Symptoms are the main driver of health- related outcomes for patients with HF and the primary driver of repeated hospital readmissions. Given that we are located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, a predominantly poor Latino community, we are uniquely positioned to address the health disparity in clinical outcomes for Latino patients with HF as well as others with HF using a mobile health (mHealth) application (app). The proposed long-term goal of this NIH K99/R00 application is to assist the candidate, Dr. Masterson Creber, in becoming an independent investigator with a program of research focusing on high quality, technology-based behavioral health interventions to improve outcomes and support patient-centered cardiovascular care for underserved patients with HF. The overall objective of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that a novel app, mi.Symptoms can meaningfully alter patient-reported and clinical outcomes of patients with HF and lead to more successful symptom recognition, response and communication with healthcare providers. The central hypothesis is that empowering patients to take more control of their symptom experience using a technology-enabled point-of-care symptom reporting intervention (mi.Symptoms) can meaningfully alter symptom response behaviors the clinical outcomes of patients with HF. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in the K99 phase of the study by pursing the following specific aims: 1) test the reliability and validity of mi.Symptoms (a novel mHealth app developed by Dr. Masterson Creber and a team from Columbia University School of Engineering), and 2) assess the usability of mi.Symptoms and examine relationships of its use with changes in patient-reported outcomes in a pilot feasibility study. In the R00 phase of the study, the specific aim is to: 3) examine the efficacy o mi.Symptoms on improving patient-reported and clinical outcomes as compared to usual care. The training plan for this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will enable Dr. Masterson Creber to couple skills in biomedical informatics with clinical trial design and outcomes research. The approach has three innovative features: 1) it is grounded in the Theory of Situation Awareness in Dynamic Systems; 2) there is a close link between the theoretical model and unique functional elements of the mi.Symptoms web app (tailoring to patient preference by choosing an avatar, prompting to report symptoms, reinforcing symptom reporting with hedonic motivation, and decreasing barriers to facilitate communication with providers); and 3) it applies growth modeling to the analysis of multiple symptoms and outcomes over time. Findings from this study will provide insights into the development and testing of mi.Symptoms as well as many other mHealth apps. The research is significant because it addresses the important problem of patients with HF struggling to recognize and respond to their symptoms, and it addresses the health disparity in HF outcomes for Latino patients. To accomplish the aims of this proposed study, a robust mentorship team with internationally and nationally recognized experts has been built, including expertise in biomedical informatics with a focus on mHealth (Dr. Suzanne Bakken), cardiovascular behavioral health and clinical trial design (Dr. Karina Davidson), user-centered design (Dr. Steven Feiner), clinical heart failure management (Dr. Mathew Maurer), symptom monitoring (Dr. Kathleen Hickey), quantitative methodologies (Dr. Christopher Lee), and mHealth application development and testing (Dr. Cornelia Ruland). Since a spectrum of new knowledge and skills regarding biomedical informatics, computer science and user-interfaces, and behavioral health clinical trial design are required for the candidate's career as an independent scientist, this K99/R00 award will be extremely important and necessary to achieve the candidate's career objectives and expand symptom science and the science of self- management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because providing patients with heart failure with an accessible mobile Health application to support symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers may improve patient-reported and clinical outcomes for heart failure and reduce health disparities among Latinos. The proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINR's mission that pertains to improving symptom science and self-management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases.",mHealth for Heart

"A framework enabling the genomic analysis of psychiatric traits across admixed populations. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Globally, neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading cause of disability. Despite recent advances in mental health genetics in Eurasian groups, major limitations remain in the understanding of psychiatric disorders in minority populations, in particular “admixed” groups of mixed ancestry. Due to the paucity of methodological approaches that account for their additional genomic complexity, admixed populations are systematically excluded from psychiatric genomic studies. Admixed populations, including African American and Latino individuals, make up more than a third of the US populace and have higher rates of some anxiety disorders including PTSD, yet these groups face severe disparities in mental health research and treatment due to being so sorely underrepresented in psychiatric genomics. To reap full and equitable benefits from efforts including All of Us, NeuroGAP, and the PGC, there is a pressing unmet need for the development of tools permitting the study of psychiatric traits in admixed peoples.  The candidate proposes to address this issue by developing a suite of statistical methods, software packages, and analytical resources. Dr. Atkinson will: 1a) build a tool to allow for the integration of admixed individuals into psychiatric GWAS; 1b) aggregate a significantly expanded Native American reference panel to improve genomic inference in admixed American populations; 2a) characterize the genetic basis of traits relevant to psychiatric disorders in diverse populations of the largest biobank dataset; 2b) leverage the linkage disequilibrium in admixed individuals to improve fine-mapping; and 3) develop a statistical method that generates reliable genetic risk scores for psychiatric traits in admixed subjects. These efforts fill a major gap in existing resources and will improve our understanding of psychiatric diseases in diverse groups whom medical genomics has so far failed. These efforts are in direct line with the strategic mission of the NIMH, highlighting the crucial and timely nature of the proposed project.  The proposed research and training plan were carefully designed to confer expertise in three domains: 1) phenotypes and genetic architectures of psychiatric disorders, 2) statistical methods development, and 3) professional development. These skills are fundamental to the candidate’s goal of becoming a leading investigator who develops and applies statistical genomics to understand psychiatric disorders across diverse populations. In addition to research training, Dr. Atkinson will take coursework, participate in regular seminars, attend workshops and conferences, and gain mentorship and teaching experience locally and in Africa. All research will be conducted in the Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, the Broad Institute, and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health with mentorship from renowned scientists Drs. Mark Daly and Karestan Koenen. Additional guidance from leading experts Drs. Ben Neale, Alkes Price, and Jordan Smoller will ensure exceptional guidance and support. Overall, the training environment is outstanding, the mentors and advisors are world-class, the proposed studies address an urgent unmet need, and the additional skills gained in this award will poise Dr. Atkinson to establish independent leadership in population, statistical, and psychiatric genomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders are the leading global cause of years lived with disability and affect all societies, yet there are major disparities in mental health research and treatment across ancestry groups. Specifically, “admixed” people – those whose DNA contains more than one ancestral component, including African American and Latino individuals – are systemically excluded from studies due to the lack of available methods to appropriately handle their complex genomes. In this award, I propose to bridge this concerning gap in research space by developing novel methods and tools to enable the study of complex psychiatric traits in admixed people, bettering our understanding of mental health genetics in these diverse populations who have so far been underserved.",A framework enabling the genomic analysis of psychiatric traits across admixed populations.,9871338,K01MH121659,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Americas ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Data Collection ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Jordan ', ' Leadership ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' years lived with disability ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' tool development ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' translational genetics ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' population stratification ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2019,185179,-0.0015296394332818576
"Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly reduces the risk of hospitalizations, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increases quality of life. Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience. Our study will test use of a web-enabled app with tailored feedback that is integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record. This app is designed to improve patient-provider communication about adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits among diverse patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We will evaluate the intervention on a comprehensive set of outcomes, including rigorous measures of long-term adherence, quality of life, and costs.",Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence,9830148,R01CA218155,"['malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' mortality ', ' physician office visit ', ' Office Visits ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tablets ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Time Management ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patient Noncompliance ', ' Patient Nonadherence ', ' Patient Non-Adherence ', ' Patient Non Compliance ', ' Nonadherent patient ', ' Non-adherent patient ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Adjuvant ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' web-enabled ', ' chemotherapy ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' three-arm study ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' side effect ', ' adherence rate ', ' ']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,24217,0.05086204994587611
"Mutations in HCFC1 alter neural precursor differentiation Project Summary My overarching scientific goal is to develop a cross disciplinary research program that utilizes zebrafish as a model organism to understand the molecular basis of developmental disorders. I am a tenure track assistant professor at The University of Texas El Paso (UTEP), a Hispanic serving institution, located on the US/Mexican border. UTEP is dedicated to addressing the emerging challenges of the border region and has developed the Border Biomedical Research Center (BBRC), a component of the National Institutes of Health Disparities Research Centers in Minority Institutions Program (RCMI) to expand biomedical research and strengthen the research infrastructure within the region. My research complements the goals of both UTEP and the BBRC, thus I am perfectly positioned to develop a successful cross disciplinary research program.  The goal of this K01 mentored career science award is “to provide a research intensive mentored experience, which will ultimately increase the candidate’s level of competitiveness for future R01 level funding.” To meet this goal, we propose a research intensive training plan, which focuses primarily on improving my publication record and providing high level training in grant writing by utilizing programs sponsored by the National Research Mentoring Network (NMRN) and the American Society for Cell Biology. We will complement these initiatives by enhancing my leadership skills and my professional network. Therefore, at the end of this award, I will have received expert training appropriate to my current position, which will improve my competitiveness for R-level funding.  The focus of the current proposal is understand the underlying mechanisms associated with mutations in the HCFC1 transcriptional cofactor. Mutations in HCFC1 cause cobalamin X disorder (cblX), a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome associated with severe neurological and neurodevelopmental deficits. In vitro studies suggest HCFC1 functions to modulate neural precursor differentiation, but these results have not been confirmed in vivo because HCFC1 is present on the X-chromosome in humans and mice and is subject to X- linked compensatory mechanisms which limit the production of homozygous recessive conditional knockout mice. Zebrafish do not have sex chromosomes and therefore represent a unique and powerful system in which to understand the function of in HCFC1. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are 1) to determine the function of HCFC1 in neural precursor specification, proliferation, and differentiation in vivo and 2) to determine whether HCFC1 regulates brain development by modulating the expression of the MMACHC gene. The results of these data will help to identify novel pathways and therapeutic targets for neurological disorders associated with defects in neural precursor function. Project Narrative Mutations in the HCFC1 gene have been found in patients with multiple congenital anomalies suffering from debilitating neurological impairment and intellectual disability. However, there is a clear gap in our understanding of how mutation of HCFC1 can cause disease. The work proposed here will use zebrafish as a model system to understand how HCFC1 regulates both normal development and disease.",Mutations in HCFC1 alter neural precursor

"Exploring minorities The Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site of Miami PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in science and technology are now making tackling of rare and undiagnosed disorders possible. By utilizing these advances, along with scientific and clinical expertise, the Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) promises improvement in the lives of individuals and their families affected with undiagnosed disorders. To benefit from this effort, the nation as a whole, especially the rich and rapidly increasing diversity of the US population must be taken into account. With its longstanding excellence in clinical care and research in South Florida, University of Miami is in an unsurpassed position to be a part of the UDN. We propose to create the Clinical Site-Miami (CS-Miami), which will recruit, evaluate, and provide data from participants with undiagnosed disorders. While we will be open to all participants from any location, we will specifically focus on South Florida. The diverse population of South Florida includes Hispanics from the Caribbean (e.g. Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic), Mexico, South and Central America, Caribbean born blacks, Jews and others from all over the world. Many of these minorities are recent immigrants whose original populations are ideal for the occurrence of rare diseases due to isolation, inbreeding, and founder effects. Our Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) is the only member of the national CTSA consortium co-funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) to specifically focus on the health of underrepresented minorities. To represent the minority populations, we are one of the recruitment sites for NIH`s AllofUs Precision Medicine Initiative, again, with a focus of enrolling >50% of minority participants. We will build CS-Miami upon existing expertise in community engagement, electronic medical records, biorepositories, phenotypic delineation of rare diseases, characterization of their underlying biology, and access to a large collaboration network. Specific aims will be to 1) recruitment, enroll, and engage minorities into CS-Miami; 2) characterize rare and undiagnosed disease phenotypes; 3) to reach a diagnosis via collaborative analysis of standard data. Our team's combined expertise in clinical assessment, patient engagement, informatics, ethics and genomics will provide the requisite oversight and structure to ensure we meet our stated goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to create the Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site-Miami (CS-Miami), which will evaluate and provide data from over 120 participants with various undiagnosed diseases. Our team's combined expertise in genetics and genomics, sensory disorders, development of robust biorepositories, outreach and ethics will help ensure that the required regulatory, governance and ethical approaches are developed and implemented at CS-Miami.",Exploring minorities The Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site of Miami,9789915,U01HG010230,"['Informatics ', ' Rare Diseases ', '

"Maternal Exposure to Childhood Abuse and Disparities in Offspring Neurodevelopment: Identifying Mechanisms Project Summary Children of women exposed to childhood abuse exhibit increased risk for a wide array of neurodevelopmental deficits, including elevated risk of anxiety, depression, and social problems. Our studies have found that these children had a more than three-fold higher risk of autism and 70% higher risk of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Animal studies similarly find that maternal exposure to stressors is associated with offspring anxiety, depressive symptoms, and attention problems and decreased social behavior. Neurodevelopmental disorders are common and carry lifelong, costly burdens. Yet, extant research has failed to identify pathways by which children of women abused are at risk of harm. Identification of such pathways is a critical step in preventing neurodevelopmental deficits in these children. The present research focuses on three likely pathways that have largely been unexamined. We will identify biological dysregulation during pregnancy in women exposed versus unexposed to abuse in two systems: hormonal function and immune function. Dysregulation in these biological systems is known to harm offspring neurodevelopment and is present in adults who have experienced childhood abuse, yet it is largely unknown whether dysregulation in these systems occurs during the pregnancies of women exposure to abuse. We will collect biological samples to measure the functioning of these systems in a large, prospective cohort of pregnant women. Second, we will examine whether women who experienced abuse carry higher genetic loading for neuropsychiatric disorders by calculating genetic risk scores for 5 disorders including autism and ADHD in more than 8000 women. Genetically informed studies indicate that genetic variation plays a role in increased risk of negative neurodevelopmental outcomes in children of women abused. However, to date no studies have used genome- wide data to address this question. Our proposed study is uniquely suited to greatly expand our understanding of how childhood abuse affects health across generations and to inform interventions to protect the healthy development of children. This information is critical to establish public health priorities and to determine the optimal type and timing of interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental harm to children. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance The proposed research will examine three biological pathways which may account for the association of maternal childhood abuse with offspring neurodevelopmental deficits: 1) endocrine dysfunction during pregnancy, 2) inflammation during pregnancy, and 3) genetic loading for neurodevelopmental disorders. Neurodevelomental deficits, including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are major causes of disability, morbidity, and unemployment across the life course. Ascertaining the mechanisms by which mother's abuse affects offspring neurodevelopment will have a profound impact on the design of public health interventions to protect the healthy development of children, specifically: 1) identify targets for potential prenatal and perinatal interventions, 2) improve screening in prenatal and pediatric care, and 3) identify children who will benefit from early intervention.",Maternal Exposure to Childhood Abuse and Disparities in Offspring Neurodevelopment: Identifying Mechanisms,9661451,R01HD094725,"['Adrenal Glands ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' endocrine gland/system ', ' Metabolic/Endocrine Body System ', ' Hormonal System ', ' Endocrine/Metabolic Organ System ', ' Endocrine system ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A Brief, Peer Co-Led, Group-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Sexual Minority Young Adult Men Project Summary/Abstract Eating disorders are resistant to treatment and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, efficacious and efficient eating disorder prevention programs are greatly needed. There has been a longstanding belief among the general public, and clinicians, that eating disorders are nearly an exclusively female problem. However, extant literature has found that males also experience eating disorders, constituting up to 40% of individuals with diagnostic/sub-threshold eating pathology. Among males, sexual minorities (i.e., gay, bisexual, and non-heterosexual identified individuals) are a salient subgroup that is at substantial risk for developing eating disorders. Indeed, sexual minority males are not only at elevated risk compared to heterosexual males, but are also at elevated risk compared to heterosexual females. The lifetime prevalence for any eating disorder diagnosis among sexual minority males is 8.8%, and subclinical diagnosis is 15.6%. This is in contrast to heterosexual females, in which the prevalence for clinical and subclinical diagnoses are at 4.8% and 8.0%, respectively. These findings indicate that sexual minority males may well be one of the most vulnerable groups in regard to eating pathology risk. To date, there is a paucity of research on eating disorder prevention programs among sexual minority males. We are only aware of one previous prevention program targeting sexual minority males. This program, the PRIDE Body Project, developed and tested by our research team, is a two-session, peer co-led, group, cognitive dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program, based on existing eating disorder prevention programs developed with females. In our preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT), we found significant and large effects on eating pathology and relevant eating disorder risk factors, compared to a waitlist control condition, at post-treatment and 4-weeks post-treatment. Additionally, preliminary mediation analyses revealed that internalization of the appearance ideal and body dissatisfaction accounted for significant variance in the relationship between treatment condition and eating pathology. These results represent an important first step in demonstrating the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a brief, peer-led eating disorder prevention program for sexual minority males. Despite these initial findings, future research is needed to further test this promising intervention. Specifically, it is not known if the PRIDE Body Project will exert a clinically and statistically significant effect in comparison to a time and attention matched control condition. Additionally, it is unknown if the intervention effects will persist beyond 4-weeks post intervention. With these limitations in mind, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial assessing the PRIDE Body Project to a time and attention-matched active control condition, and follow participants for 24 months. Additionally, we plan to assess potential mediators (body dissatisfaction and internalization of the appearance ideal) of the treatment effect on eating disorder symptoms. Narrative Sexual minority men are one of the most vulnerable groups for developing eating disorders. However, limited data on targeted eating disorder prevention programs exist for this population. Thus, we seek to test the efficacy of a group based, peer co-led, eating disorder prevention program for sexual minority young adult men.","A Brief, Peer Co-Led, Group-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Sexual Minority Young Adult Men",9690461,R01MD012698,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' Bulimia ', ' bulimic ', ' Bulimia Nervosa ', ' Cognitive Dissonance ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Gays ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Binge eating disorder ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Appearance ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Scheme ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' body dissatisfaction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' treatment effect ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' eating pathology ', ' sexual minority ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' non-heterosexual ', ' nonheterosexual ', ' ']",NIMHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,677278,0.0009493037847821817
"Symptom and Healthcare Access Reporting and Evaluation (SHARE) for Supportive Care Equity PROJECT ABSTRACT Cancer patients experience many troubling symptoms during treatment, including pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. However, symptom burden is not equally shared across racial/ethnic groups, with Black cancer patients reporting greater symptom burden than their White counterparts. Such disparities in symptom burden are particularly concerning as poorly managed symptoms contribute to lower health related quality of life and worse clinical outcomes. It is also well established, across multiple studies, that minorities report worse health care access (HCA) than Whites, leading to disparities in health care outcomes. However, understanding of the contribution of multiple, co-occurring HCA challenges to health care inequities is lacking, as is evidence on the contribution of HCA to symptom burden inequities. My long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in addressing inequities in supportive cancer care (i.e., care that optimizes comfort, function, and social support across the cancer care continuum) through the use of innovative health informatics tools that address systemic barriers to care. In collaboration with my mentoring team, I have developed a training and research plan to achieve my career goal. Specifically, I will acquire intensive training in 1) structural equation modeling approaches relevant to disentangling mediators of cancer care inequities; 2) health informatics integration in clinical practice; 3) the application of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in supportive cancer care; and 4) longitudinal intervention study design and evaluation. I will leverage my career development training to identify subgroups of cancer patients with similar HCA experiences, and examine the contribution of HCA to racial differences in symptom burden in a cohort of Black and White cancer patients enrolled in the North Carolina Health Registry Cancer Survivorship Cohort. With this understanding, I will then develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of an electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO) tool designed to routinely monitor both, symptoms and HCA in a cohort of Black and White cancer patients. Existing e-PRO tools rarely collect data on HCA and, to my knowledge, have not been evaluated in racially-diverse cancer patients, potentially leading to missed opportunities for identifying and addressing access-related challenges that might underlie or exacerbate disparities in symptom burden. The rationale for this project is that routinely monitoring symptoms and symptom- relevant HCA over time will lead to more timely and patient-centered symptom management, especially among Black cancer patients who report greater symptom burden and worse HCA relative to Whites. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses a serious and understudied gap in supportive cancer care: effective strategies for mitigating racial disparities in cancer-related symptom burden. Specifically, the proposed research will elucidate the contribution of health care access inequities to racial disparities in symptom burden in order to inform the development of a novel electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO) tool designed to routinely monitor symptoms and symptom-relevant health care access challenges. The proposed e-PRO tool has the potential to prompt more equitable provision of supportive care services and lead to improved cancer care outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities experiencing excess symptom burden and more barriers to care.",Symptom and Healthcare Access Reporting and Evaluation (SHARE) for Supportive Care Equity,9666889,K01CA218473,"['Anxiety ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' North Carolina ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Summary Reports ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sleeplessness ', ' Insomnia Disorder ', ' Insomnia ', ' Documentation ', ' cancer care ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' active method ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' clinical practice ', ' health data ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' Wait Time ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' informatics\xa0tool ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2019,160251,0.09210891819233859
"Quality of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in Medicaid-enrollees: The Effects of State Policies and Intiatives Project Summary Opioid use disorders are a significant public health crisis, and medication treatment is the most effective intervention for individuals with opioid use disorder. State policies and initiatives have increased medication treatment utilization over the last decade, but increased utilization without attention to quality of care might limit the public health benefits of medication treatment. Many states have begun implementing policies and initiatives to improve quality, although with little empirical support of their effectiveness in real world settings. This project will characterize how quality care for Medicaid-enrollees receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder and related health outcomes have changed over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations. We will then examine the extent to which policies and initiatives that increase access and those aimed at improving quality are associated with better quality of care and related health outcomes, overall, and for historically underserved and high-risk populations Project Narrative This project will characterize how medication treatment (MT) use, quality, and related health outcomes for Medicaid-enrollees with opioid use disorders has changed over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations.

"mHealth for Heart Failure Symptom Monitoring ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding better ways to engage patients with heart failure (HF) in symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers. Symptoms are the main driver of health- related outcomes for patients with HF and the primary driver of repeated hospital readmissions. Given that we are located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, a predominantly poor Latino community, we are uniquely positioned to address the health disparity in clinical outcomes for Latino patients with HF as well as others with HF using a mobile health (mHealth) application (app). The proposed long-term goal of this NIH K99/R00 application is to assist the candidate, Dr. Masterson Creber, in becoming an independent investigator with a program of research focusing on high quality, technology-based behavioral health interventions to improve outcomes and support patient-centered cardiovascular care for underserved patients with HF. The overall objective of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that a novel app, mi.Symptoms can meaningfully alter patient-reported and clinical outcomes of patients with HF and lead to more successful symptom recognition, response and communication with healthcare providers. The central hypothesis is that empowering patients to take more control of their symptom experience using a technology-enabled point-of-care symptom reporting intervention (mi.Symptoms) can meaningfully alter symptom response behaviors the clinical outcomes of patients with HF. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in the K99 phase of the study by pursing the following specific aims: 1) test the reliability and validity of mi.Symptoms (a novel mHealth app developed by Dr. Masterson Creber and a team from Columbia University School of Engineering), and 2) assess the usability of mi.Symptoms and examine relationships of its use with changes in patient-reported outcomes in a pilot feasibility study. In the R00 phase of the study, the specific aim is to: 3) examine the efficacy o mi.Symptoms on improving patient-reported and clinical outcomes as compared to usual care. The training plan for this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will enable Dr. Masterson Creber to couple skills in biomedical informatics with clinical trial design and outcomes research. The approach has three innovative features: 1) it is grounded in the Theory of Situation Awareness in Dynamic Systems; 2) there is a close link between the theoretical model and unique functional elements of the mi.Symptoms web app (tailoring to patient preference by choosing an avatar, prompting to report symptoms, reinforcing symptom reporting with hedonic motivation, and decreasing barriers to facilitate communication with providers); and 3) it applies growth modeling to the analysis of multiple symptoms and outcomes over time. Findings from this study will provide insights into the development and testing of mi.Symptoms as well as many other mHealth apps. The research is significant because it addresses the important problem of patients with HF struggling to recognize and respond to their symptoms, and it addresses the health disparity in HF outcomes for Latino patients. To accomplish the aims of this proposed study, a robust mentorship team with internationally and nationally recognized experts has been built, including expertise in biomedical informatics with a focus on mHealth (Dr. Suzanne Bakken), cardiovascular behavioral health and clinical trial design (Dr. Karina Davidson), user-centered design (Dr. Steven Feiner), clinical heart failure management (Dr. Mathew Maurer), symptom monitoring (Dr. Kathleen Hickey), quantitative methodologies (Dr. Christopher Lee), and mHealth application development and testing (Dr. Cornelia Ruland). Since a spectrum of new knowledge and skills regarding biomedical informatics, computer science and user-interfaces, and behavioral health clinical trial design are required for the candidate's career as an independent scientist, this K99/R00 award will be extremely important and necessary to achieve the candidate's career objectives and expand symptom science and the science of self- management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because providing patients with heart failure with an accessible mobile Health application to support symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers may improve patient-reported and clinical outcomes for heart failure and reduce health disparities among Latinos. The proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINR's mission that pertains to improving symptom science and self-management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases.",mHealth for Heart

"Primary-Care Based Mindfulness Intervention for Chronically Traumatized Individuals Project Summary/Abstract Rates of repeated exposure to trauma and levels of trauma-related psychiatric disorders in low-income, urban minority communities far exceed national averages. Despite this, inadequate access and substantial barriers to treatment in urban traumatized populations remain. Mindfulness-based interventions may target emotion dysregulation and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, mechanisms that contribute to trauma-related psychiatric outcomes like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In line with the strategic goals of the NCCIH to improve care for hard-to-manage symptoms, the purpose of this study is to pilot a primary-care based mindfulness intervention for chronically traumatized African Americans screening positive for PTSD and MDD in primary care clinics within an urban public hospital. The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design along with a multi-method psychological and physiological assessment approach to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a [mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention for primary care (MBCT)] versus wait-list control in African Americans with chronic trauma exposure and comorbid PTSD and MDD. Also in line with the strategic goal of NCCIH to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mind-body intervention approaches, preliminary mechanisms of action and change in outcomes associated with MBCT including emotion dysregulation, autonomic function, and PTSD and MDD symptoms will be evaluated. The data collection and [8-session] group intervention will take place in primary care clinics within an urban public hospital serving primarily low-income, minority individuals (>80% African American). Training activities will take place in an academic medical setting under the umbrella of a broader project aimed at understanding psychological and biological risk factors for PTSD. Training goals for this K23 project include 1) learning how to design, implement, and evaluate the outcomes of complementary and integrative behavioral health interventions, 2) [gaining enhanced training in mindfulness and integrated care], 3) learning longitudinal data analytic techniques, and 4) gathering and analyzing psychophysiological variables and integrating psychophysiological data into treatment research. Ultimately, career goals for the applicant include working to improve treatment for underserved civilian trauma populations in urban settings by taking a complementary integrative health perspective and enhance understanding of mechanisms of change in the context of trauma-related treatment. Bringing measures of objective physiological markers like autonomic function into primary care settings in the context of behavioral health treatments will also aid in our understanding of the biological mechanisms that may change as a result of these treatments and how those underlying biological mechanisms can positively impact health outcomes long term. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans living in low-income, urban communities are at risk for repeated exposure to trauma and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, yet there remains inadequate access and substantial barriers to treatment for this at-risk population. This proposal will investigate the initial feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary mechanisms of action and outcomes of a mindfulness-based intervention in primary care for African Americans with chronic trauma exposure and PTSD and depression symptoms, with the goal of improving treatment for underserved civilian trauma populations in urban settings and enhancing understanding of mechanisms

"The Relationship of Stressors in Health Care to Emotional and Physical Symptoms Experienced by Marginalized People Project Summary People who are gender minority (GM; people whose gender is incongruent with the sex that was assigned to them at birth) experience significantly higher rates of disability, chronic disease, and poor mental health as well as higher mortality than cisgender individuals (people whose gender is congruent with the sex they were assigned at birth). These health disparities have been linked to chronic stress associated with multiple stressors they encounter. There is evidence from qualitative studies that interactions with the health care environment may be a major source of stress that affects GM people’s willingness to seek care. However, little is known about the relationship between the stressors in health care and the symptoms of emotional distress or impaired physical functioning experienced by GM individuals or whether some gender identity groups may be more negatively affected by stressors in health care than others. In addition, few psychometrically sound measures are available to conduct such studies. The purpose of this study is to address these gaps in knowledge. Data from the 2015 United States Transgender Survey (USTS) will be analyzed to identify factors that may underlie stressors in health care interactions for GM people and whether survey items related to these stressors constitute a valid and reliable index for future use in GM research. These items have not been tested as a group for validity and reliability. Additionally, this research will examine relationships that may exist between stressors in health care interactions and symptoms of both emotional distress and impaired physical functioning among people who are GM. Emotional distress is measured with Kessler’s Psychological Distress Scale. Items to assess physical functioning are adapted from CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health Interview Survey. Symptom Management Theory will inform the study. Aim 1: Identify key factors that may underlie stressors in health care interactions, by evaluating USTS stressor items for factor structure and internal consistency. Aim 2: Determine the relationship between exposure to stressors in health care interactions and symptoms experienced by GM people (emotional distress and impaired physical functioning), after controlling for socioeconomic factors (e.g. age, income, education, race/ethnicity). Aim 3: Evaluate the potential role of gender identity as a moderator between health care stressors and symptoms of both emotional distress and impaired physical functioning. Evaluating a potential measure of GM health care stressors can enhance the quality of research in the field. Findings can also be used to inform interventions and policy guidelines that will improve health care for GM people by reducing the symptom burden experienced. The training and experience acquired to achieve these outcomes will provide a solid foundation for this investigator’s developing program of research. Project Narrative  This study will identify the stressors experienced by under-served and often marginalized people when they seek health care and the relationship of these stressors to symptoms of potential health problems. By better understanding the types of stressors that occur in health care, changes can be made to how care is provided and how health care personnel are educated. Interventions to prevent and manage physical and emotional symptoms associated with these stressors can also be developed.",The Relationship of Stressors in Health Care to Emotional and Physical Symptoms Experienced by Marginalized People,9910198,F31NR019000,"['psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' systematic review ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' flu ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender men ', ' transmen ', ' transman ', ' trans-men ', ' gender minority ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' cisgender ', ' cis-gender ', ' racial minority ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' emotional symptom ', ' physical symptom ', ' symptom science ', ' secondary analysis ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Play ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' sound ', ' Stress ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Physical Function ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2019,36792,-0.0058908394403936045
"Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions Over 25% of the adult population in the United States suffers from multiple chronic conditions (MCC), with numbers rising, especially among Black men and women who experience the highest MCC morbidity. Those with MCC often experience symptoms or symptom clusters that undermine their quality of life and ability to self-manage. Importantly, symptom severity in those with even the same MCC varies, suggesting that the mechanisms driving symptoms in MCC are not fixed but vary in ways that may make them amenable to targeted interventions – the very essence of nursing science. The over-arching goal of the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” is to strengthen the capacities of a diverse faculty of nurse scientists to conduct innovative translational research using cutting-edge metabolomics and microbiomic technologies to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC. The Center’s research aim is to apply next-generation metabolomics technology and data analytic strategies to stimulate discovery of the metabolites and metabolic pathways that are present in individuals with MCC, focusing on the metabolites and metabolic pathways that synergize across conditions and associate with severe symptoms of fatigue, depression, or anxiety and their cluster, but are less represented in individuals with MCC who have minimal or no symptoms. Metabolites and pathways associated with symptoms will be evaluated in light of covariates such as sex as a biological variable, age, stress and discrimination, diet and medications. An exploratory aim will investigate the composition of the gut microbiome as a potential covariate to these symptoms. This aim takes advantage of our School’s strength in microbiome research and evidence linking the microbiome to these symptoms. Pilots 1-3 will examine the circulating metabolites and metabolic profiles that associate with the severity of the symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety in individuals with MCC and in light of covariates, and examine the associations at each time point, while pilot 4 will apply data analytic techniques to model the complex pathways associated with symptom severity, synergy, cluster, and health quality outcomes in MCC. Pilot 5 will test the Pilot 4 model for proof of concept that the metabolites and covariates identified in Pilots 1-3 do associate with symptom severity and are valid targets for intervention. Metabolites associated with symptoms in MCC, including those that synergize, that contribute to clustering, or are microbiome-associated, have yet to be described. Of the 26 Center Personnel, 18 are Center Faculty and Members. Our research base in MCC, self-management, metabolomics, and the microbiome is strong with annual direct costs of $4.7 million. The Center for Data Science is supported with ½ million dollars annually, and will provide infrastructure to the Data Science Core. We will leverage resources of the Emory Metabolomics and Integrated Genomic Cores. Equipping junior faculty to consider complex theories and employ cutting-edge technology, while focused on translation, prepares future nurse scientists to address issues that matter to patients and families. Center Project Narrative The number of individuals living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is rising world-wide, with Black men and women most often negatively affected in the United States. Through the work of its Administrative, Pilot, Enrichment, and Data Science Cores, the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” will strengthen the capacity of junior nurse faculty to make use of sophisticated metabolomic and microbiome technologies and cutting-edge data analytic strategies to conduct innovative translational research to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC, improving public health for generations to come.","Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions",9763654,P30NR018090,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' nursing intervention ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' health related quality of life ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' metabolic profile ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' symptom science ', ' symptom cluster ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' dysbiosis ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' dysbiotic ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2019,531022,0.10300435055404167
"Sex Differences in Pulmonary Exacerbations in Cystic Fibrosis Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal inherited disorder in Caucasians and affects 30,000 individuals in the United States and 70,000 individuals worldwide. Median survival now exceeds 47 years, but despite advancements in therapies and improved life expectancy, those individuals affected by CF continue to have increased morbidity and mortality. Individuals with CF have frequent pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) resulting in a decline in lung function, reduced quality of life and decreased survival.  CF is a disease with equal prevalence between men and women, but women with CF have been shown to have increased mortality compared to men since the 1970s. However, the majority of data was collected prior to implementation of guidelines and novel pharmacologic therapies in this population; thus, more information is needed to identify if this disparity still exists. We hypothesize that women have increased frequency of PEx, accelerated lung function decline, slower recovery to baseline after treatment for a PEx, and decreased survival compared to men. Furthermore, it is unknown if women present with worse respiratory symptoms at onset of PEx, nor do we know if women and men are being treated differently in regards to antibiotic selection, route of antibiotics (oral versus intravenous (IV)), or duration of treatment. We propose that women present with more severe symptoms and are being treated more often with oral antibiotics and shorter duration of IV antibiotics, when prescribed, which can result in treatment failure. Finally, estrogen has been linked to PEx susceptibility in women. Further research is needed to understand the effects of hormonal variation and hormone therapy on respiratory symptoms and PEx in women with CF.  We have preliminary evidence from our local cohort that women have more PEx per year compared to men. This proposal builds upon these findings by accessing data from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR), and two multi-center trials in PEx conducted by my direct mentorship team: the Early Intervention in Cystic Fibrosis (eICE) study and the Standardized Treatment of Pulmonary Exacerbations (STOP) study. This current study will (1) evaluate a national cohort by analyzing the CFFPR to assess for current trends of frequency of PEx, lung function decline, recovery to baseline after treatment for a PEx and mortality; (2) analyze two multi-site studies (eICE and STOP) to obtain more precise information regarding sex differences in symptom presentation, provider treatment practices, and patient outcomes for a PEx; (3) leverage prospective data collected from women in our adult CF center evaluating menstrual cycle patterns, use of hormonal therapy and frequency of PEx and associated respiratory symptoms.  The results of this proposal are directed at addressing public health disparities, and can impact the treatment and outcomes of women with CF worldwide. Furthermore, findings will highlight clinical presentations of PEx in women, which could lead to improvements in therapeutic management and outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disorder in Caucasians affecting 70,000 individuals worldwide, and results in repeated pulmonary infections leading to decreased lung function, quality of life, and survival. Given that CF is a disease with equal prevalence across sexes, yet women with CF have decreased survival compared to men, this proposal aims to determine how sex affects treatment practices and outcomes in CF patients and the role of hormonal variations on respiratory symptoms and frequency of pulmonary exacerbations in women with CF. The results of this study will address the sex disparity that exists in the CF population and can influence therapeutic management to improve outcomes in women with CF worldwide.",Sex Differences in Pulmonary Exacerbations in Cystic Fibrosis Patients,9822923,F32HL143833,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Female ', ' Preovulatory Phase ', ' Menstrual Proliferative Phase ', ' Follicular Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Follicular Phase ', ' proliferative phase Menstrual cycle ', ' Timed Vital Capacity ', ' Timed Forced Vital Capacity ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume ', ' FEVt ', ' Forced expiratory volume function ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inborn error ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung transplant ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' Lung Transplantation ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Mentorship ', ' Microbiology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Mucociliary Transport ', ' Mucociliary Clearance ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' P.aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' mucoid ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Multicenter Trials ', ' Multi-center trial ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Early Intervention ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Estrogen Therapy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' Intravenous ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Hormonal ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' patient registry ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Virulent ', ' trend ', ' sex ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' individuals with cystic fibrosis ', ' individuals with CF ', ' CF patients ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' clinical predictors ', ' improved outcome ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' data access ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Lung infections ', ' pulmonary infections ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,56207,0.02313800603296774
"Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly reduces the risk of hospitalizations, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increases quality of life. Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience. Our study will test use of a web-enabled app with tailored feedback that is integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record. This app is designed to improve patient-provider communication about adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits among diverse patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We will evaluate the intervention on a comprehensive set of outcomes, including rigorous measures of long-term adherence, quality of life, and costs.",Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence,9768995,R01CA218155,"['malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' mortality ', ' physician office visit ', ' Office Visits ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tablets ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Time Management ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patient Noncompliance ', ' Patient Nonadherence ', ' Patient Non-Adherence ', ' Patient Non Compliance ', ' Nonadherent patient ', ' Non-adherent patient ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Adjuvant ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' web-enabled ', ' chemotherapy ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' three-arm study ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' side effect ', ' adherence rate ', ' ']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,424295,0.05086204994587611
"Neuroendocrine Mechanisms of Risk for Trauma-Related Psychopathology in Women Project Summary The majority of Americans will experience a traumatic event during their lifetimes, but women are twice as likely as men to experience negative psychiatric outcomes following trauma such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The reason for the increased prevalence in women is unclear, partially because of the historical lack of investigation of females in both human and pre-clinical animal research. In the proposed research, we will investigate the role of sex hormones in contributing to women's risk for PTSD. The gonadal hormone estradiol (E2) has previously been associated with emotion regulation and fear extinction in rodent and healthy human studies, mediated by plasticity in pathways between the amygdala and regulatory inputs from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Women with PTSD show clear deficits in regulating emotional arousal, and in fear extinction learning. We will test the hypothesis that low E2 contributes to these deficits by experimentally manipulating E2, and studying its effects on fMRI measures of threat reactivity and fear extinction, in women with PTSD, trauma-exposed women without PTSD, and healthy controls. We will use a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects crossover design, with E2/placebo given to naturally-cycling women during the early follicular phase of the cycle when endogenous E2 is lowest. Participants will be randomized to E2 or placebo at the first MRI scan, and will cross over to the other condition for a second scan conducted at the same point in the subsequent menstrual cycle. Secondly, given existing observational evidence that PTSD risk/symptoms are heightened during the luteal phase, we will test this E2 administration in the luteal phase to observe whether an increase in the E2-progesterone ratio reduces PTSD symptoms and impairments in threat reactivity and fear extinction in this time of heightened risk. The research environment at Emory University School of Medicine will provide excellent support for the successful completion of the proposed research, particularly with state of the art neuroimaging facilities, a well-developed infrastructure for identifying participants at risk for trauma and PTSD through the Grady Trauma Project, and a strong community of experts in trauma, neuroendocrine, neuroimaging, and women's health research. Findings from this study may aid in the development of new treatments and interventions to increase women's mental health outcomes following trauma. Project narrative Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most universal and severe psychiatric disorders whose incidence continues to rise due to the common exposure to severe trauma in the United States and worldwide. Women are more vulnerable than men to negative psychiatric outcomes following trauma, with twice the incidence of PTSD and mood disorders. Identifying hormonal contributors to PTSD vulnerability in women will help to bridge this health disparity.",Neuroendocrine Mechanisms of Risk for Trauma-Related Psychopathology in

"Monitoring Microaggressions and Adversities to Generate Interventions for Change (MMAGIC) for Black Women Living with HIV Background: Both nationally and particularly in Miami, FL, an HIV epicenter in the U.S., Black women represent the largest group of women living with HIV and 42% are not virally suppressed. In our ongoing research with Black women living with HIV (BWLWH) in Miami, we are seeing that microaggressions and adversities such as trauma/violence fluctuate rapidly over time and impact mental health and health behaviors. Microaggressions are everyday and subtle insults via comments, jokes, and behaviors that are demeaning to a marginalized group (e.g. Black individuals, women, people living with HIV). While scholars are beginning to investigate macroaggressions (discrimination such as denial of housing) and trauma/violence among women living with HIV, variables are often captured infrequently (e.g. once annually) despite the re-occurring nature of these adversities, and no prior study has investigated microaggressions. Hence, greater scientific rigor is needed to capture the temporal fluctuation in key stressors in the lives of Black women and how they relate to HIV viral suppression. Small-scale cross-sectional studies conducted by this PI (Dale) and colleagues suggest that gendered racial microaggressions experienced by BWLWH significantly predict PTSD symptoms, depression diagnosis, barriers to care, and ART adherence, and that microaggression contributes uniquely to these outcomes above and beyond race- and HIV- related discrimination/macroaggressions. Conceptual Model: The conceptual model for Project MMAGIC (Monitoring Microaggressions and Adversities to Generate Interventions for Change) focuses on microaggressions and other adversities as predictors negatively impacting HIV viral suppression (main outcome) through mental health symptoms and health behaviors (ART adherence and engagement in care), with potential direct effects and moderation by resilience factors at the individual (i.e. self-efficacy), interpersonal (i.e. social support), and neighborhood level (i.e. community health centers). MMAGIC findings will elucidate the pathways through which microaggressions and other adversities impact viral suppression among BWLWH and directly inform interventions through engagement with BWLWH and community stakeholders. This proposal is therefore aligned with the NIH HIV/AIDS (high) Research Priority for supporting research to reduce health disparities in treatment outcomes of those living with HIV/AIDS. Research Plan Overview: 300 BWLWH will be enrolled in Miami, Florida and followed over 4 years. Data will be collected at assessment visits conducted every 3 months on microaggressions, discrimination, trauma and violence, mental health symptoms, medication adherence, engagement in care, viral suppression (main outcome), and resilience factors. Given the daily nature of microaggressions, information on microaggressions will also be collected via one short daily text message. On an annual basis we will also gather information (using zip codes) from public data sources on neighborhood level resilience resources such as number and distance to community health centers and domestic violence shelters. Project Narrative Increasing viral suppression rates among Black women living with HIV (42% unsuppressed) in Miami, FL, a southern HIV epicenter, is necessary to decrease HIV transmission; however our science has not rigorously examined if their viral suppression is impacted by microaggressions, daily stressors that our preliminary evidence has shown predict PTSD symptoms, depression diagnosis, barriers to care, and ART adherence and contribute uniquely to these outcomes above and beyond race- and HIV- related discrimination/ macroaggressions. Project MMAGIC (Monitoring Microaggressions and Adversities to Generate Interventions for Change) will shed light on how microaggressions and other adversities (e.g. reoccurring violence) impact viral suppression among BWLWH as mediated by mental health symptoms and health behaviors and potentially moderated by resilience factors. With findings that will directly generate community-informed interventions to improve viral suppression among BWLWH, MMAGIC may help us to move closer to Zero Infections, Zero Discrimination, and Zero AIDS-Related Deaths.",Monitoring Microaggressions and Adversities to Generate Interventions for Change (MMAGIC) for Black Women Living with HIV,9980143,R56MH121194,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Housing ', ' Infection ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Voice ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Caring ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' sexual assault ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' Individual ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Investigation ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' neglect ', ' Posttraumatic growth ', ' Post-traumatic growth ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' trauma symptom ', ' intersectionality ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R56,2019,677248,-0.007482367236054633
"Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions Over 25% of the adult population in the United States suffers from multiple chronic conditions (MCC), with numbers rising, especially among Black men and women who experience the highest MCC morbidity. Those with MCC often experience symptoms or symptom clusters that undermine their quality of life and ability to self-manage. Importantly, symptom severity in those with even the same MCC varies, suggesting that the mechanisms driving symptoms in MCC are not fixed but vary in ways that may make them amenable to targeted interventions – the very essence of nursing science. The over-arching goal of the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” is to strengthen the capacities of a diverse faculty of nurse scientists to conduct innovative translational research using cutting-edge metabolomics and microbiomic technologies to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC. The Center’s research aim is to apply next-generation metabolomics technology and data analytic strategies to stimulate discovery of the metabolites and metabolic pathways that are present in individuals with MCC, focusing on the metabolites and metabolic pathways that synergize across conditions and associate with severe symptoms of fatigue, depression, or anxiety and their cluster, but are less represented in individuals with MCC who have minimal or no symptoms. Metabolites and pathways associated with symptoms will be evaluated in light of covariates such as sex as a biological variable, age, stress and discrimination, diet and medications. An exploratory aim will investigate the composition of the gut microbiome as a potential covariate to these symptoms. This aim takes advantage of our School’s strength in microbiome research and evidence linking the microbiome to these symptoms. Pilots 1-3 will examine the circulating metabolites and metabolic profiles that associate with the severity of the symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety in individuals with MCC and in light of covariates, and examine the associations at each time point, while pilot 4 will apply data analytic techniques to model the complex pathways associated with symptom severity, synergy, cluster, and health quality outcomes in MCC. Pilot 5 will test the Pilot 4 model for proof of concept that the metabolites and covariates identified in Pilots 1-3 do associate with symptom severity and are valid targets for intervention. Metabolites associated with symptoms in MCC, including those that synergize, that contribute to clustering, or are microbiome-associated, have yet to be described. Of the 26 Center Personnel, 18 are Center Faculty and Members. Our research base in MCC, self-management, metabolomics, and the microbiome is strong with annual direct costs of $4.7 million. The Center for Data Science is supported with ½ million dollars annually, and will provide infrastructure to the Data Science Core. We will leverage resources of the Emory Metabolomics and Integrated Genomic Cores. Equipping junior faculty to consider complex theories and employ cutting-edge technology, while focused on translation, prepares future nurse scientists to address issues that matter to patients and families. Center Project Narrative The number of individuals living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is rising world-wide, with Black men and women most often negatively affected in the United States. Through the work of its Administrative, Pilot, Enrichment, and Data Science Cores, the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” will strengthen the capacity of junior nurse faculty to make use of sophisticated metabolomic and microbiome technologies and cutting-edge data analytic strategies to conduct innovative translational research to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC, improving public health for generations to come.","Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions",9938165,P30NR018090,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' nursing intervention ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' health related quality of life ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' metabolic profile ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' symptom science ', ' symptom cluster ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' dysbiosis ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' dysbiotic ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2019,201939,0.10300435055404167
"Developing a Pediatrics-based Social Needs Intervention to Reduce Disparities in ADHD Outcomes for Low-income Children PROJECT SUMMARY. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic conditions in childhood, with significantly higher rates and worse outcomes among socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Social adversities including unmet basic needs such as food insecurity, housing instability, and lack of quality child care emerge as potent risk factors for ADHD symptoms as early as the preschool years. The development of early intervention strategies for young children with both ADHD and socioeconomic disadvantage is critical for mitigating future impairment. New research demonstrates that a low intensity, family-centered screening and referral program (WE CARE) at well infant visits is feasible and can increase receipt of resources for unmet social needs (e.g. food, transportation, and parent education). Adapting this strategy to target preschoolers with emerging ADHD, who are typically first identified in primary care, could significantly impact clinical symptoms and disease trajectory during a critical developmental period. Therefore, the objective of this project is develop an early intervention strategy, adapted from the WE CARE program, targeting unmet social needs for low-income families of preschool-age children with emerging ADHD. The WE CARE intervention will be adapted on 3 key domains (for a new target population, content, and primary outcomes) through the pursuit of 3 interrelated studies. These are: 1) Examine the association between specific unmet social needs and ADHD symptoms in 7,565 nationally representative children age 3-5 from the National Survey for Children's Health (NSCH) and explore potential mediators of this association (including parental stress, activation, and unmet need for care) via structural equation modeling (SEM); 2) Identify parent-reported mechanisms by which unmet social needs exacerbate ADHD symptoms in preschool age children and how an intervention addressing these needs could improve clinical outcomes by conducting semi-structured interviews with 25 parents of preschoolers with ADHD symptoms; and 3) Conduct an adaptive, randomized pilot trial of a novel treatment model addressing unmet social needs with parents of 60 low-income children age 3-5 with ADHD symptoms. This research plan reflects Objective 3.2 of the NIMH Strategic Plan, to develop ways to tailor existing and new interventions to optimize outcomes, and addresses an urgent need to reduce socioeconomic disparities in pediatric mental health outcomes by targeting modifiable risk factors in vulnerable young children. These research aims will also serve as vehicles for pragmatic learning of the following training goals: 1) Learn advanced statistical modeling and measurement methods for social determinants research; 2) Gain expertise in intervention development to reduce mental health disparities; and 3) Obtain training in modern clinical trial design for the study of psychosocial and health services interventions. This mentored K23 award will facilitate Dr. Spencer's long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator developing novel interventions to reduce socioeconomic inequities in pediatric psychiatric outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE ADHD is one of the most common chronic illnesses in childhood, with a general prevalence of 5-10%, and disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Preschool ADHD onset is associated with worse illness and treatment-emergent side effects, and socioeconomic adversity increases the likelihood of treatment non-response and future morbidity in young children. Interventions addressing unmet social needs in preschoolers with ADHD symptoms could significantly reduce socioeconomic disparities in ADHD persistence and outcomes.",Developing a Pediatrics-based Social Needs Intervention to Reduce Disparities in ADHD Outcomes for Low-income Children,9789941,K23MH118478,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Special Education ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' School Enrollments ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' psychosocial service ', ' Psychiatric Social Service ', ' Psychiatric Social Work ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' programs ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Inferior ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' preference ', ' Arvin ', ' Arwin ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pilot trial ', ' housing instability ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' service intervention ', ' collaborative care ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' Child Health ', ' food insecurity ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,164094,0.057921703048544056
"The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants of Health (SEMOARS)  during Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Project Summary Abstract Abstract: The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants (SEMOARS) Background: Black women with breast cancer in the United States have a lower 5 year survival than whites for stage-matched disease. Our past and ongoing work and that of others suggests that symptom incidence, cancer related distress and ineffective communication contribute to racial disparity in dose reduction and early therapy termination. Aims:1) Examine and compare chemotherapy received/chemotherapy prescribed over time and in total of matched black and white women prescribed BC chemotherapy. 2) Examine and compare the symptom incidence, distress and management, clinical encounter including patient centeredness of care and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy over time. 2a) Correlate the symptom incidence symptom incidence, distress and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy to Aim 1. 3) Explore the effects of social determinants of health including age, income, education, zip code and lifetime stress exposure on Aims 1, 2 and 3. Hypothesis: Inherent differences including race and possibly social determinants of health between black and white women in the experience, perception, communication and outcomes of symptoms during breast cancer chemotherapy interfere with chemotherapy adherence. Methods: Longitudinal frequent repeated-measures (18 data collections), comparative, mixed methods (audiotapes of clinic visits) descriptive design of 179 white and 179 black women from 6 sites at Western Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio over the course of chemotherapy. Innovation: The intense assessment of symptoms, distress and quality of life and the clinical encounter in multiple repeated measures as compared by race and social determinants of health on the ability to receive full dose chemotherapy is patient centered and innovative. Significance/Public Health: If these relationships and racial differences are confirmed and the mediating factors identified as actionable targets, this information will fill a critical gap in the quality care literature, advancing the understanding and potential mitigation strategies for the static racial survival disparity in breast cancer. These identified targets hold implication for public health. Project Narrative  This proposal, in response to PA-16-160, National Institute of Minority Health and Disparity (NIMHD) Research Project Grant (Parent R01) has the goal of creating an important explanatory model regarding the process of symptom experience, symptom reporting, management and symptom outcomes leading to the ability to receive full dose of prescribed therapy according to race and considering social determinants for women receiving breast cancer chemotherapy. Defining barriers to receiving full dose and timely therapeutics are an important strategy for mitigation of treatment and survival disparity in breast cancer.","The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants of Health (SEMOARS)  during Breast Cancer Chemotherapy",9710371,R01MD012245,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Audiotape ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Empathy ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Ohio ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Distress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Severities ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' treatment cessation ', ' cessation of treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Process ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' minority health ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' chemotherapy ', ' comparative ', ' social health determinants ', ' Regimen ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' survival outcome ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,652432,-0.06901114744645719
"Tailoring treatment targets for early autism intervention in Africa The public health impact of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is gaining global recognition. Early  intervention for ASD is of critical importance because it improves outcomes and lessons long-term  costs. Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs), are a type of empirically-based  early ASD intervention methods that can be taught to caregivers, via caregiver-coaching. Caregiver  use of NDBI strategies can promote child joint attention and affective engagement, which promote  language acquisition - a key predictor of long-term functional outcomes. However, very little  behavioral and developmental research that examines the principles and underlying assumptions of  NDBIs has been performed outside of Western contexts. In addition, ASD research has  disproportionately low representation from minority groups, multilingual families, and participants  from lower socioeconomic status. Importantly, cross-cultural variation has been reported in NDBI  treatment targets, such as core ASD symptoms and features of caregiver-child interactions.  Fundamental gaps in our knowledge therefore remain on the validity of NDBI treatment targets,  especially in multi-cultural  settings. In addition, objectively assessing NDBI response is a  significant challenge. 'Gold standard' tools are costly, require trained professionals, and may not  be culturally valid. MHealth tools that assess ASD biomarkers may help address this challenge by  enabling point-of-care detection by non-specialists. Efforts to implement NDBIs in multi-cultural  community settings is increasing worldwide. Alongside these efforts, it is crucial to ensure that  our treatment targets are valid and that we can measure treatment response. The R21 builds upon  work conducted in an NIMH-funded K01 (PI: Franz). In the first study of its kind on the African  continent, Dr Franz has adapted a caregiver-coaching NDBI for delivery by non-specialists, and  'gold standard' clinical outcomes as well as implementation outcomes are being assessed. The R21  aims to extend this work by evaluating NDBI treatment targets and a novel digital outcome measure  of treatment response, following 12 sessions of NDBI-informed caregiver coaching, delivered by  non-specialists in South Africa. South Africa, a multi-cultural nation marked by health  disparities, is an innovative study location because it provides a unique opportunity to assess  feasibility and impact of a scalable intervention, in an environment with significant contextual  challenges. The R21 is a joint project between Duke University and the University of Cape Town  (UCT). While all research activities will be conducted in Cape Town, South Africa, ASD clinical  research capacity building will include both UCT and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) in  Tanzania, via a South-to-South collaboration. Both sites are included in order to prepare our team  to develop an R01 application for a regionally-focused randomized ASD early intervention clinical  trial, which will include sites in both South Africa and Tanzania and allow for further refinement  of innovative clinical outcome measures.

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging

"Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women and men are at different risks for the onset, expression, and treatment response in a number of disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan, from development through aging. The mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those disorders specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of disorders important for women's health. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, with some focus on female- specific periods such as child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) is and will continue to be the home site for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health with Mentors who already collaborate across institutions at BWH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each of the two Scholars is assigned a team of Mentors in order to operationalize the concept of training Scholars to think in a translational manner. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the Scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, suggest coursework, and readings, depending on the Scholar's interests. Career Mentors advise Scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose Scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in predicting morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on the following disorders, given either their known higher incidence and/or differential expression in women than men and the strengths of the Harvard community in women's health: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard, we believe that Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that is training the next generation of leaders in women's health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there is a strong need for the education, training, and development of junior investigators who will commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Their research programs will provide the basis for the development of sex-dependent treatment approaches and public awareness of the importance of these sex-dependent health issues for families and society.",Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: Bench to Bedside,9773725,K12HD051959,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aging ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Boston ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Genes ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Israel ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Puberty ', ' Reading ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Training Programs ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Endocrine ', ' interest ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' DF/HCC ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' next generation ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' translational approach ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2019,548640,0.07466664792192776
"Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions Over 25% of the adult population in the United States suffers from multiple chronic conditions (MCC), with numbers rising, especially among Black men and women who experience the highest MCC morbidity. Those with MCC often experience symptoms or symptom clusters that undermine their quality of life and ability to self-manage. Importantly, symptom severity in those with even the same MCC varies, suggesting that the mechanisms driving symptoms in MCC are not fixed but vary in ways that may make them amenable to targeted interventions – the very essence of nursing science. The over-arching goal of the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” is to strengthen the capacities of a diverse faculty of nurse scientists to conduct innovative translational research using cutting-edge metabolomics and microbiomic technologies to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC. The Center’s research aim is to apply next-generation metabolomics technology and data analytic strategies to stimulate discovery of the metabolites and metabolic pathways that are present in individuals with MCC, focusing on the metabolites and metabolic pathways that synergize across conditions and associate with severe symptoms of fatigue, depression, or anxiety and their cluster, but are less represented in individuals with MCC who have minimal or no symptoms. Metabolites and pathways associated with symptoms will be evaluated in light of covariates such as sex as a biological variable, age, stress and discrimination, diet and medications. An exploratory aim will investigate the composition of the gut microbiome as a potential covariate to these symptoms. This aim takes advantage of our School’s strength in microbiome research and evidence linking the microbiome to these symptoms. Pilots 1-3 will examine the circulating metabolites and metabolic profiles that associate with the severity of the symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety in individuals with MCC and in light of covariates, and examine the associations at each time point, while pilot 4 will apply data analytic techniques to model the complex pathways associated with symptom severity, synergy, cluster, and health quality outcomes in MCC. Pilot 5 will test the Pilot 4 model for proof of concept that the metabolites and covariates identified in Pilots 1-3 do associate with symptom severity and are valid targets for intervention. Metabolites associated with symptoms in MCC, including those that synergize, that contribute to clustering, or are microbiome-associated, have yet to be described. Of the 26 Center Personnel, 18 are Center Faculty and Members. Our research base in MCC, self-management, metabolomics, and the microbiome is strong with annual direct costs of $4.7 million. The Center for Data Science is supported with ½ million dollars annually, and will provide infrastructure to the Data Science Core. We will leverage resources of the Emory Metabolomics and Integrated Genomic Cores. Equipping junior faculty to consider complex theories and employ cutting-edge technology, while focused on translation, prepares future nurse scientists to address issues that matter to patients and families. Center Project Narrative The number of individuals living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is rising world-wide, with Black men and women most often negatively affected in the United States. Through the work of its Administrative, Pilot, Enrichment, and Data Science Cores, the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” will strengthen the capacity of junior nurse faculty to make use of sophisticated metabolomic and microbiome technologies and cutting-edge data analytic strategies to conduct innovative translational research to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC, improving public health for generations to come.","Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions",9976727,P30NR018090,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' nursing intervention ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' health related quality of life ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' metabolic profile ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' symptom science ', ' symptom cluster ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' dysbiosis ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' dysbiotic ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2019,338019,0.10300435055404167
"Sex and stress: effects on the brain - gut axis PROJECT SUMMARY  Women display higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders, including functional dyspepsia (FD), and report a higher severity of dyspeptic symptoms compared to men. Although physiological mechanisms that mediate this sex disparity in gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are not fully understood, it has been suggested that they may be mediated by circulating estrogen.  Gastric motility is modulated by neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) and the activity of these neurons is regulated by a robust tonic GABAergic input. Estrogen has been shown to increase GABA expression and release in several regions of the central nervous system (CNS), as well as to modulate neuronal morphology and synaptic activity.  Based on our preliminary studies that indicate an estrogen-dependent modulation of vagal output to the stomach, we will test the following novel hypothesis: “Functional gastrointestinal disorders are increased in severity and incidence in females due, in part, to an estrogen mediated decrease in vagal outflow to the stomach”. To investigate this novel hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological, behavioral, chemogenetic, and anatomical approaches in a rodent model aimed at interrogating the role of stress and estrogen on the brain-gut axis.  The results of the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide a deeper understanding of the cellular and neural mechanisms by which estrogen influences the etiology of FD, help identify potential targets for more effective therapeutic interventions directed specifically towards women, and provide novel insights into changes in GI functions that occur in the perimenopausal period. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Functional gastrointestinal motility disorders (FGID) are common conditions that account for a large proportion of consultations with primary care and specialist physicians. Since women display slower gastric transit, and report a higher incidence and increased severity of FGID, it has been suggested that they are mediated by circulating estrogen. In the present proposal we will use a rodent model in which we will investigate the role of estrogen in determining the resilience or exacerbation that underlie the sex differences in gastric-related neural pathways. Our purpose is to identifying potential targets for more effective therapeutic interventions that can be directed specifically towards women, and to provide novel insights into changes in gastric functions that occur in the perimenopausal period.",Sex and stress: effects on the brain - gut axis,9830276,R01DK120170,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Consultations ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Indigestion ', ' Dyspepsia ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Female ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' stomach emptying ', ' Gastric Emptying ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' Gastrointestinal Motility ', ' Gastrointestinal Transit ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' motoneuron ', ' Motor Cell ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Nuclear Membrane ', ' Nuclear Envelope ', ' Recombinant Oxytocin ', ' Ocytocin ', ' Oxytocin ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' gastric ', ' Stomach ', ' Stress ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' Thyroid-Releasing Hormone ', ' Pyr-His-ProNH2 ', ' Protyreline ', ' Protirelin ', ' 5-Oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide ', ' Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' GABA Receptor ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Receptors ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Severities ', ' irritation ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' gastrointestinal function ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders ', ' dorsal motor nucleus ', ' Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus ', ' experience ', ' receptor expression ', ' motility disorder ', ' dysmotility syndrome ', ' dysmotility ', ' novel ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' patch clamp ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Perimenopause ', ' peri-menopause ', ' peri-menopausal ', ' Perimenopausal ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Slice ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' resilience ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Neonatal ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' sensory input ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' gut-brain axis ', ' gut-brain signaling ', ' gut-brain relationship ', ' gut-brain interactions ', ' gut-brain communication ', ' gut to brain axis ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,344925,0.0198124589269143
"Psychosocial Syndemics and Multimorbidity in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure Approximately 6.2 million Americans have heart failure (HF) and the prevalence is increasing rapidly. HF is a common cause of hospitalization and mortality in older adults, and the cost of hospital care for HF is skyrocketing. One reason why HF is so burdensome and costly is that it is often complicated by cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities, especially in older patients. Psychiatric and medical disorders that are risk factors for incident HF persist after HF has developed, and additional comorbidities accumulate as patients with HF grow older. Thus, HF is embedded within a larger pattern of multimorbidity. Unfortunately, most trials of HF therapies as well as many other studies of HF have excluded patients with complex psychiatric and medical comorbidities or severe cognitive impairment. This has left large gaps in research on the care of older adults with HF. In addition, research on socioeconomic risk factors and health disparities has not been integrated with research on multimorbidity in HF. Heart failure is only one of multiple challenges facing patients with multimorbidity, stressful socioeconomic circumstances, and psychosocial problems, but the fragmentation of research on HF has left us with little understanding of patients with complex psychosocial problems. The purpose of this study is to identify combinations of comorbidities and health disparities may affect HF outcomes and require different mixtures of medical, psychological, and social services to address. It will encompass both psychiatric and medical comorbidities but will emphasize the role of psychiatric comorbidities. Syndemics theory is a useful framework for studying this type of psychosocial and medical complexity. Syndemics, also known as synergistic epidemics, occur when there are adverse interactions between prevalent disorders that concentrate in populations that are vulnerable due to adverse socioeconomic or environmental conditions. The syndemics framework has yielded important insights into a number of other disorders, but it has not been used to study the complex psychosocial problems of patients with HF. To our knowledge, this will be the first study of the syndemics of psychiatric and medical comorbidities in heart failure. The multimorbidity framework is an alternative approach for investigating the effects of multiple comorbidities on health outcomes. The specific aims of the study are: 1) to determine the coprevalence of major psychiatric and medical comorbidities in hospitalized patients with HF (n=535); 2) to determine whether coprevalent comorbidities have synergistic effects on 30-day all-cause readmission and mortality risks, heart failure self-care, and health-related quality of life; 3) to identify vulnerable subpopulations of hospitalized patients with HF who have higher coprevalences of syndemic comorbidities compared to less vulnerable subpopulations; 4) to determine the extent to which syndemic comorbidities explain adverse HF outcomes (30-day readmissions and mortality, poor self-care, and poor health-related quality of life) in vulnerable subgroups of hospitalized patients with HF; and 5) to determine the effects of multimorbidity on readmissions, mortality risk, self-care, and quality of life. Heart failure (HF) is a common and debilitating chronic disease with a poor prognosis. Many patients with HF have psychiatric problems such as depression and other medical disorders such as lung or kidney disease. This study will examine the effects that these psychiatric and medical disorders have on HF outcomes.",Psychosocial Syndemics and Multimorbidity in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure,9938966,R01HL151431,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Caring ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Left ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' insight ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' frailty ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' re-admission risk ', ' readmission risk ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,767592,-0.012351336895616532
"Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions Over 25% of the adult population in the United States suffers from multiple chronic conditions (MCC), with numbers rising, especially among Black men and women who experience the highest MCC morbidity. Those with MCC often experience symptoms or symptom clusters that undermine their quality of life and ability to self-manage. Importantly, symptom severity in those with even the same MCC varies, suggesting that the mechanisms driving symptoms in MCC are not fixed but vary in ways that may make them amenable to targeted interventions – the very essence of nursing science. The over-arching goal of the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” is to strengthen the capacities of a diverse faculty of nurse scientists to conduct innovative translational research using cutting-edge metabolomics and microbiomic technologies to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC. The Center’s research aim is to apply next-generation metabolomics technology and data analytic strategies to stimulate discovery of the metabolites and metabolic pathways that are present in individuals with MCC, focusing on the metabolites and metabolic pathways that synergize across conditions and associate with severe symptoms of fatigue, depression, or anxiety and their cluster, but are less represented in individuals with MCC who have minimal or no symptoms. Metabolites and pathways associated with symptoms will be evaluated in light of covariates such as sex as a biological variable, age, stress and discrimination, diet and medications. An exploratory aim will investigate the composition of the gut microbiome as a potential covariate to these symptoms. This aim takes advantage of our School’s strength in microbiome research and evidence linking the microbiome to these symptoms. Pilots 1-3 will examine the circulating metabolites and metabolic profiles that associate with the severity of the symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety in individuals with MCC and in light of covariates, and examine the associations at each time point, while pilot 4 will apply data analytic techniques to model the complex pathways associated with symptom severity, synergy, cluster, and health quality outcomes in MCC. Pilot 5 will test the Pilot 4 model for proof of concept that the metabolites and covariates identified in Pilots 1-3 do associate with symptom severity and are valid targets for intervention. Metabolites associated with symptoms in MCC, including those that synergize, that contribute to clustering, or are microbiome-associated, have yet to be described. Of the 26 Center Personnel, 18 are Center Faculty and Members. Our research base in MCC, self-management, metabolomics, and the microbiome is strong with annual direct costs of $4.7 million. The Center for Data Science is supported with ½ million dollars annually, and will provide infrastructure to the Data Science Core. We will leverage resources of the Emory Metabolomics and Integrated Genomic Cores. Equipping junior faculty to consider complex theories and employ cutting-edge technology, while focused on translation, prepares future nurse scientists to address issues that matter to patients and families. Center Project Narrative The number of individuals living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is rising world-wide, with Black men and women most often negatively affected in the United States. Through the work of its Administrative, Pilot, Enrichment, and Data Science Cores, the “Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions” will strengthen the capacity of junior nurse faculty to make use of sophisticated metabolomic and microbiome technologies and cutting-edge data analytic strategies to conduct innovative translational research to reduce symptoms in individuals with MCC, improving public health for generations to come.","Center for the Study of Symptom Science, Metabolomics and Multiple Chronic Conditions",9938690,P30NR018090,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' nursing intervention ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' microbiome ', ' health related quality of life ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' gut microbiome ', ' metabolic profile ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom science ', ' symptom cluster ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome science ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome research ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' dysbiosis ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Data Science Resource Core ', ' Data Science Core ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,933465,0.10300435055404167
"mHealth for Heart Failure Symptom Monitoring ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding better ways to engage patients with heart failure (HF) in symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers. Symptoms are the main driver of health- related outcomes for patients with HF and the primary driver of repeated hospital readmissions. Given that we are located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, a predominantly poor Latino community, we are uniquely positioned to address the health disparity in clinical outcomes for Latino patients with HF as well as others with HF using a mobile health (mHealth) application (app). The proposed long-term goal of this NIH K99/R00 application is to assist the candidate, Dr. Masterson Creber, in becoming an independent investigator with a program of research focusing on high quality, technology-based behavioral health interventions to improve outcomes and support patient-centered cardiovascular care for underserved patients with HF. The overall objective of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that a novel app, mi.Symptoms can meaningfully alter patient-reported and clinical outcomes of patients with HF and lead to more successful symptom recognition, response and communication with healthcare providers. The central hypothesis is that empowering patients to take more control of their symptom experience using a technology-enabled point-of-care symptom reporting intervention (mi.Symptoms) can meaningfully alter symptom response behaviors the clinical outcomes of patients with HF. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in the K99 phase of the study by pursing the following specific aims: 1) test the reliability and validity of mi.Symptoms (a novel mHealth app developed by Dr. Masterson Creber and a team from Columbia University School of Engineering), and 2) assess the usability of mi.Symptoms and examine relationships of its use with changes in patient-reported outcomes in a pilot feasibility study. In the R00 phase of the study, the specific aim is to: 3) examine the efficacy o mi.Symptoms on improving patient-reported and clinical outcomes as compared to usual care. The training plan for this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will enable Dr. Masterson Creber to couple skills in biomedical informatics with clinical trial design and outcomes research. The approach has three innovative features: 1) it is grounded in the Theory of Situation Awareness in Dynamic Systems; 2) there is a close link between the theoretical model and unique functional elements of the mi.Symptoms web app (tailoring to patient preference by choosing an avatar, prompting to report symptoms, reinforcing symptom reporting with hedonic motivation, and decreasing barriers to facilitate communication with providers); and 3) it applies growth modeling to the analysis of multiple symptoms and outcomes over time. Findings from this study will provide insights into the development and testing of mi.Symptoms as well as many other mHealth apps. The research is significant because it addresses the important problem of patients with HF struggling to recognize and respond to their symptoms, and it addresses the health disparity in HF outcomes for Latino patients. To accomplish the aims of this proposed study, a robust mentorship team with internationally and nationally recognized experts has been built, including expertise in biomedical informatics with a focus on mHealth (Dr. Suzanne Bakken), cardiovascular behavioral health and clinical trial design (Dr. Karina Davidson), user-centered design (Dr. Steven Feiner), clinical heart failure management (Dr. Mathew Maurer), symptom monitoring (Dr. Kathleen Hickey), quantitative methodologies (Dr. Christopher Lee), and mHealth application development and testing (Dr. Cornelia Ruland). Since a spectrum of new knowledge and skills regarding biomedical informatics, computer science and user-interfaces, and behavioral health clinical trial design are required for the candidate's career as an independent scientist, this K99/R00 award will be extremely important and necessary to achieve the candidate's career objectives and expand symptom science and the science of self- management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because providing patients with heart failure with an accessible mobile Health application to support symptom recognition, response, and communication with healthcare providers may improve patient-reported and clinical outcomes for heart failure and reduce health disparities among Latinos. The proposed research is relevant to the part of the NINR's mission that pertains to improving symptom science and self-management for vulnerable patients with chronic diseases.",mHealth for Heart

"A Brief, Peer Co-Led, Group-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Sexual Minority Young Adult Men Project Summary/Abstract Eating disorders are resistant to treatment and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, efficacious and efficient eating disorder prevention programs are greatly needed. There has been a longstanding belief among the general public, and clinicians, that eating disorders are nearly an exclusively female problem. However, extant literature has found that males also experience eating disorders, constituting up to 40% of individuals with diagnostic/sub-threshold eating pathology. Among males, sexual minorities (i.e., gay, bisexual, and non-heterosexual identified individuals) are a salient subgroup that is at substantial risk for developing eating disorders. Indeed, sexual minority males are not only at elevated risk compared to heterosexual males, but are also at elevated risk compared to heterosexual females. The lifetime prevalence for any eating disorder diagnosis among sexual minority males is 8.8%, and subclinical diagnosis is 15.6%. This is in contrast to heterosexual females, in which the prevalence for clinical and subclinical diagnoses are at 4.8% and 8.0%, respectively. These findings indicate that sexual minority males may well be one of the most vulnerable groups in regard to eating pathology risk. To date, there is a paucity of research on eating disorder prevention programs among sexual minority males. We are only aware of one previous prevention program targeting sexual minority males. This program, the PRIDE Body Project, developed and tested by our research team, is a two-session, peer co-led, group, cognitive dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program, based on existing eating disorder prevention programs developed with females. In our preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT), we found significant and large effects on eating pathology and relevant eating disorder risk factors, compared to a waitlist control condition, at post-treatment and 4-weeks post-treatment. Additionally, preliminary mediation analyses revealed that internalization of the appearance ideal and body dissatisfaction accounted for significant variance in the relationship between treatment condition and eating pathology. These results represent an important first step in demonstrating the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a brief, peer-led eating disorder prevention program for sexual minority males. Despite these initial findings, future research is needed to further test this promising intervention. Specifically, it is not known if the PRIDE Body Project will exert a clinically and statistically significant effect in comparison to a time and attention matched control condition. Additionally, it is unknown if the intervention effects will persist beyond 4-weeks post intervention. With these limitations in mind, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial assessing the PRIDE Body Project to a time and attention-matched active control condition, and follow participants for 24 months. Additionally, we plan to assess potential mediators (body dissatisfaction and internalization of the appearance ideal) of the treatment effect on eating disorder symptoms. Narrative Sexual minority men are one of the most vulnerable groups for developing eating disorders. However, limited data on targeted eating disorder prevention programs exist for this population. Thus, we seek to test the efficacy of a group based, peer co-led, eating disorder prevention program for sexual minority young adult men.","A Brief, Peer Co-Led, Group-Based Eating Disorder Prevention Program for Sexual Minority Young Adult Men",9899754,R01MD012698,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' Bulimia ', ' Bulimia Nervosa ', ' bulimic ', ' Cognitive Dissonance ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Binge eating disorder ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Appearance ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Scheme ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' body dissatisfaction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' treatment effect ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' eating pathology ', ' sexual minority ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' nonheterosexual ', ' non-heterosexual ', ' ']",NIMHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,558239,0.0009493037847821817
"Effectiveness and Implementation of a Mindfulness Intervention for Depressive Symptoms Among Low-income, Racial/Ethnic Minority Adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center The objective of this R01 (PA-16-160) application is to examine the clinical effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention on reducing depressive symptoms among socio-economically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic minority adults and explore factors related to implementation in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). This research will be used to develop a generalizable model for delivery of streamlined mental health interventions in community based settings that will be broadly disseminated and scalable to other populations. Black and Hispanic adults are more likely than those who are White to receive depression treatment in primary care, where antidepressants are the most commonly offered treatment. However, Black and Hispanic adults are less likely than Whites to find antidepressants acceptable. A mindfulness depression intervention provided within primary care may be more accessible and acceptable for low-income, racial/ethnic minority individuals, a severely underserved population. Accumulating research suggests that mindfulness interventions reduce the inflammatory response that can be triggered by stress and improves psychological outcomes. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the clinical effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention (M-Body) on reducing depressive symptoms, compared to usual care, among low-income racial/ethnic minority adults in a FQHC. In preliminary studies, women ages 18-65 with depressive symptoms were recruited from a FQHC to participate in the 8-week, 90 minute per session M-Body intervention. The M-Body intervention is based on Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and has been tailored for the FQHC setting and patient population. Data from four pilot groups led by the PI (N=31) and FQHC health educator (N=41) provide evidence of acceptability, feasibility and improved depressive symptom and stress outcomes over time. Adults (N=330) with depressive symptoms will be recruited from a FQHC in the Chicago, IL area that serves majority racial/ethnic minority individuals (90%) living at or below the poverty line (74%). Half of the patients will be randomized to the M-Body intervention arm where they will receive 8-weeks of mindfulness training led by FQHC staff and the other half will be randomized to usual care. Information on factors relevant to implementation of the intervention in the FQHC will be obtained by convening a series of workgroups and individual interviews with FQHC staff, executive leadership and community stakeholders. Specific Aims: 1) Determine the effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention (M-Body) on reducing depressive symptoms compared to enhanced usual care for racial/ethnic minority adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC); 2) Explore potential mediators (stress related biomarkers, mindfulness) and moderators (age, personal, social, environmental stressors) of the intervention's effect; 3) Conduct a broad assessment of organizational and individual agency factors related to preparation and implementation of the M-Body intervention in a FQHC using a mixed methods approach. Mindfulness based interventions for depression delivered in Federally Qualified Health Centers are a promising approach to providing accessible and acceptable mental health treatment to underserved populations in community based settings. This study will examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention on reducing depressive symptoms among socio-economically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic minority adults and explore factors related to implementation in a FQHC. The findings will be used to develop a generalizable model of delivering streamlined mental health interventions in community settings that can be scalable to wider populations.","Effectiveness and Implementation of a Mindfulness Intervention for Depressive Symptoms Among Low-income, Racial/Ethnic Minority Adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center",10143393,R01MD012236,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' instructor ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' mind body approach ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body wellness ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' daily functioning ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' emotional factor ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mindfulness ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' recruit ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,67125,-0.0020673810491324465
"Evaluation of small-fiber polyneuropathy in youth Project Summary/Abstract This is a renewal application for the R01NS093653 award that has been funding the Oaklander lab's research on small-fiber neuropathy. SFN is a recently recognized peripheral nerve illness that causes chronic pain, usually starting in the feet and spreading up, difficulty completing routine activities and gastrointestinal distress. In 2013, the team studied 41 children and young adults, unexpectedly reporting evidence of SFN in most. Until then, SFN was known only in older adults with diabetes, chemotherapy or other toxic exposures and serious diseases. The lab had discovered a new condition–early onset SFN (eoSFN). For many, it forced withdrawal from school or work, derailing young patients' life trajectories. When the lab then reported that 41% of adults with fibromyalgia also had objective evidence of SFN, implying there might be > 100,000 SFN patients globally, R01NS093653 funded them to develop standardized tools for collecting data about symptoms (the SSS small- fiber symptom survey) and exam abnormalities (the MAGNET Mass General Neuropathy Exam Tool) and a list of best blood tests to screen for potential causes. The PI also directs Mass General's neuropathology lab that confirms SFN diagnoses by examining tiny skin biopsies from patients' lower leg to measure the density of small-fiber nerve endings and compare it to biopsies from normal. So the lab built the Neuropathy Registry, a relational database now containing downloaded electronic medical records plus clinical and research testing from >6500 people evaluated for SFN. It currently includes 6394 biopsy results and >1000 SSS and MAGNETs with more than 1000 new patients added yearly. The PI is also part of the NIH and FDA funded CONCEPPT committee of experts now publishing the 1st formal case definition for SFN, with inclusion requirements for research. These require specific abnormalities that are already captured by the SSS, MAGNET, and skin biopsy. Now Aim 1 proposes to use Registry participants plus new patients and healthy volunteers to adapt and validate the SSS and MAGNET for general medical use by any doctor and for use in children. Aim 2 will collaborate with the Food and Drug Administration's Biomarker Qualification Program to obtain an FDA ruling on lab requirements to improve the quality and accuracy of skin biopsy testing. Aim 3 begins whole-genome study of causes and risks for SFN. It recruits Registry patients with CONCEPPT-defined SFN and adds more via the lab's NeuropathyCommons website and its global collaborators. Dr. Züchner's U. Miami neurogenetics lab will analyze the genomes of qualifying participants to study known and unknown genes that cause or increase risk for SFN. More genetic neuropathies are becoming treatable and Dr. Oaklander helped publish the 1st effective treatment for HSAN1. The final and future goal is to track large numbers of SFN patients and families using secure web and cell-phone versions of the SSS and MAGNET and mailed-in skin biopsies. These will allow them to map SFN's symptoms and natural history, identify new causal pathways and potential treatments, and track children and newly treated patients to monitor long-term outcomes and treatment effects. This is an application to renew current R01 award that has funded our research on small-fiber neuropathy (SFN), which is increasingly linked to fibromyalgia and mysterious multi-symptom illnesses that include unexplained widespread pain, intolerance of exertion and gastrointestinal discomfort. We now propose to revise and optimize the tools we developed for SFN diagnosis for use by doctors and patients around the world and to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to get their Qualification recommendations on how to improve the skin biopsies used globally to confirm SFN diagnoses. We will also collaborate with a leading neuropathy geneticist to sequence the genes of SFN patients we select with our tools that have genetic mutations likely to contribute fundamental knowledge about SFN.",Evaluation of small-fiber polyneuropathy in youth,10053019,R01NS093653,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Age Reporting ', ' Elderly ', '

"Mobile Health Study and Chemoprophylaxis for Preventing Severe Illness from COVID-19 in Cancer The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in late 2019 has resulted in approximately 1.4 million confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with 85,522 confirmed deaths worldwide. The United States has recently taken the lead with the most reported cases across the world, with a total of 395,030 new cases and 12,740 attributable deaths as of today, April 9, 2020. Severe disease occurs in ~10% of cases overall. However, risk for severe disease and mortality is greater in immunocompromised cancer patients, requiring scarce ventilation resources and intensive care unit space to address rapid clinical deterioration in this population. We propose to use the established InsightTM mHealth Platform (supported by the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) mHealth Shared Resource) to monitor symptoms that are consistent with early signs of infection in this high-risk population and automatically (and securely) transfer this information to health care providers. Further, we aim to determine if antimicrobial prophylaxis can mitigate the severity of disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients. Specific Aims: 1. Rapidly deploy a smartphone-based assessment and intervention tool that will enable actively treating cancer patients (N=500) to monitor and self-report symptoms and disease exposures in real-time. The InsightTM app will be downloaded onto the smartphones of patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Standard COVID-19 screening questions and a single chemotherapy risk question will be assessed daily through the smartphone app. Specific responses will automatically trigger an alert to clinic nurses AND provide app-based access to contact the clinic for triage to home care or emergency assessment. 2. Initiate antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients that indicate two symptoms or one symptom with exposure to COVID-19 in advance of or concomitant with SARS-CoV-2 testing. When emergent medical intervention is not required, patients will be randomized to standard supportive care or antimicrobial prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and will use the app to report daily changes in symptoms. 3. Collaboratively document and share lessons learned regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care delivery via telemedicine. We commit to a collegial collaboration with other cancer centers funded to study the use of telemedicine through the COVID-19 CCSG supplement mechanism. This study will determine if an app can be used to rapidly report SARS-CoV2 symptoms, and if antimicrobial prophylaxis reduces severe morbidity and mortality of SAR-CoV2 in immunocompromised cancer patients. The potential reduction of severe COVID-19 mediated disease through: 1) reducing time from symptom detection to treatment initiation, and 2) use of antimicrobial prophylaxis with the repurposed agents listed above. The mHealth platform will be used to monitor symptoms in real-time and facilitate medical triage of high-risk patients. Antimicrobial prophylaxis will further decrease the incidence of COVID-19 mediated morbidity and mortality. OVERALL – PROJECT NARRATIVE Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center.

"Primary-Care Based Mindfulness Intervention for Chronically Traumatized Individuals Project Summary/Abstract Rates of repeated exposure to trauma and levels of trauma-related psychiatric disorders in low-income, urban minority communities far exceed national averages. Despite this, inadequate access and substantial barriers to treatment in urban traumatized populations remain. Mindfulness-based interventions may target emotion dysregulation and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, mechanisms that contribute to trauma-related psychiatric outcomes like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In line with the strategic goals of the NCCIH to improve care for hard-to-manage symptoms, the purpose of this study is to pilot a primary-care based mindfulness intervention for chronically traumatized African Americans screening positive for PTSD and MDD in primary care clinics within an urban public hospital. The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design along with a multi-method psychological and physiological assessment approach to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a [mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention for primary care (MBCT)] versus wait-list control in African Americans with chronic trauma exposure and comorbid PTSD and MDD. Also in line with the strategic goal of NCCIH to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mind-body intervention approaches, preliminary mechanisms of action and change in outcomes associated with MBCT including emotion dysregulation, autonomic function, and PTSD and MDD symptoms will be evaluated. The data collection and [8-session] group intervention will take place in primary care clinics within an urban public hospital serving primarily low-income, minority individuals (>80% African American). Training activities will take place in an academic medical setting under the umbrella of a broader project aimed at understanding psychological and biological risk factors for PTSD. Training goals for this K23 project include 1) learning how to design, implement, and evaluate the outcomes of complementary and integrative behavioral health interventions, 2) [gaining enhanced training in mindfulness and integrated care], 3) learning longitudinal data analytic techniques, and 4) gathering and analyzing psychophysiological variables and integrating psychophysiological data into treatment research. Ultimately, career goals for the applicant include working to improve treatment for underserved civilian trauma populations in urban settings by taking a complementary integrative health perspective and enhance understanding of mechanisms of change in the context of trauma-related treatment. Bringing measures of objective physiological markers like autonomic function into primary care settings in the context of behavioral health treatments will also aid in our understanding of the biological mechanisms that may change as a result of these treatments and how those underlying biological mechanisms can positively impact health outcomes long term. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans living in low-income, urban communities are at risk for repeated exposure to trauma and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, yet there remains inadequate access and substantial barriers to treatment for this at-risk population. This proposal will investigate the initial feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary mechanisms of action and outcomes of a mindfulness-based intervention in primary care for African Americans with chronic trauma exposure and PTSD and depression symptoms, with the goal of improving treatment for underserved civilian trauma populations in urban settings and enhancing understanding of mechanisms

"Tailoring treatment targets for early autism intervention in Africa The public health impact of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is gaining global recognition. Early  intervention for ASD is of critical importance because it improves outcomes and lessons long-term  costs. Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs), are a type of empirically-based  early ASD intervention methods that can be taught to caregivers, via caregiver-coaching. Caregiver  use of NDBI strategies can promote child joint attention and affective engagement, which promote  language acquisition - a key predictor of long-term functional outcomes. However, very little  behavioral and developmental research that examines the principles and underlying assumptions of  NDBIs has been performed outside of Western contexts. In addition, ASD research has  disproportionately low representation from minority groups, multilingual families, and participants  from lower socioeconomic status. Importantly, cross-cultural variation has been reported in NDBI  treatment targets, such as core ASD symptoms and features of caregiver-child interactions.  Fundamental gaps in our knowledge therefore remain on the validity of NDBI treatment targets,  especially in multi-cultural  settings. In addition, objectively assessing NDBI response is a  significant challenge. 'Gold standard' tools are costly, require trained professionals, and may not  be culturally valid. MHealth tools that assess ASD biomarkers may help address this challenge by  enabling point-of-care detection by non-specialists. Efforts to implement NDBIs in multi-cultural  community settings is increasing worldwide. Alongside these efforts, it is crucial to ensure that  our treatment targets are valid and that we can measure treatment response. The R21 builds upon  work conducted in an NIMH-funded K01 (PI: Franz). In the first study of its kind on the African  continent, Dr Franz has adapted a caregiver-coaching NDBI for delivery by non-specialists, and  'gold standard' clinical outcomes as well as implementation outcomes are being assessed. The R21  aims to extend this work by evaluating NDBI treatment targets and a novel digital outcome measure  of treatment response, following 12 sessions of NDBI-informed caregiver coaching, delivered by  non-specialists in South Africa. South Africa, a multi-cultural nation marked by health  disparities, is an innovative study location because it provides a unique opportunity to assess  feasibility and impact of a scalable intervention, in an environment with significant contextual  challenges. The R21 is a joint project between Duke University and the University of Cape Town  (UCT). While all research activities will be conducted in Cape Town, South Africa, ASD clinical  research capacity building will include both UCT and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) in  Tanzania, via a South-to-South collaboration. Both sites are included in order to prepare our team  to develop an R01 application for a regionally-focused randomized ASD early intervention clinical  trial, which will include sites in both South Africa and Tanzania and allow for further refinement  of innovative clinical outcome measures. Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral lnterventions (NDBls), an evidence-based early autism  spectrum disorder intervention approach, target key behaviors that help language development.

"Pharmacogenetic determinants of opioid addiction maintenance treatment with buprenorphine in a Caribbean Hispanic Population Abstract: Pharmacogenetic determinants of opioid addiction maintenance treatment with buprenorphine in a Caribbean Hispanic Population Abstract: The opioid use disorder epidemic resulted in over 60,000 overdose deaths in the United States in 2017. Currently guidelines recommend a combination of pharmacologic maintenance treatment (usually with methadone or buprenorphine) and psychosocial treatment. Recently, the use of buprenorphine for opioid use disorder has increased dramatically, partly due to fewer barriers to administration when compared to methadone. Nonetheless, variability in patient response to buprenorphine may lead some patients to fail treatment. In addition to clinical characteristics such as sex and concurrent medications that affect patient variability in response to buprenorphine, genetic variability may be a factor in the complex phenotype of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction. Although specific pharmacogenes (OPRM1, OPRD1, UGT2B7, and CYP3A4) have been identified that may contribute to the response of buprenorphine, there is a paucity of data in Hispanic populations. This addressable oversight is of great concern, since it will tend to exacerbate existing healthcare disparities that already exist affecting Hispanics with regards to the treatment of addiction.This pilot project aims to better understand the pharmacogenetic variables which affect the individual patient’s clinical response to buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder. By measuring buprenorphine plasma levels and clinical indicators of treatment response, we will perform a candidate gene association study to better understand how relevant pharmacogenes affect outcomes in a Caribbean Hispanic population being treated for opioid use disorder. The long-term goal of this research is to develop Caribbean Hispanic-oriented DNA-guided approach to treatment for opioid use disorder. Pharmacogenetic determinants of opioid addiction maintenance treatment with buprenorphine in a Caribbean Hispanic Population Narrative: In this project, we are studying the pharmacogenetic variants that determine a patient’s response to buprenorphine. By measuring the plasma levels of buprenorphine and treatment outcomes for patients being treated for opioid use disorder, we will describe the association between these clinical outcomes and a patient’s individual genetic makeup. Ultimately, this research will help us develop individualized, personalized medicine approaches to the treatment of opioid use disorder.",Pharmacogenetic determinants of opioid addiction maintenance treatment with buprenorphine in a Caribbean Hispanic Population,9855622,SC2DA052099,"['Affect ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Familiarity ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' UGT2B7 ', ' UGT2B9 ', ' UGT2B7 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' CP34 ', ' CYP3 ', ' CYP3A ', ' CYP3A4 ', ' Cytochrome P450 3A4 ', ' Cytochrome P450, Subfamily IIIA, Polypeptide 4 ', ' Cytochrome P450PCN1 ', ' FAMILY III P450 ', ' Glucocorticoid-Inducible P450 ', ' Nifedipine Oxidase ', ' P450C3 ', ' P450PCN1 ', ' Steroid-Inducible P450- III ', ' CYP3A4 gene ', ' genetic association ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' overdose death ', ' screening ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' genetic make-up ', ' genetic makeup ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' genotyped patients ', ' individual patient ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' buprenorphine treatment ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' patient variability ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,SC2,2020,149841,0.031231402707051072
"COVID-19 Neurological Georgia Cohort Study The SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses, is neurotropic. A clue to early invasion and involvement of the nervous system in COVID-19 patients are the early symptoms of anosmia and hypogeusia. These may be seen in over 60% of COVID-19 positive patients. There is evidence from the humanized ACE2 transgenic mouse that the SARS-CoV-1 virus rapidly invades the olfactory bulb and spreads transneuronally throughout the olfactory pathways Our overall goal is to determine if there are long term neurological sequelae to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection in both asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients and to understand the contributing health and genetic factors. To achieve this goal, we will establish a longitudinal prospective cohort of COVID-19 positive patients and follow them long-term for neurological sequelae. COVID-19 preferentially affects African Americans (AA) and we will be enrolling in the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA) of Georgia where we expect about half of our patients to be AA. Our hypothesis is that long term neurological sequela will occur over time in COVID-19 positive patients and there will be clinical, racial and genetic predictors of occurrence and severity of neurological sequelae. To test this hypothesis, we will recruit 500 COVID-19 positive patients at baseline and conduct follow-up annually. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Determine if COVID-19 positive patients have an increased risk to develop neurological complications and cognitive impairment over time and if there is disparity in occurrence and severity of complications in AA. Aim 2: Determine the relative contributions of pre-existing comorbidities, the initial clinical presentation (e.g., anosmia) and genetic contributions to the development and severity of neurological complications. The technical goal of Year 1 is to recruit 500 COVID-19 positive patients for the baseline testing and conduct year 1 follow-up. The specific aims for Year 1: Aim 1. Determine the 1-year incidence rates of persistent anosmia, hypogeusia and neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e. cognition, depression and anxiety) and whether there are differences between gender, ethnicity and age groups; Aim 2. Identify the potential contributing factors (i.e. severity of the COVID-19, pre-existing health conditions, the initial clinical presentation of neurological symptoms and unhealthy lifestyles including smoking and use of alcohol and illegal drugs) to the 1-year incidence of persistent anosmia, hypogeusia and neuropsychiatric disorders. Patients who are COVID-19 positive often complain of problems with smell and taste. This may indicate that the SARSCoV-2 virus enters the brain early during infection. We will follow up 500 COVID-19 patients for one year to see if they develop thinking and memory problems and if their taste and smell improves.",COVID-19 Neurological Georgia Cohort

"Neuroendocrine Mechanisms of Risk for Trauma-Related Psychopathology in Women Project Summary The majority of Americans will experience a traumatic event during their lifetimes, but women are twice as likely as men to experience negative psychiatric outcomes following trauma such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The reason for the increased prevalence in women is unclear, partially because of the historical lack of investigation of females in both human and pre-clinical animal research. In the proposed research, we will investigate the role of sex hormones in contributing to women's risk for PTSD. The gonadal hormone estradiol (E2) has previously been associated with emotion regulation and fear extinction in rodent and healthy human studies, mediated by plasticity in pathways between the amygdala and regulatory inputs from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Women with PTSD show clear deficits in regulating emotional arousal, and in fear extinction learning. We will test the hypothesis that low E2 contributes to these deficits by experimentally manipulating E2, and studying its effects on fMRI measures of threat reactivity and fear extinction, in women with PTSD, trauma-exposed women without PTSD, and healthy controls. We will use a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects crossover design, with E2/placebo given to naturally-cycling women during the early follicular phase of the cycle when endogenous E2 is lowest. Participants will be randomized to E2 or placebo at the first MRI scan, and will cross over to the other condition for a second scan conducted at the same point in the subsequent menstrual cycle. Secondly, given existing observational evidence that PTSD risk/symptoms are heightened during the luteal phase, we will test this E2 administration in the luteal phase to observe whether an increase in the E2-progesterone ratio reduces PTSD symptoms and impairments in threat reactivity and fear extinction in this time of heightened risk. The research environment at Emory University School of Medicine will provide excellent support for the successful completion of the proposed research, particularly with state of the art neuroimaging facilities, a well-developed infrastructure for identifying participants at risk for trauma and PTSD through the Grady Trauma Project, and a strong community of experts in trauma, neuroendocrine, neuroimaging, and women's health research. Findings from this study may aid in the development of new treatments and interventions to increase women's mental health outcomes following trauma. Project narrative Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most universal and severe psychiatric disorders whose incidence continues to rise due to the common exposure to severe trauma in the United States and worldwide. Women are more vulnerable than men to negative psychiatric outcomes following trauma, with twice the incidence of PTSD and mood disorders. Identifying hormonal contributors to PTSD vulnerability in women will help to bridge this health disparity.",Neuroendocrine Mechanisms of Risk for Trauma-Related Psychopathology in

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging

"Sex and stress: effects on the brain - gut axis PROJECT SUMMARY  Women display higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders, including functional dyspepsia (FD), and report a higher severity of dyspeptic symptoms compared to men. Although physiological mechanisms that mediate this sex disparity in gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are not fully understood, it has been suggested that they may be mediated by circulating estrogen.  Gastric motility is modulated by neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) and the activity of these neurons is regulated by a robust tonic GABAergic input. Estrogen has been shown to increase GABA expression and release in several regions of the central nervous system (CNS), as well as to modulate neuronal morphology and synaptic activity.  Based on our preliminary studies that indicate an estrogen-dependent modulation of vagal output to the stomach, we will test the following novel hypothesis: “Functional gastrointestinal disorders are increased in severity and incidence in females due, in part, to an estrogen mediated decrease in vagal outflow to the stomach”. To investigate this novel hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological, behavioral, chemogenetic, and anatomical approaches in a rodent model aimed at interrogating the role of stress and estrogen on the brain-gut axis.  The results of the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide a deeper understanding of the cellular and neural mechanisms by which estrogen influences the etiology of FD, help identify potential targets for more effective therapeutic interventions directed specifically towards women, and provide novel insights into changes in GI functions that occur in the perimenopausal period. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Functional gastrointestinal motility disorders (FGID) are common conditions that account for a large proportion of consultations with primary care and specialist physicians. Since women display slower gastric transit, and report a higher incidence and increased severity of FGID, it has been suggested that they are mediated by circulating estrogen. In the present proposal we will use a rodent model in which we will investigate the role of estrogen in determining the resilience or exacerbation that underlie the sex differences in gastric-related neural pathways. Our purpose is to identifying potential targets for more effective therapeutic interventions that can be directed specifically towards women, and to provide novel insights into changes in gastric functions that occur in the perimenopausal period.",Sex and stress: effects on the brain - gut axis,9959453,R01DK120170,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Consultations ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' CRF-41 ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyspepsia ', ' Indigestion ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Female ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Gastric Emptying ', ' stomach emptying ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Motility ', ' Gastrointestinal Transit ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Nuclear Envelope ', ' Nuclear Membrane ', ' Oxytocin ', ' Ocytocin ', ' Recombinant Oxytocin ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Stress ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' 5-Oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide ', ' Protirelin ', ' Protyreline ', ' Pyr-His-ProNH2 ', ' Thyroid-Releasing Hormone ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Receptors ', ' GABA Receptor ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Severities ', ' irritation ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' gastrointestinal function ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders ', ' Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus ', ' dorsal motor nucleus ', ' experience ', ' receptor expression ', ' dysmotility ', ' dysmotility syndrome ', ' motility disorder ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' patch clamp ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Perimenopausal ', ' peri-menopausal ', ' peri-menopause ', ' Perimenopause ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Slice ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' resilience ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Neonatal ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' sensory input ', ' DREADDs ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' gut to brain axis ', ' gut-brain communication ', ' gut-brain interactions ', ' gut-brain relationship ', ' gut-brain signaling ', ' gut-brain axis ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,344925,0.0198124589269143
"Effectiveness and Implementation of a Mindfulness Intervention for Depressive Symptoms Among Low-income, Racial/Ethnic Minority Adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center The objective of this R01 (PA-16-160) application is to examine the clinical effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention on reducing depressive symptoms among socio-economically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic minority adults and explore factors related to implementation in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). This research will be used to develop a generalizable model for delivery of streamlined mental health interventions in community based settings that will be broadly disseminated and scalable to other populations. Black and Hispanic adults are more likely than those who are White to receive depression treatment in primary care, where antidepressants are the most commonly offered treatment. However, Black and Hispanic adults are less likely than Whites to find antidepressants acceptable. A mindfulness depression intervention provided within primary care may be more accessible and acceptable for low-income, racial/ethnic minority individuals, a severely underserved population. Accumulating research suggests that mindfulness interventions reduce the inflammatory response that can be triggered by stress and improves psychological outcomes. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the clinical effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention (M-Body) on reducing depressive symptoms, compared to usual care, among low-income racial/ethnic minority adults in a FQHC. In preliminary studies, women ages 18-65 with depressive symptoms were recruited from a FQHC to participate in the 8-week, 90 minute per session M-Body intervention. The M-Body intervention is based on Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and has been tailored for the FQHC setting and patient population. Data from four pilot groups led by the PI (N=31) and FQHC health educator (N=41) provide evidence of acceptability, feasibility and improved depressive symptom and stress outcomes over time. Adults (N=330) with depressive symptoms will be recruited from a FQHC in the Chicago, IL area that serves majority racial/ethnic minority individuals (90%) living at or below the poverty line (74%). Half of the patients will be randomized to the M-Body intervention arm where they will receive 8-weeks of mindfulness training led by FQHC staff and the other half will be randomized to usual care. Information on factors relevant to implementation of the intervention in the FQHC will be obtained by convening a series of workgroups and individual interviews with FQHC staff, executive leadership and community stakeholders. Specific Aims: 1) Determine the effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention (M-Body) on reducing depressive symptoms compared to enhanced usual care for racial/ethnic minority adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC); 2) Explore potential mediators (stress related biomarkers, mindfulness) and moderators (age, personal, social, environmental stressors) of the intervention's effect; 3) Conduct a broad assessment of organizational and individual agency factors related to preparation and implementation of the M-Body intervention in a FQHC using a mixed methods approach. Mindfulness based interventions for depression delivered in Federally Qualified Health Centers are a promising approach to providing accessible and acceptable mental health treatment to underserved populations in community based settings. This study will examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention on reducing depressive symptoms among socio-economically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic minority adults and explore factors related to implementation in a FQHC. The findings will be used to develop a generalizable model of delivering streamlined mental health interventions in community settings that can be scalable to wider populations.","Effectiveness and Implementation of a Mindfulness Intervention for Depressive Symptoms Among Low-income, Racial/Ethnic Minority Adults in a Federally Qualified Health Center",9893027,R01MD012236,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' instructor ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' mind body approach ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body wellness ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' daily functioning ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' emotional factor ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mindfulness ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' recruit ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,451991,-0.0020673810491324465
"A Latin American biobank for large-scale genetics research on severe mental illness PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed project will develop and make available to the scientific community the Latin American Biobank of Severe Mental Illness (LAB-SMI). This resource, a databank and biobank (including DNA samples and both phenotypic and genotypic data) for 50,000 individuals affected with SMI together with an equal number of controls matched to the cases by age, gender, and geographical location will constitute a major step in reversing the underrepresentation of Latin American populations in psychiatric genetics research. All of the participants will be members of the “Paisa”, a genetically and culturally homogenous population that is the predominant ethnic group in a region of Colombia (CO) that is home to ~9M people. Cases will consist of individuals affected with psychotic or mood disorders who will be ascertained, agnostic to diagnosis, through the electronic medical records (EMR) of five large psychiatric hospitals in the “Paisa region”. Controls will be individuals without a history of an SMI diagnosis who will be ascertained through the databases of SURA, one of the largest providers of primary care services in this region. By extracting a wide range of information from the EMR, using methods developed in an existing investigation of SMI in a single Paisa-region hospital, the project team will record lifetime designations of an SMI diagnosis and the presence or absence of SMI-related symptoms (such as delusions) and behaviors (such as suicide attempt). It is hypothesized that these phenotypic features may share genetic causation that transcends diagnostic categories. SNP genotyping and whole exome sequencing studies of the entire 100K LAB-SMI will be well powered to identify novel associations across the allele frequency spectrum for SMI diagnoses, symptoms, and behaviors, and to help identify the causal variation responsible for previously discovered associations. Additionally, the project will use the LAB-SMI databank to explore the architecture of SMI phenotypes. Specifically, it will investigate the genetic basis of different disease trajectories, and mine the full set of phenotype data for association with loci shown previously (through this project or others) to contribute to SMI diagnoses, symptoms, or behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latin American descended populations, which constitute the fastest growing ethnicity in the United States, are poorly represented in psychiatric genetics research. We will reverse this underrepresentation, accelerating discoveries and reducing health disparities by creating the Latin American Biobank for Severe Mental Illness (LAB-SMI), consisting of 50,000 SMI cases and 50,000 population controls ascertained by screening electronic medical records (EMR) from the Paisa region of Colombia.

"Exploring minorities The Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site of Miami PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in science and technology are now making tackling of rare and undiagnosed disorders possible. By utilizing these advances, along with scientific and clinical expertise, the Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) promises improvement in the lives of individuals and their families affected with undiagnosed disorders. To benefit from this effort, the nation as a whole, especially the rich and rapidly increasing diversity of the US population must be taken into account. With its longstanding excellence in clinical care and research in South Florida, University of Miami is in an unsurpassed position to be a part of the UDN. We propose to create the Clinical Site-Miami (CS-Miami), which will recruit, evaluate, and provide data from participants with undiagnosed disorders. While we will be open to all participants from any location, we will specifically focus on South Florida. The diverse population of South Florida includes Hispanics from the Caribbean (e.g. Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic), Mexico, South and Central America, Caribbean born blacks, Jews and others from all over the world. Many of these minorities are recent immigrants whose original populations are ideal for the occurrence of rare diseases due to isolation, inbreeding, and founder effects. Our Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) is the only member of the national CTSA consortium co-funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) to specifically focus on the health of underrepresented minorities. To represent the minority populations, we are one of the recruitment sites for NIH`s AllofUs Precision Medicine Initiative, again, with a focus of enrolling >50% of minority participants. We will build CS-Miami upon existing expertise in community engagement, electronic medical records, biorepositories, phenotypic delineation of rare diseases, characterization of their underlying biology, and access to a large collaboration network. Specific aims will be to 1) recruitment, enroll, and engage minorities into CS-Miami; 2) characterize rare and undiagnosed disease phenotypes; 3) to reach a diagnosis via collaborative analysis of standard data. Our team's combined expertise in clinical assessment, patient engagement, informatics, ethics and genomics will provide the requisite oversight and structure to ensure we meet our stated goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to create the Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site-Miami (CS-Miami), which will evaluate and provide data from over 120 participants with various undiagnosed diseases. Our team's combined expertise in genetics and genomics, sensory disorders, development of robust biorepositories, outreach and ethics will help ensure that the required regulatory, governance and

"NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY PLUS CLINICAL SITE Project Summary Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common in women and negatively impact activities of daily living and quality of life, resulting in medical and psychological morbidity and enormous economic burden. Because of the deleterious consequences of LUTS on women, understanding optimal bladder health is essential. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of women with urinary symptoms, transdisciplinary research is needed to screen for risk factors for the development of bladder symptoms, protective factors that facilitate optimized bladder health, and mechanisms to target for prevention programs to disrupt causal pathways to bladder symptoms To date, the literature on LUTS has mostly focused on non-Hispanic White women with health insurance who present with symptoms and are already engaged with the healthcare system. Thus, extant prevention and treatment approaches are not generalizable to vulnerable populations like minority and underserved women. Significant gaps remain in understanding bladder health for minority and underserved women, where significant health disparities exist. Well-designed longitudinal cohort studies of urinary symptoms in diverse samples in which racial/ethnic minorities are well represented are severely lacking. Consistent with the PLUS Research Consortium, our objective is to move beyond the absence of symptoms and optimize bladder health as “a complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being related to bladder function.” Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to assess the influence of biological, psychosocial (mind/behavior), interpersonal, institutional, environmental, and societal factors on bladder health among diverse women using qualitative and quantitative approaches within the PLUS framework. The mixed- methods approach of this project includes: Specific Aim 1. Conduct a longitudinal, observational study of bladder health in a diverse cohort of adolescent and adult women with respect to race/ethnicity, age, income, education, health literacy, insurance status, sexual orientation, and employment, Specific Aim 2. Determine factors and behaviors that influence bladder health in diverse women, and Specific Aim 3. Create a screening tool for bladder health that is reliable and valid across diverse women. We hypothesize that social determinants of health, implicit bias, and discrimination will be significantly related to the trajectory of bladder health and engagement with the healthcare system over time for LUTS. We also hypothesize that the screener we develop will assess bladder health in all women (including diverse populations in which disparities exist) and will identify women at risk for future bladder symptoms with high reliability, validity, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and minimal burden to the respondent. The impact of this U01 will be the curation of a novel knowledge base on risk and protective factors in diverse populations of women. Our proposal seeks to reduce women's health disparities by investigating bladder health across diverse populations. Our multidisciplinary team will work together to use both qualitative and quantitative methods to understand factors that predict bladder health over time. This research will set a strong foundation for prevention trials in diverse populations of women to improve quality of life across the lifespan.",NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY PLUS CLINICAL SITE,10054068,U01DK126045,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Psychologist ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Gynecologist ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Letters ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' Medical center ', ' lower urinary tract symptoms ', ' experience ', ' physical state ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Societal Factors ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' health literacy ', ' social wellbeing ', ' Social Well-Being ', ' Minority ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' longitudinal design ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' Prevention trial ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' community partnership ', ' implicit bias ', ' common symptom ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2020,299835,0.0771332744804445
"Using Tools in Translational Neuroscience to Study Sex-linked Factors Related to PTSD Risk PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a maladaptive and debilitating psychiatric disorder precipitated by exposure to a traumatic event. The differential risk for developing PTSD is multi-determined, but in part depends on sex, with women having approximately twice the risk as men. Since sex disparities in PTSD prevalence remain after controlling for environmental factors, such as the type of trauma exposure, there is a critical need to understand biological factors associated with female PTSD vulnerability. Our long-term goal is to use translational tools in psychophysiology to gain better insight into biological factors contributing to heightened PTSD risk in women. Fear learning processes underlie the pathogenesis and maintenance of PTSD, and fear extinction processes model exposure therapy – a key treatment for PTSD. Growing evidence points to an important role of the sex hormone, estrogen, in women's heightened PTSD risk through its modulatory effects on fear learning and extinction. Yet, there is a historical dearth of preclinical research examining sex-related variables, such as the female reproductive cycle and fluctuating estrogen levels, in laboratory fear conditioning models. Also, little is known about the role of another key sex hormone, progesterone, on these processes. Even fewer studies examined hormonal contraceptive (HC) effects, a critical area of study, given evidence that 85% of women in the United States will use HCs at some point in their lifetime. Hence, the clinical translation of existing research on sex-linked factors related to fear learning and memory remain unclear. For our Aim 1, we will address these critical gaps by examining modulating roles of estradiol and progesterone on fear learning and extinction processes among naturally cycling women compared to women using HCs. In addition to maladaptive fear learning and memory, PTSD has been characterized by overgeneralization of trauma-related stimuli or situations, which may lead to sustained anxiety to nonspecific threats. While sex differences have been explored in fear conditioning to a specific threat, there is far less research on sex differences using animal models of anxiety to nonspecific threat. Also, the interplay of stress and sex hormone modulation in PTSD is not well understood in these models. Our Aim 2 will address this enormous gap in the literature by determining for the first time the relationship between sex hormone levels and dark-enhanced startle – a laboratory model of anxiety to a nonspecific threat – in women at varying stages of their menstrual cycle compared to women using hormonal contraceptives and men. Based on prior research and our own preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that gonadal hormone levels will confer either reduced fear or resiliency (when levels are high) or heightened fear or vulnerability (when levels are low) in conditioned fear and anxiety, which may partially explain disproportionate risk among women. By using translational animal models of PTSD to address these critical scientific gaps, this proposed study could yield clinically useful insights that inform more effective intervention and treatment outcomes for PTSD in women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and costly psychiatric disorder that affects twice as many women as men (10% of women and 4% of men), but biological underpinnings related to heightened female risk for developing this disorder remain unknown. Thus, finding tools to mitigate PTSD symptoms is of vital importance to mental health research. The long-term goal of this project is to use translational neuroscience models of learned fear and anxiety to develop clinically useful tools to treat unwanted, persistent, and intrusive memories associated with PTSD.",Using Tools in Translational Neuroscience to Study Sex-linked Factors Related to PTSD Risk,10114763,R15MH125303,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Progesterone ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' sex steroid ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' learning extinction ', ' Measurement ', ' Gonadal Hormones ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Salivary ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' hormonal contraceptive ', ' hormonal contraception ', ' cost ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' Ovarian Steroid Hormone ', ' preclinical research ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' undergraduate research ', ' traumatic event ', ' anxiety-related behavior ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' clinical translation ', ' translational impact ', ' translational model ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIMH,KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2020,406312,0.004825514678181445
"Quality of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in Medicaid-enrollees: The Effects of State Policies and Intiatives Project Summary Opioid use disorders are a significant public health crisis, and medication treatment is the most effective intervention for individuals with opioid use disorder. State policies and initiatives have increased medication treatment utilization over the last decade, but increased utilization without attention to quality of care might limit the public health benefits of medication treatment. Many states have begun implementing policies and initiatives to improve quality, although with little empirical support of their effectiveness in real world settings. This project will characterize how quality care for Medicaid-enrollees receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder and related health outcomes have changed over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations. We will then examine the extent to which policies and initiatives that increase access and those aimed at improving quality are associated with better quality of care and related health outcomes, overall, and for historically underserved and high-risk populations Project Narrative This project will characterize how medication treatment (MT) use, quality, and related health outcomes for Medicaid-enrollees with opioid use disorders has changed over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations.

"Opioid Treatment Adoption in Primary Care Settings: Barriers and Facilitators to Implementation Project Summary/Abstract There are more than 2 million Americans with opioid use disorder (OUD), contributing to unprecedented levels of overdoses and drug-related mortality in the U.S. Several approved medications for OUD (MOUD) are available, and robust evidence shows them to be more effective than abstinence or psychosocial therapy alone in helping individuals achieve and maintain remission. Yet, less than 20% of individuals with OUD receive any MOUD. Buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT) holds significant potential to increase access to treatment as the only MOUD available in a primary care setting that does not require patients to endure withdrawal. Fewer than 7% of physicians prescribe the drug, and more than 40% of U.S. counties do not have a BMT provider, with access further restricted in rural and otherwise underserved areas. It seems that provider-, patient-, and system-level barriers are fueling an “implementation chasm” between the evidence-based practice for OUD and its actual delivery. The objective of this application for a NIDA Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to support a new assistant professor in the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health to become a national leader in pioneering innovative, multilevel research on how to close this implementation chasm and reduce drug-related harms and inequities in those harms. To that end, this K01 application provides training opportunities in Implementation Science, spatial analysis, qualitative methods, and addiction medicine. The research aims are designed to reinforce these new skills, using mixed methods and a conceptual model derived from Implementation Science (i.e., the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Diffusion of Innovations theoretical model) to investigate the modifiable barriers and facilitators to BMT adoption in primary care. Aim 1 uses spatial analysis to develop annual, county-level measures of OUD and BMT treatment availability and determine the local correlates of unmet treatment need, both overall and for disparity populations. Aim 2 observes the diffusion of BMT prescribing among primary care providers, measuring the significant predictors of BMT adoption, including individual-, practice-, system-, and community-level factors. Aim 3 will identify “positive deviant” counties—i.e., those with substantial increases in BMT prescribing over time—and conduct in-depth qualitative case studies to determine the processes associated with successful BMT implementation and sustainment, including novel models of care and local adaptations of best practices. These studies will provide actionable recommendations for communities and health systems seeking to increase access to evidence-based care for OUD. The protected time, resources, and mentorship available through this K01 award will enable Dr. Yarbrough to emerge as an independent and leading researcher in substance use disorders and Implementation Science who will help close the implementation chasm for MOUD treatments and improve outcomes for opioid use disorder patients. Project Narrative Despite the ongoing opioid crisis and the availability of effective medications that help individuals with opioid use disorder maintain remission, few health care providers prescribe these treatments, leading to inadequate access to care for patients, especially in rural and other underserved communities. This application will support a new investigator seeking to conduct research that examines the full continuum of dissemination, implementation, and sustainment of substance use disorder treatment, with the goal of identifying effective strategies for aligning the evidence base with actual treatment received by patients. The K01 award will provide mentorship and rich opportunities for developing new research skills and knowledge, enabling the investigator to transition to an independent researcher who will lead national efforts to improve treatment access, reduce drug-related harms, and decrease inequities in access and outcomes.",Opioid Treatment Adoption in Primary Care Settings: Barriers and Facilitators to Implementation,10041254,K01DA051696,"['Adoption ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Communities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Overdose ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sales ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Rural ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' professor ', ' Maintenance Therapy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Portraits ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' waiver ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescription opioid ', ' training opportunity ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' Formulation ', ' improved outcome ', ' rurality ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid mortality ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' provider barriers ', ' provider-level barriers ', ' system-level barriers ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,178800,-0.02774660480028222
"Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: From Bench to Bedside PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Women and men are at different risks for disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan from development through aging and have critical implications for therapeutic efficacy. However, many of the mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's health and sex differences who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding differential incidences of disorders important for the health of women and how it differs from men. The program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, including the child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Division of Women's Health at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and the Women, Heart and Brain Global Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Research Institute, are the home sites for this endeavor, in the broader context of a Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women's health and sex differences with mentors across Harvard institutions: BWH, MGH, Beth Israel- Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each BIRCWH scholar is assigned a team of mentors to operationalize translational thinking. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, coursework and readings, depending on the scholar's interests. Career Mentors advise scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose scholars to thinking about how the roles of hormones and genes in affected morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on disorders with higher incidence and/or differential expression in women than men including: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard and our 14-year successful BIRCWH history, Harvard is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that will continue to train the next generation of leaders in women's health and sex differences in medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although there are significant sex differences in the expression and onset of major medical and psychiatric disorders, clinical decisions based on research are primarily based on data from men and may often be inappropriate for women. Thus, there remains a strong need for the Harvard BIRCWH program to educate, train, and develop junior investigators who will commit their careers to studying the impact of sex and gender on clinical disorders. Our Harvard BIRCWH program will provide the basis for the development of sex- dependent treatment approaches and public awareness of the importance of these sex-dependent health issues for families and society.",Hormones and Genes in Women's Health: From Bench to Bedside,9938066,K12HD051959,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Boston ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career advancement ', ' career transition ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Genes ', ' Heart ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Israel ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menopause ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Puberty ', ' Reading ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Training Programs ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Endocrine ', ' interest ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' bear children ', ' bearing children ', ' childbearing ', ' child bearing ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bedside ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NICHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K12,2020,647995,0.058356929910395317
"Developing a Culturally-Sensitive Eating Disorders Measure for South Asian American Women PROJECT SUMMARY Eating disorders (EDs) are serious psychiatric illnesses that are associated with high physical and psychological impairment, morbidity and mortality, and comorbid psychopathology. Despite similar ED prevalence estimates, South Asians (SAs), individuals descending from the subcontinent of India, including Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and the Maldives, are less likely to be assessed, referred, or treated for an ED relative to their White counterparts. Additionally, when SA women do present for treatment, they usually wait until their symptoms are severe enough to cause physical complications, and they are more likely to be dismissed by health providers relative to their White peers. These disparities can be attributed, in part, to methodological challenges related to ED assessment in SAs. The few studies conducted with SAs have primarily utilized Western diagnostic tools that were normed and validated with White, European women, limiting generalizability to SA communities. Because these instruments do not capture symptoms and constructs relevant to SA women's experiences of EDs, our current understanding of the manifestations and prevalence of these conditions within this population is potentially inaccurate. To remedy this issue, this application will culturally-adapt and modify the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) for SA women living in the United States. This work will improve identification of EDs in this underserved group, and, in the long-term, could be used to facilitate health providers' assessment of SA women. In sum, the proposed tool will serve as the necessary steppingstone for advancing understanding of the classification of ED presentations among SAs. PROJECT NARRATIVE South Asians are less likely to be screened, referred, and treated for eating disorders, although they experience these serious health conditions at rates similar to those of their White counterparts. Available eating disorder assessment tools do not adequately capture cultural nuances in the presentation of eating psychopathology in South Asians. This study will culturally-adapt the Eating Disorder Examination- Questionnaire (EDE-Q) to improve the classification of eating disorders amongst South Asian women living in the United States, with the goals of: (a) providing more accurate estimates of the true prevalence of eating disorders and, (b) enhancing understanding of the presentation and cultural variation in these health conditions in this underserved group.",Developing a Culturally-Sensitive Eating Disorders Measure for South Asian American Women,10068799,F31MD015679,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bhutan ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' India ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Maldives ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nepal ', ' Pakistan ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Sri Lanka ', ' Ceylon ', ' statistics ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Custom ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Binge eating disorder ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' cultural competence ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' Sum ', ' South Asian ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' eating pathology ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' screening ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37243,0.05305410998012521
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders.

"Developing a Pediatrics-based Social Needs Intervention to Reduce Disparities in ADHD Outcomes for Low-income Children PROJECT SUMMARY. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic conditions in childhood, with significantly higher rates and worse outcomes among socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Social adversities including unmet basic needs such as food insecurity, housing instability, and lack of quality child care emerge as potent risk factors for ADHD symptoms as early as the preschool years. The development of early intervention strategies for young children with both ADHD and socioeconomic disadvantage is critical for mitigating future impairment. New research demonstrates that a low intensity, family-centered screening and referral program (WE CARE) at well infant visits is feasible and can increase receipt of resources for unmet social needs (e.g. food, transportation, and parent education). Adapting this strategy to target preschoolers with emerging ADHD, who are typically first identified in primary care, could significantly impact clinical symptoms and disease trajectory during a critical developmental period. Therefore, the objective of this project is develop an early intervention strategy, adapted from the WE CARE program, targeting unmet social needs for low-income families of preschool-age children with emerging ADHD. The WE CARE intervention will be adapted on 3 key domains (for a new target population, content, and primary outcomes) through the pursuit of 3 interrelated studies. These are: 1) Examine the association between specific unmet social needs and ADHD symptoms in 7,565 nationally representative children age 3-5 from the National Survey for Children's Health (NSCH) and explore potential mediators of this association (including parental stress, activation, and unmet need for care) via structural equation modeling (SEM); 2) Identify parent-reported mechanisms by which unmet social needs exacerbate ADHD symptoms in preschool age children and how an intervention addressing these needs could improve clinical outcomes by conducting semi-structured interviews with 25 parents of preschoolers with ADHD symptoms; and 3) Conduct an adaptive, randomized pilot trial of a novel treatment model addressing unmet social needs with parents of 60 low-income children age 3-5 with ADHD symptoms. This research plan reflects Objective 3.2 of the NIMH Strategic Plan, to develop ways to tailor existing and new interventions to optimize outcomes, and addresses an urgent need to reduce socioeconomic disparities in pediatric mental health outcomes by targeting modifiable risk factors in vulnerable young children. These research aims will also serve as vehicles for pragmatic learning of the following training goals: 1) Learn advanced statistical modeling and measurement methods for social determinants research; 2) Gain expertise in intervention development to reduce mental health disparities; and 3) Obtain training in modern clinical trial design for the study of psychosocial and health services interventions. This mentored K23 award will facilitate Dr. Spencer's long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator developing novel interventions to reduce socioeconomic inequities in pediatric psychiatric outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE ADHD is one of the most common chronic illnesses in childhood, with a general prevalence of 5-10%, and disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Preschool ADHD onset is associated with worse illness and treatment-emergent side effects, and socioeconomic adversity increases the likelihood of treatment non-response and future morbidity in young children. Interventions addressing unmet social needs in preschoolers with ADHD symptoms could significantly reduce socioeconomic disparities in ADHD persistence and outcomes.",Developing a Pediatrics-based Social Needs Intervention to Reduce Disparities in ADHD Outcomes for Low-income Children,10005474,K23MH118478,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Special Education ', ' remedial/special education ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' School Enrollments ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Psychiatric Social Work ', ' Psychiatric Social Service ', ' psychosocial service ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Inferior ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' preference ', ' Arwin ', ' Arvin ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial support ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Symptoms ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pilot trial ', ' instably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' unstably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' service intervention ', ' collaborative care ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' primary outcome ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' Child Health ', ' food insecurity ', ' side effect ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2020,163137,0.057921703048544056
"DiSCERN: Advanced PD Therapy Candidacy and Evaluation System Summary  The objective is to design, develop, and clinically assess DiSCERN, a standardized telemedicine tool for identifying patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) who would benefit from advanced therapies (AT) and determining when AT recipients need therapy adjustments. Once chronic PD medication usage results in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias and all non-invasive therapies have been exhausted, AT (e.g., deep brain stimulation, drug pumps) is often recommended. While experts at academic medical centers may appropriately identify AT candidates, AT is underutilized due to limited access and inequitable utilization of limited evaluative resources for a sizable subset of the PD population. Remote screening and monitoring with DiSCERN will improve patient selection, reduce disparities, and expand access for rural populations and disadvantaged communities. The system will engage and empower patients, providers, and healthcare institutions and lead to improved health, healthcare delivery, and the reduction of health disparities. This mobile health technology will include a patient friendly smartphone app, non-motor assessments, and wireless wearable sensors for continuously monitoring PD motor symptoms, complications, and quality of life (QoL). We have previously commercialized wearables and mobile apps for remote monitoring of PD motor symptoms and side effects, which will significantly de-risk the project. Still, novel development and validation efforts are required to commercialize this new technology. Innovations include: 1) integration of PD monitoring algorithms with context aware activity detection for improved PD motor assessment and QoL quantification; 2) implementation of the algorithms on a smartphone and wearable device; 3) development of a predictive model that uses motor and non-motor features to accurately identify PD patients who would be good candidates for AT; and 4) implementation of a model that alerts clinicians when an AT recipient needs a therapy adjustment. Through integration with AT systems, DiSCERN will improve the clinician experience and allow the limited availability of specialists to scale care to a diverse and growing PD population, who may not otherwise have access to AT. Phase I includes: 1) validation of context aware activity detection algorithms on PD patient data; 2) determining the extent specific activities or activity levels correlate with PD QoL; 3) using clinician feedback to identify collected data features that are useful in informing AT clinical decisions; and 4) identification of wearables to be used in the final system. Phase II includes: 1) transition of context aware activity detection and PD symptom quantification algorithms onto a smartphone and wearable chips; 2) development of a smartphone app that integrates data collection, non-motor assessment, and data-transfer to the cloud; and 3) collecting data from AT candidates in the months before and after AT is initiated to develop models that accurately identify AT candidates and when AT adjustments are needed. DiSCERN will improve therapy efficiency, expand access, and result in more patients opting for AT. Narrative Advanced therapies such as deep brain stimulation and drug pumps are often recommended to patients with Parkinson’s disease when medication no longer provides sufficient relief of motor symptoms without causing undesirable side-effects. However, many patients do not have access to movement disorders specialty clinics and there is currently no standardized method for identifying when a patient is ready for an advanced therapy. DiSCERN will use wearable motion sensors and a smartphone app to continuously monitor motor symptoms, complications, and quality of life throughout the day during activities of daily living to identify when a patient is ready to consider an advanced therapy or recognize and notify a clinician when a patient needs a therapy adjustment.",DiSCERN: Advanced PD Therapy Candidacy and Evaluation System,9807285,R44MD013767,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dyskinetic syndrome ', ' Abnormal Movements ', ' Dyskinesias ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Levodopa ', ' L-Dopa ', ' Methods ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neurology ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' exhaust ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' motor disorder ', ' Rural ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' diaries ', ' Unnecessary Surgery ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Collection ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' Validation ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Implant ', ' product development ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' screening ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' motor symptom ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' patient screening ', ' side effect ', ' motion sensor ', ' ']",NIMHD,GREAT LAKES NEUROTECHNOLOGIES,R44,2020,651060,0.04266681142906067
"A framework enabling the genomic analysis of psychiatric traits across admixed populations. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Globally, neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading cause of disability. Despite recent advances in mental health genetics in Eurasian groups, major limitations remain in the understanding of psychiatric disorders in minority populations, in particular “admixed” groups of mixed ancestry. Due to the paucity of methodological approaches that account for their additional genomic complexity, admixed populations are systematically excluded from psychiatric genomic studies. Admixed populations, including African American and Latino individuals, make up more than a third of the US populace and have higher rates of some anxiety disorders including PTSD, yet these groups face severe disparities in mental health research and treatment due to being so sorely underrepresented in psychiatric genomics. To reap full and equitable benefits from efforts including All of Us, NeuroGAP, and the PGC, there is a pressing unmet need for the development of tools permitting the study of psychiatric traits in admixed peoples.  The candidate proposes to address this issue by developing a suite of statistical methods, software packages, and analytical resources. Dr. Atkinson will: 1a) build a tool to allow for the integration of admixed individuals into psychiatric GWAS; 1b) aggregate a significantly expanded Native American reference panel to improve genomic inference in admixed American populations; 2a) characterize the genetic basis of traits relevant to psychiatric disorders in diverse populations of the largest biobank dataset; 2b) leverage the linkage disequilibrium in admixed individuals to improve fine-mapping; and 3) develop a statistical method that generates reliable genetic risk scores for psychiatric traits in admixed subjects. These efforts fill a major gap in existing resources and will improve our understanding of psychiatric diseases in diverse groups whom medical genomics has so far failed. These efforts are in direct line with the strategic mission of the NIMH, highlighting the crucial and timely nature of the proposed project.  The proposed research and training plan were carefully designed to confer expertise in three domains: 1) phenotypes and genetic architectures of psychiatric disorders, 2) statistical methods development, and 3) professional development. These skills are fundamental to the candidate’s goal of becoming a leading investigator who develops and applies statistical genomics to understand psychiatric disorders across diverse populations. In addition to research training, Dr. Atkinson will take coursework, participate in regular seminars, attend workshops and conferences, and gain mentorship and teaching experience locally and in Africa. All research will be conducted in the Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, the Broad Institute, and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health with mentorship from renowned scientists Drs. Mark Daly and Karestan Koenen. Additional guidance from leading experts Drs. Ben Neale, Alkes Price, and Jordan Smoller will ensure exceptional guidance and support. Overall, the training environment is outstanding, the mentors and advisors are world-class, the proposed studies address an urgent unmet need, and the additional skills gained in this award will poise Dr. Atkinson to establish independent leadership in population, statistical, and psychiatric genomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders are the leading global cause of years lived with disability and affect all societies, yet there are major disparities in mental health research and treatment across ancestry groups. Specifically, “admixed” people – those whose DNA contains more than one ancestral component, including African American and Latino individuals – are systemically excluded from studies due to the lack of available methods to appropriately handle their complex genomes. In this award, I propose to bridge this concerning gap in research space by developing novel methods and tools to enable the study of complex psychiatric traits in admixed people, bettering our understanding of mental health genetics in these diverse populations who have so far been underserved.",A framework enabling the genomic analysis of psychiatric traits across admixed populations.,10022335,K01MH121659,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Americas ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Data Collection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Jordan ', ' Leadership ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' years lived with disability ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' tool development ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' translational genetics ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' population stratification ', ' genetic architecture ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' psychiatric genomics ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,185157,-0.0015296394332818576
"Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) significantly reduces the risk of hospitalizations, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increases quality of life. Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience. Our study will test use of a web-enabled app with tailored feedback that is integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record. This app is designed to improve patient-provider communication about adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits among diverse patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We will evaluate the intervention on a comprehensive set of outcomes, including rigorous measures of long-term adherence, quality of life, and costs.",Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence,10000888,R01CA218155,"['malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' mortality ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tablets ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Time Management ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Non-adherent patient ', ' Nonadherent patient ', ' Patient Non Compliance ', ' Patient Non-Adherence ', ' Patient Nonadherence ', ' Patient Noncompliance ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' web-enabled ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' 3-arm study ', ' three-arm study ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' real time monitoring ', ' side effect ', ' adherence rate ', ' Chemotherapy and Radiation ', ' Chemotherapy and/or radiation ', ' adjuvant endocrine therapy ', ' ']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,378251,0.05086204994587611
"Symptom and Healthcare Access Reporting and Evaluation (SHARE) for Supportive Care Equity PROJECT ABSTRACT Cancer patients experience many troubling symptoms during treatment, including pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. However, symptom burden is not equally shared across racial/ethnic groups, with Black cancer patients reporting greater symptom burden than their White counterparts. Such disparities in symptom burden are particularly concerning as poorly managed symptoms contribute to lower health related quality of life and worse clinical outcomes. It is also well established, across multiple studies, that minorities report worse health care access (HCA) than Whites, leading to disparities in health care outcomes. However, understanding of the contribution of multiple, co-occurring HCA challenges to health care inequities is lacking, as is evidence on the contribution of HCA to symptom burden inequities. My long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in addressing inequities in supportive cancer care (i.e., care that optimizes comfort, function, and social support across the cancer care continuum) through the use of innovative health informatics tools that address systemic barriers to care. In collaboration with my mentoring team, I have developed a training and research plan to achieve my career goal. Specifically, I will acquire intensive training in 1) structural equation modeling approaches relevant to disentangling mediators of cancer care inequities; 2) health informatics integration in clinical practice; 3) the application of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in supportive cancer care; and 4) longitudinal intervention study design and evaluation. I will leverage my career development training to identify subgroups of cancer patients with similar HCA experiences, and examine the contribution of HCA to racial differences in symptom burden in a cohort of Black and White cancer patients enrolled in the North Carolina Health Registry Cancer Survivorship Cohort. With this understanding, I will then develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of an electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO) tool designed to routinely monitor both, symptoms and HCA in a cohort of Black and White cancer patients. Existing e-PRO tools rarely collect data on HCA and, to my knowledge, have not been evaluated in racially-diverse cancer patients, potentially leading to missed opportunities for identifying and addressing access-related challenges that might underlie or exacerbate disparities in symptom burden. The rationale for this project is that routinely monitoring symptoms and symptom- relevant HCA over time will lead to more timely and patient-centered symptom management, especially among Black cancer patients who report greater symptom burden and worse HCA relative to Whites. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses a serious and understudied gap in supportive cancer care: effective strategies for mitigating racial disparities in cancer-related symptom burden. Specifically, the proposed research will elucidate the contribution of health care access inequities to racial disparities in symptom burden in order to inform the development of a novel electronic patient-reported outcome (e-PRO) tool designed to routinely monitor symptoms and symptom-relevant health care access challenges. The proposed e-PRO tool has the potential to prompt more equitable provision of supportive care services and lead to improved cancer care outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities experiencing excess symptom burden and more barriers to care.",Symptom and Healthcare Access Reporting and Evaluation (SHARE) for Supportive Care Equity,9900572,K01CA218473,"['Anxiety ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' North Carolina ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Care Team ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Summary Reports ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Insomnia ', ' Insomnia Disorder ', ' Sleeplessness ', ' Documentation ', ' cancer care ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' usability ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' clinical practice ', ' health data ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' Wait Time ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' informatics tool ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2020,160156,0.09210891819233859
"The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants of Health (SEMOARS)  during Breast Cancer Chemotherapy Project Summary Abstract Abstract: The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants (SEMOARS) Background: Black women with breast cancer in the United States have a lower 5 year survival than whites for stage-matched disease. Our past and ongoing work and that of others suggests that symptom incidence, cancer related distress and ineffective communication contribute to racial disparity in dose reduction and early therapy termination. Aims:1) Examine and compare chemotherapy received/chemotherapy prescribed over time and in total of matched black and white women prescribed BC chemotherapy. 2) Examine and compare the symptom incidence, distress and management, clinical encounter including patient centeredness of care and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy over time. 2a) Correlate the symptom incidence symptom incidence, distress and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy to Aim 1. 3) Explore the effects of social determinants of health including age, income, education, zip code and lifetime stress exposure on Aims 1, 2 and 3. Hypothesis: Inherent differences including race and possibly social determinants of health between black and white women in the experience, perception, communication and outcomes of symptoms during breast cancer chemotherapy interfere with chemotherapy adherence. Methods: Longitudinal frequent repeated-measures (18 data collections), comparative, mixed methods (audiotapes of clinic visits) descriptive design of 179 white and 179 black women from 6 sites at Western Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio over the course of chemotherapy. Innovation: The intense assessment of symptoms, distress and quality of life and the clinical encounter in multiple repeated measures as compared by race and social determinants of health on the ability to receive full dose chemotherapy is patient centered and innovative. Significance/Public Health: If these relationships and racial differences are confirmed and the mediating factors identified as actionable targets, this information will fill a critical gap in the quality care literature, advancing the understanding and potential mitigation strategies for the static racial survival disparity in breast cancer. These identified targets hold implication for public health. Project Narrative  This proposal, in response to PA-16-160, National Institute of Minority Health and Disparity (NIMHD) Research Project Grant (Parent R01) has the goal of creating an important explanatory model regarding the process of symptom experience, symptom reporting, management and symptom outcomes leading to the ability to receive full dose of prescribed therapy according to race and considering social determinants for women receiving breast cancer chemotherapy. Defining barriers to receiving full dose and timely therapeutics are an important strategy for mitigation of treatment and survival disparity in breast cancer.","The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants of Health (SEMOARS)  during Breast Cancer Chemotherapy",9928747,R01MD012245,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Audiotape ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Empathy ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Ohio ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Distress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Severities ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' cessation of treatment ', ' treatment cessation ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Process ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' chemotherapy ', ' comparative ', ' social health determinants ', ' Regimen ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' survival outcome ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' associated symptom ', ' Infrastructure ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' social inclusion ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' clinical encounter ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,652432,-0.06901114744645719
"Maternal Exposure to Childhood Abuse and Disparities in Offspring Neurodevelopment: Identifying Mechanisms Project Summary Children of women exposed to childhood abuse exhibit increased risk for a wide array of neurodevelopmental deficits, including elevated risk of anxiety, depression, and social problems. Our studies have found that these children had a more than three-fold higher risk of autism and 70% higher risk of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Animal studies similarly find that maternal exposure to stressors is associated with offspring anxiety, depressive symptoms, and attention problems and decreased social behavior. Neurodevelopmental disorders are common and carry lifelong, costly burdens. Yet, extant research has failed to identify pathways by which children of women abused are at risk of harm. Identification of such pathways is a critical step in preventing neurodevelopmental deficits in these children. The present research focuses on three likely pathways that have largely been unexamined. We will identify biological dysregulation during pregnancy in women exposed versus unexposed to abuse in two systems: hormonal function and immune function. Dysregulation in these biological systems is known to harm offspring neurodevelopment and is present in adults who have experienced childhood abuse, yet it is largely unknown whether dysregulation in these systems occurs during the pregnancies of women exposure to abuse. We will collect biological samples to measure the functioning of these systems in a large, prospective cohort of pregnant women. Second, we will examine whether women who experienced abuse carry higher genetic loading for neuropsychiatric disorders by calculating genetic risk scores for 5 disorders including autism and ADHD in more than 8000 women. Genetically informed studies indicate that genetic variation plays a role in increased risk of negative neurodevelopmental outcomes in children of women abused. However, to date no studies have used genome- wide data to address this question. Our proposed study is uniquely suited to greatly expand our understanding of how childhood abuse affects health across generations and to inform interventions to protect the healthy development of children. This information is critical to establish public health priorities and to determine the optimal type and timing of interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental harm to children. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance The proposed research will examine three biological pathways which may account for the association of maternal childhood abuse with offspring neurodevelopmental deficits: 1) endocrine dysfunction during pregnancy, 2) inflammation during pregnancy, and 3) genetic loading for neurodevelopmental disorders. Neurodevelomental deficits, including autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are major causes of disability, morbidity, and unemployment across the life course. Ascertaining the mechanisms by which mother's abuse affects offspring neurodevelopment will have a profound impact on the design of public health interventions to protect the healthy development of children, specifically: 1) identify targets for potential prenatal and perinatal interventions, 2) improve screening in prenatal and pediatric care, and 3) identify children who will benefit from early intervention.",Maternal Exposure to Childhood Abuse and Disparities in Offspring Neurodevelopment: Identifying Mechanisms,9872196,R01HD094725,"['Adrenal Glands ', ' Adrenals ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endocrine system ', ' Endocrine/Metabolic Organ System ', ' Hormonal System ', ' Metabolic/Endocrine Body System ', ' endocrine gland/system ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Morbidity -
