"URBAN/RURAL DIFFERENCES IN ELDERLY USE OF LONG-TERM CARE The purpose of this longitudinal study is to estimate and analyze differences between urban and nonurban elderly in the use of major long- term care health and community-based support services. Estimation of differences in nursing home admissions, use of home health care and other community-based support services and physician and hospital visits related to limited number of chronic conditions, will specifically focus on the differential in utilization patterns accompanying declines in health status and function. Several multivariate utilization models will be specified and estimated with data drawn from the 1984 and 1986 panels of the National Center for Health Statistics 1988 release of the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA). The LSOA, which is comprised of information on over 5,000 individuals 70 years of age and over and supplemented with data matches from the Medicare files and National Death Index, provides a unique basis for relating deterioration in health status to survival and utilization outcomes. Each of the models will appropriately adjust for differences in initial values of predisposing, enabling and need characteristics and incorporate interaction terms for assessing significant urban-nonurban behavioral differences. To control for the effects of known disparities in the distribution of health resources between urban and nonurban areas, data on physicians, nurses, and hospital and nursing home beds, assembled from the Area Resources File will be allocated according to the thirty-six geographical designations in the LSOA and merged into the LSOA's individual records. All utilization equations will be estimated with the RTILOGIT software. Utilization profiles established to compare and contrast the behavior of the two demographic groups should be of interest to health policy analysts and manpower, facility and program planners of long-term care services.

"MINORITY ELDERLY USE OF LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES The number of elderly minorities is growing faster than the elderly in general. Their lower health status, observed under-representation in nursing homes, and population growth bring about a major policy issue: minority elderly suffer from inequitable access to a major long term care (LTC) service.  Other forms of LTC such as home and community care, underestimated in the past, play an increasingly important role in the continuum of care for the functionally dependent elderly. Yet, few, if any, efforts are undertaken to compare the use of the spectrum of care for the elderly in general and minority elderly in particular.  The main aim of this project is to explain the observed differences in utilization of LTC services between minority and white elderly. This project will help identify the sources of inequity in access to LTC services for minority elderly and provides the basis for practical and valuable policy decisions.  The 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) is used to achieve this goal. NMES is a multistage, area probability survey that oversamples the minority, elderly, poor, and those with functional difficulties. The survey focuses on the utilization of LTC services.  The sample is limited to a cross-section of the elderly 65 years of age and over living in the community and in nursing homes and board and care facilities. Using Aday and Andersen's model of health care utilization and access, population characteristics such as insurance, income, attitudes towards health care, social support, and region are used to explain differences in the use of home care, community services, and nursing home use. A multi-nomial logistic regression model is used to identify which factors have the greatest impact on utilization of LTC services.

"ENHANCED DIABETES CARE African-American children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus have poorer glycemic control and markedly worse long-term outcomes than do their Caucasian counterparts. Current standard diabetes treatment programs are failing African-American children. Optimal glycemic control is critical for reducing the devastating complications of diabetes, and for improving both the duration and quality of life of diabetic individuals. There is a crucial need for effective alternate intervention strategies in African-American children and their families; these interventions must enable families to cope with barriers to diabetes care and to achieve improved glycemic control. Diabetes care in childhood is largely home based, and therefore this projects focuses on the home. As an alternative to the traditional model of diabetes care which is hospital or office based, we are proposing to establish a home-based intervention program designed to intensify diabetes management and improve glycemic control in African-American children. A key aspect of the program is that it will involve indigenous community based home health facilitators (CBHHF) as integral members of the diabetes team. These home workers will be the in- home extension of the diabetes treatment team, and act as educators and facilitators for diabetic patients and their families. They will transmit the expertise of the diabetes group in a culturally competent manner and perform the vital function of linking diabetes treatment goals to their implementation.  The study will test the hypothesis that a one year home-based intervention program will improve diabetes management in African-American children with diabetes compared with controls, and that this improvement will be sustained over the following year. Subjects (7-17 years; n=6O), recruited in metropolitan Cleveland, will be randomly assigned to the home- intervention group or to a standard care group. The home-based intervention includes home visitation by the CBHHF working with a multidisciplinary diabetes team, an incremental program for education and goal setting, and support in coping with barriers to glycemic control. The control group will receive standard clinic-based diabetes care from the same diabetes team. Glycohemoglobin levels and other indices of diabetes management in the home-based intervention group will be compared with those in the control group.  The study will also evaluate demographic and metabolic baseline measures that could be used to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from a home-based diabetes program. The significance of the proposed project is that it offers a method for correcting the disparity in blood glucose control that exists between African-American and Caucasian children.

"MEASURING AND IMPROVING QUALITY--CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure commonly performed among          the elderly to prevent stroke.  Its annual incidence is rising rapidly,          up 61 percent nationally between 1991 and 1994. Past research has                suggested significant quality problems relating to this procedure,               including: the selection of inappropriate surgical candidates, high              rates of complications in community-based studies, an inverse                    relationship between provider volume and complications, and substantial          racial disparities in use rates.  Recent studies have produced much new          data on the efficacy of this operation but few new data on quality of            care.

In the phase 1, we will study patients           treated in a group of 7 collaborating hospitals.  In phase 2, we will            conduct 2 parallel investigations.  We will study a large, stratified            random sample of about 8000 Medicare cases from across New York State,           a sample large enough to build robust models of risk-adjusted                    perioperative complications.  We will examine appropriateness, risk-             adjusted outcomes, and surgical processes of care. Attempting to                 characterize best surgical practices, we will assess the extent to which         specific surgical processes of care are associated with low rates of             risk-adjusted perioperative complications.  In addition, we will explore         the relationship of hospital and surgeon volume to risk-adjusted                 perioperative complications.

"PROJECT IMPART--RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR MINORITY STUDENTS The nursing profession traditionally has included only small numbers of individuals from minority backgrounds who are prepared at the master's level or beyond. Consequently, a significant disparity exists in the number of individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds who have the academic preparation and the professional socialization to address the health care issues of growing minority populations. Project IMPART (improving minority Professionals' Access to Research Tracks) is a program designed to increase the number of minority nurses who have the scholarly expertise to progress into research careers and to integrate advanced nursing education into their career goals. Project IMPART builds on an existing, productive relationship between a public associate degree nursing program (Community College of Philadelphia) and a private baccalaureate nursing program (Thomas Jefferson University).  It is a crucial step in providing a solution to the scarcity of minority nurse researchers. Specifically, students in Project IMPART earn credits applicable to the baccalaureate and master's degrees in nursing, work with research role models in academic and clinical settings, and access career development services. The expected outcomes of the Project are that minority students who are involved in this innovative program will 1) pursue baccalaureate and higher nursing degrees; 2) participate in research opportunities to increase awareness of health-related research issues; 3) become mentors for other minority students; and 4) initiate a research agenda designed to find solutions to health care problems commonly experienced by minority persons.

"FACILITY EFFECTS ON RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN NURSING HOME Q Although our methods for measuring quality of care in nursing homes have improved substantially, we still lack a clear understanding of how nursing home structure and local community context may influence quality of care.  We also lack an understanding of how segregation of access to nursing homes by minority elders is related to differences in quality of care received by white and minority nursing home residents.  The specific aims of this study are: 1) To quantify the extent to which access to nursing home care is segregated by race/ethnicity; 2) Using state-of-the-art indicators of care quality in long term care nursing facilities, develop a measure of racial/ethnic disparities in care quality that compares the odds of receiving poor quality care for whites and nonwhites; 3) To examine variation in and relationships between the two separate concepts of nursing home quality of care and racial/ethnic disparities in nursing home quality of care; 4) Using a smaller subset of facilities from this population that are participating in an existing panel study, to test for the effects of demographic ""mismatch"" between community and nursing home staff on racial/ethnic disparity in nursing home care quality; and 5) To develop and test a multilevel model explaining variation in nursing home quality of care as well as racial/ethnic disparities in nursing home quality of care as a function of patient level, facility level and community level factors.  We propose to use recently validated measures of care quality to develop racial/ethnic disparity measures in 6 different areas of care (pain management, pressure ulcers, depression management, use of restraints, use of antipsychotic drugs and incontinence management), and we will compare the quality of nursing home care received by whites, African Americans, Native Americans and non-white Hispanics.  The Strategic Assessment of Geriatric Drug Use and Epidemiology (SAGE) Database will provide the core data for this project on over 7000 nursing homes in seven different states, with a smaller subanalysis of 308 nursing homes from the Do Good Nursing Homes project.

"RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MEDICATION USE IN US NURSING HOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Abstract) Using individual level data on all               residents of all U.S. nursing homes in five states collected for the Health          Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Multistate Nursing Home Case-mix and            Quality Demonstration Project, we have noted in our prescribing trends studies       that minority residents are less likely to receive medically appropriate             treatments. We have also recently examined racial/ethnic disparities in U.S.         nursing home care, and have preliminary evidence to suggest that, in fact,           minority elders do not receive care of comparable quality to whites,                 controlling for differences in severity of conditions, socio-economic status         and patient preference. Although we have considered race/ethnicity as an             independent variable in analyses conducted for different purposes, we have yet       to systematically review disparities by race/ethnicity in the receipt of             medications. Identifying the extent to which individual factors may explain the      disturbing trends evaluated thus far is essential to our understanding.              Regardless we have very little understanding of how these racial/ethnic              disparities are influenced by organizational structures (specifically. facility      size, ownership, system-affiliation, and staffing patterns).                                                                                                              Using data collected from 1992-1997 including information on all                     Medicare/Medicaid recipients in 2,040 nursing homes in six states (New York,         Mississippi, South Dakota, Kansas, Ohio, and Maine), we will focus on newly          admitted residents at least 65 years of age with conditions for which                pharmacologic therapy is available. We will explore hypotheses regarding             mechanisms to explain observed disparities. In particular, we are concerned          that any racial/ethnic differences observed may not be fully explained by            racial/ethnic differences in severity of conditions, patient preference, or          social class. As suggested in the literature, provider care may be influenced        by subtle or blatant forms of racial discrimination. Thus, we have selected          conditions that are reflective of available treatments for which risk to             benefit considerations may be non-differential with respect to race/ethnicity        and also, that are unlikely to be differentially rejected by racial/ethnic           minorities because of personal preferences.                                                                                                                               The specific aims of this study are 1) to quantify racial/ethnic differences in      the receipt of medications for chronic conditions that may disproportionately        affect people of color; 2) To characterize the extent to which the disparities       in receipt of medications by race/ethnicity is modified by organizational (e.g.      ownership, level of skilled nursing staff, involvement of physicians) and            contextual (e.g. market size, urban/rural, county racial/ethnic mix, average         income county education level, income inequality); 3) To quantify the effect of      race/ethnicity on improvements in pharmacotherapy of chronic conditions among        residents living in long term care; and 4) To determine the ""consequences"" by        race/ethnicity of sub-optimal treatment of chronic conditions among residents        of long term care in the form of higher re-hospitalization rates.

By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of vulnerable research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of vulnerable populations research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center faculty will be able to address important nursing and other practice issues and deliver research results into the community. The design of the CVPR creates a unique scientific interface between biologic and behavioral researchers studying vulnerable populations and facilitates translation of research into community-based programs with implications for social policy. The CVPR will include 12 key faculty members and 12 affiliate members from nursing and other disciplines. A Scientific-Community Advisory Committee composed of renowned scientists and leaders in the community will further strengthen the Center's capabilities. UCLA School of Nursing has had a long-term commitment to improving health status outcomes of vulnerable populations through its research, clinical facilities, and educational programs.

"HOSPITAL SERVICES AREAS FOR PEDIATRICS The Dartmouth Center for Clinical and Evaluative Studies has defined the geographical boundaries for hospital service areas (HSAs) for the United States using Medicare discharge data. HSAs have proven to be invaluable for three purposes: l) discovery and description of geographic variation in hospital resources and utilization, 2)  testing hypotheses to explain the discovered variation in resources and utilization, 3) serving as a clustering variable for adjustment for correlated patients belonging to the same medical market area. Unfortunately the Medicare discharges upon which HSAs are based are almost exclusively derived from elderly patients. It has been assumed, but not demonstrated, that services areas for the elderly will suffice for pediatric data and research questions. However, compared to adults, children have a very different pattern of disease, different patterns of insurance coverage, and different patterns of hospitalization. The differences are probably even more dramatic in comparison to the elderly. Therefore research is needed to ascertain the feasibility and value of creating hospital service areas for pediatrics (HSAPs). For this exploratory project we propose to define and analyze HSAPs for a single large and diverse state, California. Our specific aims are to: l.  Define HSAPs using the Dartmouth patient origin methods, 2. Determine the relative fit of Medicare-based HSAs and the new HSAPs to patient origin data, 3. Determine if HSAPs perform better than HSAs as a clustering variable  for a typical child health services research question: What are the effects  of race, bed supply and income on asthma discharge rate? If HSAPs are found to be effective they can lead to a number of new child health services research endeavors, including creation of an atlas of pediatric health care modeled on the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, studies of the stability of HSAPs over time, aggregation of HSAPs into hospital referral regions representing tertiary care, and improved analyses of racial and socioeconomic disparities in access to health care.

"FACILITY EFFECTS ON RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN NH QUALITY Although our methods for measuring quality of care in nursing homes have improved substantially, we still lack a clear understanding of how nursing home structure and local community context may influence quality of care.  We also lack an understanding of how segregation of access to nursing homes by minority elders is related to differences in quality of care received by white and minority nursing home residents.  The specific aims of this study are: 1) To quantify the extent to which access to nursing home care is segregated by race/ethnicity; 2) Using state-of-the-art indicators of care quality in long term care nursing facilities, develop a measure of racial/ethnic disparities in care quality that compares the odds of receiving poor quality care for whites and nonwhites; 3) To examine variation in and relationships between the two separate concepts of nursing home quality of care and racial/ethnic disparities in nursing home quality of care; 4) Using a smaller subset of facilities from this population that are participating in an existing panel study, to test for the effects of demographic ""mismatch"" between community and nursing home staff on racial/ethnic disparity in nursing home care quality; and 5) To develop and test a multilevel model explaining variation in nursing home quality of care as well as racial/ethnic disparities in nursing home quality of care as a function of patient level, facility level and community level factors.  We propose to use recently validated measures of care quality to develop racial/ethnic disparity measures in 6 different areas of care (pain management, pressure ulcers, depression management, use of restraints, use of antipsychotic drugs and incontinence management), and we will compare the quality of nursing home care received by whites, African Americans, Native Americans and non-white Hispanics.  The Strategic Assessment of Geriatric Drug Use and Epidemiology (SAGE) Database will provide the core data for this project on over 7000 nursing homes in seven different states, with a smaller subanalysis of 308 nursing homes from the Do Good Nursing Homes project.

"MEASURING AND IMPROVING QUALITY: CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure commonly performed among          the elderly to prevent stroke.  Its annual incidence is rising rapidly,          up 61 percent nationally between 1991 and 1994. Past research has                suggested significant quality problems relating to this procedure,               including: the selection of inappropriate surgical candidates, high              rates of complications in community-based studies, an inverse                    relationship between provider volume and complications, and substantial          racial disparities in use rates.  Recent studies have produced much new          data on the efficacy of this operation but few new data on quality of            care.                                                                                                                                                             We propose to investigate quality of care in carotid endarterectomy in           a retrospective, multiple cohort, 2-phase study, measuring                       appropriateness, risk-adjusted complications (death, stroke, and                 myocardial infarction), and the relationship of specific surgical                processes of care to outcomes.  In the phase 1, we will study patients           treated in a group of 7 collaborating hospitals.  In phase 2, we will            conduct 2 parallel investigations.  We will study a large, stratified            random sample of about 8000 Medicare cases from across New York State,           a sample large enough to build robust models of risk-adjusted                    perioperative complications.  We will examine appropriateness, risk-             adjusted outcomes, and surgical processes of care. Attempting to                 characterize best surgical practices, we will assess the extent to which         specific surgical processes of care are associated with low rates of             risk-adjusted perioperative complications.  In addition, we will explore         the relationship of hospital and surgeon volume to risk-adjusted                 perioperative complications.  We will also assess the relationship               between race and appropriateness.                                                                                                                                 In the second part of phase 2, we will design, conduct, and evaluate a           series of quality improvement interventions at the 7 collaborating               hospitals.  With the active participation of the surgeons who perform            carotid endarterectomy at these institutions, we will examine the phase          1 data on appropriateness.  We will examine differences among                    collaborating hospitals in the surgical processes of care shown in Phase         2 to be associated with improved risk-adjusted perioperative outcomes.           We will determine at each hospital where opportunities exist to improve          both the appropriateness of patient selection and the effectiveness of           surgical processes of care, intervene to improve, and assess the impact          of those interventions.

"OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH GRADIENTS IN HOSPITAL WORKERS   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                 Socioeconomic gradients in health status are ubiquitous in space, persistent         in time, and pervasive across diverse health outcomes.  Yet little is known of       how they arise, and specifically, how great a contribution is made to them by        working conditions during adult life.  Existing occupational cohort studies,         such as the landmark Whitehall publications, have failed to convince some            observers that work-related ""psychosocial"" exposures, e.g., the degree of            control felt by employees over their jobs, constitute the key causal                 influences responsible for socioeconomic gradients in the health of the              general adult population, especially gradients in chronic disease.  Largely          missing in the debate thus far is high-quality evidence on gradients from            workplaces with a wide range of jobs -- Whitehall, for example, is                   fundamentally an office worker study.  The present proposal is premised on the       view that rich insights into the genesis of such health ""gradients"" may be           gained by studying in detail, over some years, a workplace, such as a                hospital, that has a very wide range of jobs, and of employees from different        social classes.                                                                                                                                                           By far the major ""short-term"" occupational health problem of this workforce,         and many others, is work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) -- a broad       class of outcomes including low back pain and upper extremity injuries, such         as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.  Both psychosocial and                     physical-ergonomic exposures at work are now thought to be joint determinants        of these musculoskeletal problems.  Thus, psychosocial aspects of work are           increasingly recognized as risk factors for both sorts of illness processes:         traumatic and chronic disease.  Yet there appears to be a dearth of research         linking socioeconomic and job-category disparities in the risk of WRMSDs, with       well-known gradients in many longer-term health outcomes, particularly               coronary heart disease and its risk factors (such as hypertension).  The             investigators propose a study to shed light on the nature and multi-factorial        etiology of hospital gradients, across job categories and employee social            class backgrounds, in the occurrence of several potentially work-related             health outcomes in hospitals.  The outcomes studied will be lost-time,               work-related musculoskeletal disorders, non-invasive measures of allostatic          load (salivary cortisol and blood pressure), overall health-related                  quality-of-life and injury-specific functional status, mental health status,         and total sickness/injury absence from work.  The influence of both directly         observed physical-ergonomic factors at work and psychosocial occupational            exposures on socioeconomic gradients in the risk of these conditions will be         assessed.  Finally they propose to examine, through qualitative research             methods, the social contextual factors within participating hospitals, which         influence working conditions.

"CENTER FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS RESEARCH The goal of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to advance knowledge about health related problems of vulnerable populations (e.g., ethnic people of color; women and children; adolescent mothers; the poor; homeless and elderly; substance users; and individuals exposed to hazardous conditions and polluted environments) and, thereby, decrease relative risks, increase resource availability, & improve the health status of these populations. National health priorities aimed at eliminating disparities in health status, reducing health risks, and promoting use of preventive interventions among specified population groups, as outlined in Health People 2010, will be a major focus of the CVPR. A great need exists for development of a CVPR in California (CA), and particularly in Los Angeles County (LAC). The large population, multicultural diversity, and high incidence of poverty make LAC an excellent site for investigating issues related to the health status of vulnerable populations and addressing their social policy implications. Aims of the CVPR include: 1) advancing knowledge about health-related problems of vulnerable populations by supporting ongoing research of investigators and new pilot-feasibility studies designed to improve health status outcomes of diverse vulnerable populations; 2) strengthening the research support and utilization of molecular/cellular/physiologic assays in studies of the risks and health status of vulnerable populations through the Bio-Laboratory Core; 3) enhancing research support and development of supportive community networks in all phases of research with vulnerable populations through the Social Policy and Dissemination Core; and 4) creating mechanisms for interdisciplinary preparation of scientists and collaboration of scientists and collaboration of scientists in biobehavioral research with vulnerable populations involving qualitative and quantitative methodology through activities of the Research Support Core and the Administrative Core.

"RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MEDICATION USE IN US NURSING HOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Abstract) Using individual level data on all               residents of all U.S. nursing homes in five states collected for the Health          Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Multistate Nursing Home Case-mix and            Quality Demonstration Project, we have noted in our prescribing trends studies       that minority residents are less likely to receive medically appropriate             treatments. We have also recently examined racial/ethnic disparities in U.S.         nursing home care, and have preliminary evidence to suggest that, in fact,           minority elders do not receive care of comparable quality to whites,                 controlling for differences in severity of conditions, socio-economic status         and patient preference. Although we have considered race/ethnicity as an             independent variable in analyses conducted for different purposes, we have yet       to systematically review disparities by race/ethnicity in the receipt of             medications. Identifying the extent to which individual factors may explain the      disturbing trends evaluated thus far is essential to our understanding.              Regardless we have very little understanding of how these racial/ethnic              disparities are influenced by organizational structures (specifically. facility      size, ownership, system-affiliation, and staffing patterns).                                                                                                              Using data collected from 1992-1997 including information on all                     Medicare/Medicaid recipients in 2,040 nursing homes in six states (New York,         Mississippi, South Dakota, Kansas, Ohio, and Maine), we will focus on newly          admitted residents at least 65 years of age with conditions for which                pharmacologic therapy is available. We will explore hypotheses regarding             mechanisms to explain observed disparities. In particular, we are concerned          that any racial/ethnic differences observed may not be fully explained by            racial/ethnic differences in severity of conditions, patient preference, or          social class. As suggested in the literature, provider care may be influenced        by subtle or blatant forms of racial discrimination. Thus, we have selected          conditions that are reflective of available treatments for which risk to             benefit considerations may be non-differential with respect to race/ethnicity        and also, that are unlikely to be differentially rejected by racial/ethnic           minorities because of personal preferences.

"MEASURING AND IMPROVING QUALITY: CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure commonly performed among          the elderly to prevent stroke.  Its annual incidence is rising rapidly,          up 61 percent nationally between 1991 and 1994. Past research has                suggested significant quality problems relating to this procedure,               including: the selection of inappropriate surgical candidates, high              rates of complications in community-based studies, an inverse                    relationship between provider volume and complications, and substantial          racial disparities in use rates.  Recent studies have produced much new          data on the efficacy of this operation but few new data on quality of            care.                                                                                                                                                             We propose to investigate quality of care in carotid endarterectomy in           a retrospective, multiple cohort, 2-phase study, measuring                       appropriateness, risk-adjusted complications (death, stroke, and                 myocardial infarction), and the relationship of specific surgical                processes of care to outcomes.  In the phase 1, we will study patients           treated in a group of 7 collaborating hospitals.  In phase 2, we will            conduct 2 parallel investigations.  We will study a large, stratified            random sample of about 8000 Medicare cases from across New York State,           a sample large enough to build robust models of risk-adjusted                    perioperative complications.  We will examine appropriateness, risk-             adjusted outcomes, and surgical processes of care. Attempting to                 characterize best surgical practices, we will assess the extent to which         specific surgical processes of care are associated with low rates of             risk-adjusted perioperative complications.  In addition, we will explore         the relationship of hospital and surgeon volume to risk-adjusted                 perioperative complications.  We will also assess the relationship               between race and appropriateness.                                                                                                                                 In the second part of phase 2, we will design, conduct, and evaluate a           series of quality improvement interventions at the 7 collaborating               hospitals.  With the active participation of the surgeons who perform            carotid endarterectomy at these institutions, we will examine the phase          1 data on appropriateness.  We will examine differences among                    collaborating hospitals in the surgical processes of care shown in Phase         2 to be associated with improved risk-adjusted perioperative outcomes.           We will determine at each hospital where opportunities exist to improve          both the appropriateness of patient selection and the effectiveness of           surgical processes of care, intervene to improve, and assess the impact          of those interventions.

"RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MEDICATION USE IN US NURSING HOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Abstract) Using individual level data on all               residents of all U.S. nursing homes in five states collected for the Health          Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Multistate Nursing Home Case-mix and            Quality Demonstration Project, we have noted in our prescribing trends studies       that minority residents are less likely to receive medically appropriate             treatments. We have also recently examined racial/ethnic disparities in U.S.         nursing home care, and have preliminary evidence to suggest that, in fact,           minority elders do not receive care of comparable quality to whites,                 controlling for differences in severity of conditions, socio-economic status         and patient preference. Although we have considered race/ethnicity as an             independent variable in analyses conducted for different purposes, we have yet       to systematically review disparities by race/ethnicity in the receipt of             medications. Identifying the extent to which individual factors may explain the      disturbing trends evaluated thus far is essential to our understanding.              Regardless we have very little understanding of how these racial/ethnic              disparities are influenced by organizational structures (specifically. facility      size, ownership, system-affiliation, and staffing patterns).                                                                                                              Using data collected from 1992-1997 including information on all                     Medicare/Medicaid recipients in 2,040 nursing homes in six states (New York,         Mississippi, South Dakota, Kansas, Ohio, and Maine), we will focus on newly          admitted residents at least 65 years of age with conditions for which                pharmacologic therapy is available. We will explore hypotheses regarding             mechanisms to explain observed disparities. In particular, we are concerned          that any racial/ethnic differences observed may not be fully explained by            racial/ethnic differences in severity of conditions, patient preference, or          social class. As suggested in the literature, provider care may be influenced        by subtle or blatant forms of racial discrimination.

"Racial Differences in the Treatment of Heart Disease Acute myocardial infarction and heart failure result are a common cause of morbidity and mortality for elderly patients in the United States. Numerous studies have documented that ethnic minority populations receive less intensive cardiac care than non-Hispanic whites in a variety of clinical settings. These studies have focused on major procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting using both large administrative and small clinically detailed databases. Whether these differences are increasing, or decreasing is unclear. The reasons for racial and gender differences are also unclear. Several studies have documented that age, severity of illness, and insurance status can explain part, but not all of the observed differences in treatment. Whether physician, hospital and regional characteristics affect treatment differences remains unknown. In addition, little is known about differences between racial groups in less invasive interventions such as medication use or smoking cessation counseling. The degree to which these treatment differences explain differences in survival is also not known. The aim of this proposal is to further examine racial differences in treatment of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure among elderly patients in the United States. Using multiple national datasets from the Health Care Financing Administration (Medicare) already available to the investigators, we will examine trends in racial differences in treatment and outcome for elderly patients from 1985 through 1997. Detailed clinical data from Medicare and the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction will be used to examine racial differences in the appropriateness of care for acute myocardial infarction (aspirin, beta-blockers, reperfusion, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, smoking cessation counseling and angiography) and heart failure (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, measures of left ventricular function). Several potential causes of treatment differences will be examined by linking patient data to procedure refusal (Cooperative Cardiovascular Project) physician (American Medical Association Physician Master File), hospital (American Hospital Association data) and regional data (Census bureau statistics at the level of zip code). Examining the physician, hospital and regional variation in treatment differences are necessary if systematic strategies are to be implemented to reduce gender and racial disparities in the treatment of elderly patients.

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Intensity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1996, average Medicare per capita expenditures were $3,700 in Minneapolis and $7,783 in Miami. Differences of a similar magnitude were observed across regions in patterns of end-of-life care, such as the chances of dying in a hospital or the number of different specialists seen in the last 6 months of life. Previous research indicates that these geographic variations in treatment are due largely to differences in intensity, i.e., differences in the way similar patients are treated. Improved understanding of the causes and consequences of regional variations in intensity could have important implications for the health and well-being of the elderly, for addressing health disparities and for the financial health of the Medicare trust funds. This project addresses these issues by: 1. Measuring how patients of similar illness levels are treated differently across regions with respect to both overall intensity and different dimensions of intensity. 2. Determining the causes of differences in intensity. To what extent are they due to patient preferences for care, physician beliefs, or other factors? Why is it the norm in some regions but not others for elderly patients to experience extensive diagnostic testing for CAD, with subsequent downstream procedures, specialist referrals, and hospitalization? 3. Studying the consequences of greater health care intensity. What is the impact of greater intensity of care on outcomes that include survival, health functioning, and well-being more generally? 4. Seeking to understand how health care intensity, either across regions or over time, affects disparities across socioeconomic groups in health care treatments and outcomes. The project will bring together a cross-disciplinary research team comprised of investigators from the DAWG; the PORT; the Maine Medical Center; the Center for Survey Research in Boston, MA; Massachusetts General Hospital; and the National Bureau of Economic Research.

"OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH GRADIENTS IN HOSPITAL WORKERS:  THE   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                 Socioeconomic gradients in health status are ubiquitous in space, persistent         in time, and pervasive across diverse health outcomes.  Yet little is known of       how they arise, and specifically, how great a contribution is made to them by        working conditions during adult life.  Existing occupational cohort studies,         such as the landmark Whitehall publications, have failed to convince some            observers that work-related ""psychosocial"" exposures, e.g., the degree of            control felt by employees over their jobs, constitute the key causal                 influences responsible for socioeconomic gradients in the health of the              general adult population, especially gradients in chronic disease.  Largely          missing in the debate thus far is high-quality evidence on gradients from            workplaces with a wide range of jobs -- Whitehall, for example, is                   fundamentally an office worker study.  The present proposal is premised on the       view that rich insights into the genesis of such health ""gradients"" may be           gained by studying in detail, over some years, a workplace, such as a                hospital, that has a very wide range of jobs, and of employees from different        social classes.                                                                                                                                                           By far the major ""short-term"" occupational health problem of this workforce,         and many others, is work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) -- a broad       class of outcomes including low back pain and upper extremity injuries, such         as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.  Both psychosocial and                     physical-ergonomic exposures at work are now thought to be joint determinants        of these musculoskeletal problems.  Thus, psychosocial aspects of work are           increasingly recognized as risk factors for both sorts of illness processes:         traumatic and chronic disease.  Yet there appears to be a dearth of research         linking socioeconomic and job-category disparities in the risk of WRMSDs, with       well-known gradients in many longer-term health outcomes, particularly               coronary heart disease and its risk factors (such as hypertension).  The             investigators propose a study to shed light on the nature and multi-factorial        etiology of hospital gradients, across job categories and employee social            class backgrounds, in the occurrence of several potentially work-related             health outcomes in hospitals.  The outcomes studied will be lost-time,               work-related musculoskeletal disorders, non-invasive measures of allostatic          load (salivary cortisol and blood pressure), overall health-related                  quality-of-life and injury-specific functional status, mental health status,         and total sickness/injury absence from work.  The influence of both directly         observed physical-ergonomic factors at work and psychosocial occupational            exposures on socioeconomic gradients in the risk of these conditions will be         assessed.  Finally they propose to examine, through qualitative research             methods, the social contextual factors within participating hospitals, which         influence working conditions.  The study team will also work with a                  labor-management team to develop possible interventions for the problems that        are identified by this study.

"Center on Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Center on Health Disparities Research (CHDR) is to enhance our understanding of health disparities by creating an infrastructure that supports health disparity research (HDR) across the life span. The CHDR will support a partnership between researchers, faculty and students at a majority institution, Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, and a minority serving institution, North Carolina Agriculture &Technology State University School of Nursing. The Center will expand the cadre of nurse researchers involved in minority health and health disparities research. It will also increase the number of research projects aimed at eliminating health disparities (HD), and enhance the career development of potential minority nurse investigators. The three cores, administrative, pilot feasibility, and research mentoring, form the building blocks of our CHDR to achieve the following objectives: To facilitate HDR across the lifespan by managing overall activities and shared resources of the Center and by assisting in the development and coordination of efforts between the majority institution and the partnering institution (Administrative Core); 2. To extend our understanding of HD across the life span by developing and testing culturally sensitive nursing interventions related to disparities in access to health care, processes of care, and health outcomes in selected areas of HDR related to faculty expertise: health promotion, symptom management, domestic violence. (Pilot/Feasibility Research Core); 3. To promote development of research skills, opportunities for scholarship, and attainment of external funding related to HDR among faculty, staff, predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, and visiting scholars. (Research Mentoring Core).   Three disparity areas- accesses to care, processes of care, and health outcomes- will serve as an overarching framework with a focus on culturally sensitive HD nursing interventions. The Executive Committee, including Center Director and Co-Director, core directors and Center investigators from both the majority and partnering institution will assist the Director in making scientific and administrative decisions related to the Center.

"CENTER FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS RESEARCH The goal of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to advance knowledge about health related problems of vulnerable populations (e.g., ethnic people of color; women and children; adolescent mothers; the poor; homeless and elderly; substance users; and individuals exposed to hazardous conditions and polluted environments) and, thereby, decrease relative risks, increase resource availability, & improve the health status of these populations. National health priorities aimed at eliminating disparities in health status, reducing health risks, and promoting use of preventive interventions among specified population groups, as outlined in Health People 2010, will be a major focus of the CVPR. A great need exists for development of a CVPR in California (CA), and particularly in Los Angeles County (LAC). The large population, multicultural diversity, and high incidence of poverty make LAC an excellent site for investigating issues related to the health status of vulnerable populations and addressing their social policy implications. Aims of the CVPR include: 1) advancing knowledge about health-related problems of vulnerable populations by supporting ongoing research of investigators and new pilot-feasibility studies designed to improve health status outcomes of diverse vulnerable populations; 2) strengthening the research support and utilization of molecular/cellular/physiologic assays in studies of the risks and health status of vulnerable populations through the Bio-Laboratory Core; 3) enhancing research support and development of supportive community networks in all phases of research with vulnerable populations through the Social Policy and Dissemination Core; and 4) creating mechanisms for interdisciplinary preparation of scientists and collaboration of scientists and collaboration of scientists in biobehavioral research with vulnerable populations involving qualitative and quantitative methodology through activities of the Research Support Core and the Administrative Core. By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of vulnerable research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of vulnerable populations research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center faculty will be able to address important nursing and other practice issues and deliver research results into the community. The design of the CVPR creates a unique scientific interface between biologic and behavioral researchers studying vulnerable populations and facilitates translation of research into community-based programs with implications for social policy. The CVPR will include 12 key faculty members and 12 affiliate members from nursing and other disciplines. A Scientific-Community Advisory Committee composed of renowned scientists and leaders in the community will further strengthen the Center's capabilities. UCLA School of Nursing has had a long-term commitment to improving health status outcomes of vulnerable populations through its research, clinical facilities, and educational programs.

"The Impact of HMO's on Disparties  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health care represent key contributors to racial/ethnic disparities in health.  Although racial and ethnic disparities have been extensively documented across the continuum of health care, relatively little is known about the impact of HMOs on these disparities.  On one hand, improved accountability for population-wide health care quality and strategies designed to constrain over-utilization may help HMOs to reduce disparities.  On the other hand, more stringent cost containment efforts by HMOs may impose barriers to care for vulnerable populations.  Under current HEDIS reporting requirements such disparities go undetected.   The primary aim of this three-year project is to assess the scope and magnitude of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in HMOs.  We will aggregate several years using the following national surveys:  The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey, and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.  We will develop age, sex, and casemix adjusted utilization and quality measures that examine racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in preventive care, satisfaction, change in health status, use of expensive hospital-based procedures, and avoidable hospital Complications and mortality.  We will compare disparities in these measures between HMO and non-HMO members and assess changes overtime.   Findings from this project should inform AHRQ's National Disparities Reporting.  Because the measures will be derived from periodic national surveys, progress towards the elimination of disparities can be tracked over time using future iterations of these surveys and measures.  If the study hypotheses are confirmed, the findings will underscore the need for HMOs to track and address disparities among their members if the Healthy People 2010 for the elimination of disparities is to be achieved.

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Intensity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic status and race are clearly associated with large differences in treatments and outcomes for many health problems, and there is evidence that such disparities are increasing over time.  But relatively little is known about the causes of such variations.  Are they the consequence of patient preferences or physician behavior?  Nor is the role of geography in disparities well understood: do African-Americans, for example, receive less care because they happen to live in regions with lower overall utilization rates?  This resubmission of Project 4 will provide new evidence on these issues by examining the relationships among variations in provider, area, and policy factors, treatments and health outcomes.  We will    Examine the relationship of physician, hospital and regional characteristics to differences in treatments and outcomes.  Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions will be used to estimate how treatment patterns, as well as outcome differences, are associated with race and income.   Estimate to what extent differences in treatments reflect the patient preferences.  Using the proposed Survey of Patient Preferences (Core C Supplement), preferences for scale, scope, and surveillance intensity will be compared by age, sex and race of respondent.   Measure factors that explain Black-White and income differences in access to high quality health care.  Using the Medicare claims data and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, we will address whether African-American or low income elderly patients are admitted to lower quality hospitals and, if so, why.    Consider the role of technological innovation on the rising disparities in health outcomes following hospital admissions for heart attacks (AMI).  Variations in the diffusion of surgical innovations across race and region will be used to estimate the role of technology in the rising inequality in health outcomes.  Determine the effects of policy changes on treatment and health disparities in the elderly population by focusing on two important areas where there have been significant changes: (a) Medicaid eligibility and (b) the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program, both of which increased reimbursements to hospitals serving large disadvantaged populations.

"Re-Exploring Racial Disparities in Hospital Care DESCRIPTION: Eliminating racial disparities in health care is a national priority. Although many studies have examined racial differences in aspects of hospital care such as severity of illness, care-seeking patterns, use of clinical procedures, use of resources, and outcome, no published research has integrated and examined these aspects simultaneously. Moreover, while many studies have reported racial disparities in hospital care only a few of them have examined the interactive effects between race and other factors on hospital care. Finally, while most of race-related studies on hospital care have focused on comparisons between one minority and non-Hispanic Caucasians, very few studies have examined health outcomes among the three largest racial groups (non-Hispanic Caucasians, African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans) simultaneously, let alone other ethnic groups.  The proposed study forms an integrated conceptual framework, based on the concept of episode of care, the behavioral framework of health care use, and the structure-process-outcome triad, to examine the relationships between race and hospital care, in a systemic and comprehensive manner. The episode of hospital care, from the patient?s perspective, can be described by five dimensions: severity of illness, care-seeking patterns, process or receiving treatment, economic outcome, and clinical outcome. The study, with the inclusion of patients from all ethnic groups, focuses on four major diseases (heart attack, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and stroke), extracts data from the 1995, 1997, 1999 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) datasets collected by the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), adopts validated administrative data based, risk adjustment methods, conducts multivariate analysis to control for potential confounding factors. This allows systemic exploration of the relationships between race and the five episode of hospital care -dimensions and, in particular, to examines the interactive effects between race and other factors on outcome that are measured by the in-hospital mortality risk.    Findings from this research will furnish information to help public and private sectors decision-makers better understand the racial gaps in hospital care in a more systemic way. It will also elucidate key factors that result in gaps in service to vulnerable populations. This will aid public policy development of effective interventions to improve health care delivery-with regard to eliminating racial disparities.

"MEASURING AND IMPROVING QUALITY: CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure commonly performed among          the elderly to prevent stroke.  Its annual incidence is rising rapidly,          up 61 percent nationally between 1991 and 1994. Past research has                suggested significant quality problems relating to this procedure,               including: the selection of inappropriate surgical candidates, high              rates of complications in community-based studies, an inverse                    relationship between provider volume and complications, and substantial          racial disparities in use rates.  Recent studies have produced much new          data on the efficacy of this operation but few new data on quality of            care.                                                                                                                                                             We propose to investigate quality of care in carotid endarterectomy in           a retrospective, multiple cohort, 2-phase study, measuring                       appropriateness, risk-adjusted complications (death, stroke, and                 myocardial infarction), and the relationship of specific surgical                processes of care to outcomes.  In the phase 1, we will study patients           treated in a group of 7 collaborating hospitals.  In phase 2, we will            conduct 2 parallel investigations.  We will study a large, stratified            random sample of about 8000 Medicare cases from across New York State,           a sample large enough to build robust models of risk-adjusted                    perioperative complications.  We will examine appropriateness, risk-             adjusted outcomes, and surgical processes of care. Attempting to                 characterize best surgical practices, we will assess the extent to which         specific surgical processes of care are associated with low rates of             risk-adjusted perioperative complications.  In addition, we will explore         the relationship of hospital and surgeon volume to risk-adjusted                 perioperative complications.  We will also assess the relationship               between race and appropriateness.                                                                                                                                 In the second part of phase 2, we will design, conduct, and evaluate a           series of quality improvement interventions at the 7 collaborating               hospitals.  With the active participation of the surgeons who perform            carotid endarterectomy at these institutions, we will examine the phase          1 data on appropriateness.  We will examine differences among                    collaborating hospitals in the surgical processes of care shown in Phase         2 to be associated with improved risk-adjusted perioperative outcomes.           We will determine at each hospital where opportunities exist to improve          both the appropriateness of patient selection and the effectiveness of           surgical processes of care, intervene to improve, and assess the impact          of those interventions.

"Nursing and Prescriptive Authority: 1900 to the present  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal requests funding to conduct a three year historical investigation on nurses and prescriptive authority in the United States, 1900 to the present. Given (1) the disparity in the accessibility and availability of health care services in both rural and urban settings and (2) changes in the settings in which nurse practitioners (NPs) practice (now including acute and specialty care), it is time to rethink professional roles and responsibilities. In fact, it is imperative that we consider the possibility of expanding prescriptive authority for advanced practice nurses (APNs) in order to use health care personnel effectively. Today, there is considerable controversy among the professions of medicine, nursing and pharmacy and in the state legislatures concerning the issue of granting and/or expanding prescriptive authority for APNs. Nurses must address this issue for the public and the profession, and in some cases, provide testimony to state legislatures. To do so, they need the perspective of nursing history. The history of how nurses have managed patient care by dispensing and furnishing drugs, as well as the outcomes of how nurses have fared with the limited prescriptive authority, must be studied to determine if increasing their prescriptive privileges is indeed a viable solution to improving accessibility to health care while controlling costs. Unless this history is understood, proposed solutions may repeat the problems of the past or complicate matters further. Little is written on this history. In fact, the history is embedded in am assortment of legal cases and other primary documents in archives across the nation. These historical data have not been synthesized and described, nor have they been analyzed in historical context. A social history framework will be used to conduct this research.    Primary sources, chosen as representative case studies, will include legal cases, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists papers, the Frontier Nursing Service collection, archival materials from The Center for Nursing Historical Inquiry at the University of Virginia (UVA), the Lillian Wald Collection at Columbia University, and materials from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). The findings will be analyzed within the history of health care in a changing socio-political, medical, economic, and legal environment. UVA, with its Center for Nursing Historical Inquiry is well positioned to support this project. Recommendations for future legislation will be made.

"Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Managemen    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is submitted in response to RFA NR -02 0004, Nursing Partnership Centers on Health Disparities Grants. Yale School of Nursing (YSN) and the Howard University Division of Nursing (HUDON) propose to develop a Partnership Center on Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Management. Self-management encompasses a broad range of health, lifestyle, behavioral and self-assessment and treatment activities practiced by an individual in the context of the family, often with the support of nurses. Self and family management activities vary across socioeconomic status, gender and ethnic/cultural background. Within certain groups, disparities exist in risk to health status, access to health care and in treatment outcomes. We believe that self-management represents one promising avenue for eliminating these disparities. With better understanding of self-management approaches in populations experiencing health disparities, nursing interventions can be developed to support self-management and eliminate health disparities. The Center builds on an existing partnership between YSN and HUDON: the federally funded Yale-Howard Scholars Program. The scientific focus of the Partnership Center extends the work of YSN's funded Exploratory Center on Self-Management Interventions for Populations at Risk into the area of disparities. The Partnership Center will build capacity by recruiting and developing nurse scientists to conduct culturally relevant and competent research to eliminate health disparities. The Center will be under the direction of Drs. Catherine Gilliss (YSN) & Dorothy Powell (HUDON), and will include: Administrative Core (Gilliss/Powell; Drs. Grey [YSN] & Nichols [HUDON]); Pilot/Feasibility Core (Drs. Williams YSN] & Austin [Howard University]; Research Mentoring Core (Drs.

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Intensity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1996, average Medicare per capita expenditures were $3,700 in Minneapolis and $7,783 in Miami. Differences of a similar magnitude were observed across regions in patterns of end-of-life care, such as the chances of dying in a hospital or the number of different specialists seen in the last 6 months of life. Previous research indicates that these geographic variations in treatment are due largely to differences in intensity, i.e., differences in the way similar patients are treated. Improved understanding of the causes and consequences of regional variations in intensity could have important implications for the health and well-being of the elderly, for addressing health disparities and for the financial health of the Medicare trust funds. This project addresses these issues by: 1. Measuring how patients of similar illness levels are treated differently across regions with respect to both overall intensity and different dimensions of intensity. 2. Determining the causes of differences in intensity. To what extent are they due to patient preferences for care, physician beliefs, or other factors? Why is it the norm in some regions but not others for elderly patients to experience extensive diagnostic testing for CAD, with subsequent downstream procedures, specialist referrals, and hospitalization? 3. Studying the consequences of greater health care intensity. What is the impact of greater intensity of care on outcomes that include survival, health functioning, and well-being more generally? 4. Seeking to understand how health care intensity, either across regions or over time, affects disparities across socioeconomic groups in health care treatments and outcomes. The project will bring together a cross-disciplinary research team comprised of investigators from the DAWG; the PORT; the Maine Medical Center; the Center for Survey Research in Boston, MA; Massachusetts General Hospital; and the National Bureau of Economic Research.

"The Midwest Nursing Center Consortium Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Midwest Nursing Center Consortium Research Network (MNCCRN) is requesting funds for category I to build an infrastructure for a practice-based research network (PBRN).  The MNCCRN comprises 20 community nursing centers (CNCs) that have been in operation from 3 to 17 years, representing 13 midwestern universities with a total of 84 practitioners.  The majority of CNCs provide primary care services to underserved populations.  Collectively, these centers serve the health and illness needs of a diverse population of vulnerable urban and rural residents who are at risk for limited access to care and poor health outcomes.  CNCs provide alternative models of health care delivery that integrate primary care, public health, and social services.  Services provided at the CNCs include health promotion, disease prevention, health teaching, counseling services, intensive case management, as well as population-based programming in partnership with community residents and other area human service providers.  In many instances, the services provided by these CNCs are the only ones readily accessible to area residents.  Aims and objectives of this application center around the establishment of: a) a regional PBRN of advanced practice nurse providers who practice in nontraditional CNC settings; this PBRN will link with other similar regional nursing PBRNs and grow to a national network over time; b) a web-based system for data collection and transfer that will comply with evolving data privacy mandates; and c) a collaborative program of participatory community-focused research with vulnerable populations that will inform primary care practice, health professional education, and health care policy. These aims will be accomplished through the development of an organizational structure that addresses research policies and procedures for member centers, establishes an electronic communication network, and outlines a fiscal plan to ensure long-term viability.  The priority of this project is to establish an infrastructure for a PBRN that will ultimately conduct research. Both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies will be used to measure process, structure, and outcomes of this endeavor.  The documentation of primary health care practice and outcomes in CNCs through the support of practice-based research networks, such as the MNCCRN, will provide critical data to reduce the health disparities currently experienced in vulnerable populations in the United States.

"OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH GRADIENTS IN HOSPITAL WORKERS:  THE   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                 Socioeconomic gradients in health status are ubiquitous in space, persistent         in time, and pervasive across diverse health outcomes.  Yet little is known of       how they arise, and specifically, how great a contribution is made to them by        working conditions during adult life.  Existing occupational cohort studies,         such as the landmark Whitehall publications, have failed to convince some            observers that work-related ""psychosocial"" exposures, e.g., the degree of            control felt by employees over their jobs, constitute the key causal                 influences responsible for socioeconomic gradients in the health of the              general adult population, especially gradients in chronic disease.  Largely          missing in the debate thus far is high-quality evidence on gradients from            workplaces with a wide range of jobs -- Whitehall, for example, is                   fundamentally an office worker study.  The present proposal is premised on the       view that rich insights into the genesis of such health ""gradients"" may be           gained by studying in detail, over some years, a workplace, such as a                hospital, that has a very wide range of jobs, and of employees from different        social classes.                                                                                                                                                           By far the major ""short-term"" occupational health problem of this workforce,         and many others, is work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) -- a broad       class of outcomes including low back pain and upper extremity injuries, such         as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.  Both psychosocial and                     physical-ergonomic exposures at work are now thought to be joint determinants        of these musculoskeletal problems.  Thus, psychosocial aspects of work are           increasingly recognized as risk factors for both sorts of illness processes:         traumatic and chronic disease.  Yet there appears to be a dearth of research         linking socioeconomic and job-category disparities in the risk of WRMSDs, with       well-known gradients in many longer-term health outcomes, particularly               coronary heart disease and its risk factors (such as hypertension).  The             investigators propose a study to shed light on the nature and multi-factorial        etiology of hospital gradients, across job categories and employee social            class backgrounds, in the occurrence of several potentially work-related             health outcomes in hospitals.  The outcomes studied will be lost-time,               work-related musculoskeletal disorders, non-invasive measures of allostatic          load (salivary cortisol and blood pressure), overall health-related                  quality-of-life and injury-specific functional status, mental health status,         and total sickness/injury absence from work.  The influence of both directly         observed physical-ergonomic factors at work and psychosocial occupational            exposures on socioeconomic gradients in the risk of these conditions will be         assessed.  Finally they propose to examine, through qualitative research             methods, the social contextual factors within participating hospitals, which         influence working conditions.  The study team will also work with a                  labor-management team to develop possible interventions for the problems that        are identified by this study.

"Racial Disparity in Access High Quality Cardiac Surgeons DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities in access to high quality cardiac surgeons among the elderly Racial disparities in access to health care services is a well documented, if poorly understood, persistent characteristic of the American health care system. Inadequate access to services by racial minorities, as it leads to poor health outcomes and poor health, has become an important part of our national health policy agenda. Racial minorities have been shown to be less likely to receive cardiac surgery. Even when they gain access to surgery, they are still disadvantaged because they access surgeons with higher risk-adjusted mortality rates (RAMR), compared to whites.      These issues are of particular importance to the elderly population, as heart disease is one of the major morbidities in this population, it is the leading cause of death and over 50% of CABG surgeries are performed on individuals aged 65 and older. The proposed study is designed to test specific hypotheses about the factors contributing to the observed disparities in access to high quality cardiac surgeons. It will test hypotheses related to three referral decisions foci: the patient, the referring physician and the managed care organization (MCO). The population studied will include all Medicare patients undergoing CABG surgery, all cardiac surgeons and hospitals in NYS. Medicare CABG patients will be surveyed about their use of RAMR information and their encounter with the referring physician. Medicare claims for medical care encounters prior to the surgery will be used to analyze referral patterns. NYS SPARCS data and MCO information, as well as a unique data set with information about contracting patterns of MCOs with hospitals and cardiac surgeons, will be used to study the effect of MCOs on racial disparities in access. Statistical multivariate regression techniques will be used to analyze the data. The knowledge gained in this project is essential for development of targeted programs that could successfully address the disparity in access to high quality cardiac care among elderly racial minorities.

"The Impact of HMO's on Disparties  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health care represent key contributors to racial/ethnic disparities in health.  Although racial and ethnic disparities have been extensively documented across the continuum of health care, relatively little is known about the impact of HMOs on these disparities.  On one hand, improved accountability for population-wide health care quality and strategies designed to constrain over-utilization may help HMOs to reduce disparities.  On the other hand, more stringent cost containment efforts by HMOs may impose barriers to care for vulnerable populations.  Under current HEDIS reporting requirements such disparities go undetected.   The primary aim of this three-year project is to assess the scope and magnitude of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in HMOs.  We will aggregate several years using the following national surveys:  The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey, and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.  We will develop age, sex, and casemix adjusted utilization and quality measures that examine racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in preventive care, satisfaction, change in health status, use of expensive hospital-based procedures, and avoidable hospital Complications and mortality.  We will compare disparities in these measures between HMO and non-HMO members and assess changes overtime.   Findings from this project should inform AHRQ's National Disparities Reporting.  Because the measures will be derived from periodic national surveys, progress towards the elimination of disparities can be tracked over time using future iterations of these surveys and measures.  If the study hypotheses are confirmed, the findings will underscore the need for HMOs to track and address disparities among their members if the Healthy People 2010 for the elimination of disparities is to be achieved.

"Southwest Center: Partners in Health Disparity Resaearch    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the prevalence of health disparities resulting from geographic location, income, and race/ethnicity; the lack of research on health promotion in racial and ethnic minorities; and the paucity of nurses and nurse scientists among racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., it is critical to focus efforts on expanding the preparation of nurses and nurse scientists from minority populations and on expanding research aimed at improving health and health care. The proposed Southwest Partnership Center for Nursing Research on Health Disparities (SWPC) will focus on health disparities in rural, low-income, Mexican-American, and/or American-Indian populations. Specific aims are 1) Establish the Southwest Partnership Center for Nursing Research on Health Disparities within the formal structure of the School of Nursing at The University of Texas at Austin and the formal structure of the Department of Nursing in the minority-serving institution of New Mexico State University; 2) Build capacity for nursing research on health disparities experienced by populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian by increasing the number of nurse researchers in the two partnering institutions conducting studies within a health promotion framework; 3) Increase the number and quality of studies by nursing faculty and undergraduate and graduate students in the partnering institutions that focus on reducing or eliminating health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian within a health promotion framework; 4) Enhance the research career development of minority nurse investigators, including undergraduate and graduate nursing students and faculty at both partnering institutions, with particular emphasis on addressing minority health and health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian using a health promotion framework; and 5) increase the number of research projects proposed by nursing faculty and students in the partnering institutions that involve interdisciplinary collaboration and that focus on reducing health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian within a health promotion framework.         ",Southwest Center: Partners in Health Disparity Resaearch,6663846,P20NR008352,"['cooperative study ', ' health science research potential ', ' nursing research ', ' Native American ', ' Mexican American ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NINR,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,P20,2003,149217,0.052666347360359266

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities and High Volume Hospitals    DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):  The elimination of the existing pattern of large and widespread racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care is an official goal of American health policy, but the causes of these disparities are only partly understood.  This project examines a potentially important source of disparities that has received little attention--racial and ethnic differences in the source of medical care.  Focusing on residents of New York City and surrounding counties in New York and New Jersey, the study will use the HCUP state inpatient data base to compare hospital usage of whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans.  The primary focus will be on comparing use of high volume hospitals for conditions and procedures for which previous research has demonstrated a positive relationship between volume and outcomes.  Our preliminary analyses of the use of New York City hospitals by residents of New York City found that whites were about twice as likely as African-Americans to use a high volume hospital for carotid endarterectomy (64% vs. 32%) and for cancer surgery (42% vs. 23%), with rates for the other two ethnic groups falling in between.      The project is designed to explore the magnitude of racial/ethnic disparities in the use of high volume hospitals for the 22 conditions and procedures for which a positive volume-outcome relationship has been found, to identify factors that help account for these disparities, and to explore some dimensions of potential policy significance.  Using measures of individual patients or of their neighborhood (based on patient's zip code), the analyses will explore the role of age, gender, type of insurance, and proximity to the hospital, including how patterns within New York City compare to those of its suburbs.  Inclusion in the analysis of two comparison procedures with no known volume-outcome relationship will permit us to assess whether racial/ethnic disparities in the use of high-high volume hospitals is related to the existence of evidence that volume is associated with better outcomes.  Separate analyses will examine the relationship of race/ethnicity and use of high volume hospitals within the Medicaid and Medicare populations.  We will also give special attention to whether disparities are lower when cases have become concentrated in fewer hospitals as a result of public policies--certificate-of-need, which has concentrated cardiac surgery, and a quality-enhancing program that has attracted large numbers of patients to ""designated care centers"" for AIDS.      The study has both substantive and methodologic aims.  Substantively, it opens inquiry into processes that may lead to differential distribution of racial/ethnic groups that are likely to have different quality outcomes.  This type of sorting may be an important and largely unrecognized source of health disparities in the U.S.  Methodologically, we will explore a number of measurement issues, including the effects of alternative ways of operationalizing high volume and proximity.

"Race, Ethnicity and Quality of Health Care for Newborns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous studies have examined factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes for newborns.  An issue that has not been well studied is variation in the use of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and variation in the use of high quality hospitals.  Studies in other areas (e.g. cardiac care) document large racial and ethnic disparities in treatment use and use of high quality providers, raising questions about the role that this might play in newborn outcome disparities as well.  We will study racial and ethnic variation in use of NICUs, particularly the use of advanced and high volume NICUs, and use of high quality hospitals by newborns, particularly LBW and VLBW newborns, using secondary datasets that link vital statistics and hospital discharge data for all births in 7 states over most of the 1990s.  Our analysis of high quality hospital use will be based on new measures of hospital quality based on patient outcomes that we will develop using new and innovative methods.  Our main analysis is designed to achieve 3 specific aims: 1) to investigate the extent of differences in use of NICUs and high volume facilities by race and ethnicity, and examine the correlates of differences in utilization rates; 2) to construct new outcome-based indicators of the quality of hospital care for newborns, and examine variations in the quality of hospitals at which newborns of different races and ethnicities are born or to which they are transferred, and to examine the correlates of differences; and 3) to examine the effect of differences in access to NICUs, high volume facilities, and high quality hospitals on disparities in health outcomes for newborns by race and ethnicity. The datasets we will use also afford more extensive opportunities to control for co-morbidities and other risk factors than have been available in previous large-scale analyses of newborn outcome disparities, as well as presenting the opportunity to study the role played by geographic (""small area"") variations in newborn outcome disparities.  As we conduct our analysis of disparities in NICU and high quality hospital use, we will also apply these capabilities of the new datasets to the study of disparities, working to achieve specific aim 4: to use the new linked databases to extend work on racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes for newborns, particularly accounting for variations in co-morbidities and other risk factors, newly available in the new linked datasets, and studying effects of variation across geographic areas.

"Overcoming Barriers to Early Phase Clinical Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   This application addresses the low accrual rates of minorities to early (Phase I - Phase II) cancer clinical trials. We have identified low referral rates of minority patients to the hospitals comprising the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, a consortium of the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Massachusetts General Hospital, as a major barrier to recruitment of minority patients to early phase trials. Historically, eight percent of our 15,000 new patients each year come from minority communities, and 6-8% of patients entering our early clinical trials are minorities. To address the problem of low referral rates, we propose to establish a system for expediting referral of patients from community medical oncology practice at the Cambridge Hospital. Dr. Lisa Weissmann, a member of the Harvard Medical School faculty, is the primary provider of care for 400 new cases of cancer each year, as referred from the Cambridge Health Alliance, a network of 15 community health centers in Cambridge. Her practice serves a largely (70 percent) minority population, fewer than 5 of whom are referred to academic health centers for clinical trials, Dr. Weissmann will partner with the Experimental Therapeutics Program of the DF/HCC to establish a simplified, navigator based referral system to the DF/HCC, with the object of referring 40 patients per year to our hospitals for early drug trials. The system will contain the following elements: (1) a practice based navigator at Cambridge Hospital, who will be responsible for making direct contacts with the an Early Trials Office at the DF/HCC, (2) a fund to provide travel and day care for patients coming to the DF/HCC from Cambridge Hospital, (3) an on-line protocol information system (Oncpro) to be extended to Dr. Weissmann's office, providing up to the date information on protocols open and eligibility requirements, (4) culturally relevant literature and information in Spanish, Portuguese, and Creole/French, available in Cambridge and at DF/HCC, (5) an extensive program to ensure coordination of efforts between Cambridge and the DF/HCC staffs, and training in cultural sensitivity for DFIHCC staff, and (6) an evaluation of accrual, disposition of referrals, and patient satisfaction, with refinement of existing satisfaction surveys.

Dissemination of research and community outreach are critically important to our center, therefore these activities will occur in the pilot core and mentorship core as outlined later in this proposal.         ",Hampton Penn Center To Reduce Health Disparities,6663750,P20NR008361,"['cooperative study ', ' health science research potential ', ' nursing research ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P20,2003,245786,0.042646007718492314
"Center on Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Center on Health Disparities Research (CHDR) is to enhance our understanding of health disparities by creating an infrastructure that supports health disparity research (HDR) across the life span. The CHDR will support a partnership between researchers, faculty and students at a majority institution, Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, and a minority serving institution, North Carolina Agriculture &Technology State University School of Nursing. The Center will expand the cadre of nurse researchers involved in minority health and health disparities research. It will also increase the number of research projects aimed at eliminating health disparities (HD), and enhance the career development of potential minority nurse investigators. The three cores, administrative, pilot feasibility, and research mentoring, form the building blocks of our CHDR to achieve the following objectives:   1. To facilitate HDR across the lifespan by managing overall activities and shared resources of the Center and by assisting in the development and coordination of efforts between the majority institution and the partnering institution (Administrative Core);   2. To extend our understanding of HD across the life span by developing and testing culturally sensitive nursing interventions related to disparities in access to health care, processes of care, and health outcomes in selected areas of HDR related to faculty expertise: health promotion, symptom management, domestic violence. (Pilot/Feasibility Research Core);   3. To promote development of research skills, opportunities for scholarship, and attainment of external funding related to HDR among faculty, staff, predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, and visiting scholars. (Research Mentoring Core).    Three disparity areas- accesses to care, processes of care, and health outcomes- will serve as an overarching framework with a focus on culturally sensitive HD nursing interventions. The Executive Committee, including Center Director and Co-Director, core directors and Center investigators from both the majority and partnering institution will assist the Director in making scientific and administrative decisions related to the Center. The Scientific Advisory Committee, composed of outstanding scientists, administrators, and community leaders will advise the Executive Committee and investigators in matters related to priorities for study, relevant issues, and problems within the designated research areas.

"Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is submitted in response to RFA NR -02 0004, Nursing Partnership Centers on Health Disparities Grants. Yale School of Nursing (YSN) and the Howard University Division of Nursing (HUDON) propose to develop a Partnership Center on Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Management. Self-management encompasses a broad range of health, lifestyle, behavioral and self-assessment and treatment activities practiced by an individual in the context of the family, often with the support of nurses. Self and family management activities vary across socioeconomic status, gender and ethnic/cultural background. Within certain groups, disparities exist in risk to health status, access to health care and in treatment outcomes. We believe that self-management represents one promising avenue for eliminating these disparities. With better understanding of self-management approaches in populations experiencing health disparities, nursing interventions can be developed to support self-management and eliminate health disparities.

"The Midwest Nursing Center Consortium Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Midwest Nursing Center Consortium Research Network (MNCCRN) is requesting funds for category I to build an infrastructure for a practice-based research network (PBRN).  The MNCCRN comprises 20 community nursing centers (CNCs) that have been in operation from 3 to 17 years, representing 13 midwestern universities with a total of 84 practitioners.  The majority of CNCs provide primary care services to underserved populations.  Collectively, these centers serve the health and illness needs of a diverse population of vulnerable urban and rural residents who are at risk for limited access to care and poor health outcomes.  CNCs provide alternative models of health care delivery that integrate primary care, public health, and social services.  Services provided at the CNCs include health promotion, disease prevention, health teaching, counseling services, intensive case management, as well as population-based programming in partnership with community residents and other area human service providers.  In many instances, the services provided by these CNCs are the only ones readily accessible to area residents.  Aims and objectives of this application center around the establishment of: a) a regional PBRN of advanced practice nurse providers who practice in nontraditional CNC settings; this PBRN will link with other similar regional nursing PBRNs and grow to a national network over time; b) a web-based system for data collection and transfer that will comply with evolving data privacy mandates; and c) a collaborative program of participatory community-focused research with vulnerable populations that will inform primary care practice, health professional education, and health care policy. These aims will be accomplished through the development of an organizational structure that addresses research policies and procedures for member centers, establishes an electronic communication network, and outlines a fiscal plan to ensure long-term viability.  The priority of this project is to establish an infrastructure for a PBRN that will ultimately conduct research. Both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies will be used to measure process, structure, and outcomes of this endeavor.  The documentation of primary health care practice and outcomes in CNCs through the support of practice-based research networks, such as the MNCCRN, will provide critical data to reduce the health disparities currently experienced in vulnerable populations in the United States.

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Intensity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1996, average Medicare per capita expenditures were $3,700 in Minneapolis and $7,783 in Miami. Differences of a similar magnitude were observed across regions in patterns of end-of-life care, such as the chances of dying in a hospital or the number of different specialists seen in the last 6 months of life. Previous research indicates that these geographic variations in treatment are due largely to differences in intensity, i.e., differences in the way similar patients are treated. Improved understanding of the causes and consequences of regional variations in intensity could have important implications for the health and well-being of the elderly, for addressing health disparities and for the financial health of the Medicare trust funds. This project addresses these issues by: 1. Measuring how patients of similar illness levels are treated differently across regions with respect to both overall intensity and different dimensions of intensity. 2. Determining the causes of differences in intensity. To what extent are they due to patient preferences for care, physician beliefs, or other factors? Why is it the norm in some regions but not others for elderly patients to experience extensive diagnostic testing for CAD, with subsequent downstream procedures, specialist referrals, and hospitalization? 3. Studying the consequences of greater health care intensity. What is the impact of greater intensity of care on outcomes that include survival, health functioning, and well-being more generally? 4. Seeking to understand how health care intensity, either across regions or over time, affects disparities across socioeconomic groups in health care treatments and outcomes. The project will bring together a cross-disciplinary research team comprised of investigators from the DAWG; the PORT; the Maine Medical Center; the Center for Survey Research in Boston, MA; Massachusetts General Hospital; and the National Bureau of Economic Research.

"OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH GRADIENTS IN HOSPITAL WORKERS:  THE   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                 Socioeconomic gradients in health status are ubiquitous in space, persistent         in time, and pervasive across diverse health outcomes.  Yet little is known of       how they arise, and specifically, how great a contribution is made to them by        working conditions during adult life.  Existing occupational cohort studies,         such as the landmark Whitehall publications, have failed to convince some            observers that work-related ""psychosocial"" exposures, e.g., the degree of            control felt by employees over their jobs, constitute the key causal                 influences responsible for socioeconomic gradients in the health of the              general adult population, especially gradients in chronic disease.  Largely          missing in the debate thus far is high-quality evidence on gradients from            workplaces with a wide range of jobs -- Whitehall, for example, is                   fundamentally an office worker study.  The present proposal is premised on the       view that rich insights into the genesis of such health ""gradients"" may be           gained by studying in detail, over some years, a workplace, such as a                hospital, that has a very wide range of jobs, and of employees from different        social classes.                                                                                                                                                           By far the major ""short-term"" occupational health problem of this workforce,         and many others, is work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) -- a broad       class of outcomes including low back pain and upper extremity injuries, such         as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.  Both psychosocial and                     physical-ergonomic exposures at work are now thought to be joint determinants        of these musculoskeletal problems.  Thus, psychosocial aspects of work are           increasingly recognized as risk factors for both sorts of illness processes:         traumatic and chronic disease.  Yet there appears to be a dearth of research         linking socioeconomic and job-category disparities in the risk of WRMSDs, with       well-known gradients in many longer-term health outcomes, particularly               coronary heart disease and its risk factors (such as hypertension).  The             investigators propose a study to shed light on the nature and multi-factorial        etiology of hospital gradients, across job categories and employee social            class backgrounds, in the occurrence of several potentially work-related             health outcomes in hospitals.  The outcomes studied will be lost-time,               work-related musculoskeletal disorders, non-invasive measures of allostatic          load (salivary cortisol and blood pressure), overall health-related                  quality-of-life and injury-specific functional status, mental health status,         and total sickness/injury absence from work.  The influence of both directly         observed physical-ergonomic factors at work and psychosocial occupational            exposures on socioeconomic gradients in the risk of these conditions will be         assessed.  Finally they propose to examine, through qualitative research             methods, the social contextual factors within participating hospitals, which         influence working conditions.  The study team will also work with a                  labor-management team to develop possible interventions for the problems that        are identified by this study.

"Nursing and Prescriptive Authority: 1900 to the present  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal requests funding to conduct a three year historical investigation on nurses and prescriptive authority in the United States, 1900 to the present. Given (1) the disparity in the accessibility and availability of health care services in both rural and urban settings and (2) changes in the settings in which nurse practitioners (NPs) practice (now including acute and specialty care), it is time to rethink professional roles and responsibilities. In fact, it is imperative that we consider the possibility of expanding prescriptive authority for advanced practice nurses (APNs) in order to use health care personnel effectively. Today, there is considerable controversy among the professions of medicine, nursing and pharmacy and in the state legislatures concerning the issue of granting and/or expanding prescriptive authority for APNs. Nurses must address this issue for the public and the profession, and in some cases, provide testimony to state legislatures. To do so, they need the perspective of nursing history. The history of how nurses have managed patient care by dispensing and furnishing drugs, as well as the outcomes of how nurses have fared with the limited prescriptive authority, must be studied to determine if increasing their prescriptive privileges is indeed a viable solution to improving accessibility to health care while controlling costs. Unless this history is understood, proposed solutions may repeat the problems of the past or complicate matters further. Little is written on this history. In fact, the history is embedded in am assortment of legal cases and other primary documents in archives across the nation. These historical data have not been synthesized and described, nor have they been analyzed in historical context. A social history framework will be used to conduct this research.    Primary sources, chosen as representative case studies, will include legal cases, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists papers, the Frontier Nursing Service collection, archival materials from The Center for Nursing Historical Inquiry at the University of Virginia (UVA), the Lillian Wald Collection at Columbia University, and materials from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). The findings will be analyzed within the history of health care in a changing socio-political, medical, economic, and legal environment. UVA, with its Center for Nursing Historical Inquiry is well positioned to support this project. Recommendations for future legislation will be made.

"CENTER FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS RESEARCH The goal of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to advance knowledge about health related problems of vulnerable populations (e.g., ethnic people of color; women and children; adolescent mothers; the poor; homeless and elderly; substance users; and individuals exposed to hazardous conditions and polluted environments) and, thereby, decrease relative risks, increase resource availability, & improve the health status of these populations. National health priorities aimed at eliminating disparities in health status, reducing health risks, and promoting use of preventive interventions among specified population groups, as outlined in Health People 2010, will be a major focus of the CVPR. A great need exists for development of a CVPR in California (CA), and particularly in Los Angeles County (LAC). The large population, multicultural diversity, and high incidence of poverty make LAC an excellent site for investigating issues related to the health status of vulnerable populations and addressing their social policy implications. Aims of the CVPR include: 1) advancing knowledge about health-related problems of vulnerable populations by supporting ongoing research of investigators and new pilot-feasibility studies designed to improve health status outcomes of diverse vulnerable populations; 2) strengthening the research support and utilization of molecular/cellular/physiologic assays in studies of the risks and health status of vulnerable populations through the Bio-Laboratory Core; 3) enhancing research support and development of supportive community networks in all phases of research with vulnerable populations through the Social Policy and Dissemination Core; and 4) creating mechanisms for interdisciplinary preparation of scientists and collaboration of scientists and collaboration of scientists in biobehavioral research with vulnerable populations involving qualitative and quantitative methodology through activities of the Research Support Core and the Administrative Core. By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of vulnerable research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of vulnerable populations research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center faculty will be able to address important nursing and other practice issues and deliver research results into the community. The design of the CVPR creates a unique scientific interface between biologic and behavioral researchers studying vulnerable populations and facilitates translation of research into community-based programs with implications for social policy. The CVPR will include 12 key faculty members and 12 affiliate members from nursing and other disciplines. A Scientific-Community Advisory Committee composed of renowned scientists and leaders in the community will further strengthen the Center's capabilities.

"Support for Low Income Breastfeeding: Cost and Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Healthy People 2010 included the goal of increasing breastfeeding duration to 7 months for 50% of all mothers.  Other professional and national health organizations and the Health and Human Services Blueprint for Action on Breastfeeding recommended that women breastfeed exclusively for six months.  Increasing breastfeeding among low-income women is a priority, as disparities exist.  Only 20.1% of low-income women (on WIC) breastfeed for six months compared to 40.7% of more affluent women.  Consistent, comprehensive, culturally sensitive breastfeeding support increases duration of breastfeeding; thus offering well-documented health benefits often specifically appropriate for low-income women.  Breastfeeding relates to lower formula cost, lower health care costs, and breastfeeding may be less time consuming.  These cost savings can potentially offset costs of breastfeeding promotion.  Facilitating breastfeeding among low-income women includes comprehensive and culturally relevant support in the hospital, during the first week postpartum, and periodic support in the mother's home.  Nearly 35% of low-income women stop breastfeeding within eight days of delivery.  Repeated contact with supportive persons such as peer counselors and nurses, affects the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding practice after the immediate postpartum period.  However, support for low-income women has been neglected and not made available because of generally unsubstantiated claims that it is not cost effective.  For this project the broad long-term objective is to determine the net cost savings of improved breastfeeding outcomes resulting from a community health nurse/peer counselor breastfeeding intervention.

"Bridges to the Doctorate for Minority Nursing Students    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Doctorally prepared minority nurses constituted 6.9% (n=1,167) of U.S. doctorally prepared nurses in 2000 while the percentage of the minority population in the States was projected to be 23% (1995 census report). This disproportionately small number of minority nurse scholars, together with the recent report (2002) on health disparities between the minority Americans and whites in the States clearly indicate the need for increasing doctorally prepared minority nurse researchers who will educate future nurses and conduct research on health problems with cultural sensitivity. The long-term objective of this training program is to increase the pool of doctorally prepared minority faculties. Four specific aims collectively are designed to help master's students at partner schools (partners) prepare for doctoral study at UIC CON by gaining appropriate scientific knowledge, research skills, and professional socialization. Enhancing academic environment of the partner schools is also one component to achieve successful retention and transfer of master's students to UIC College of Nursing (CON). Specific aim #1 is to offer UIC CON programs of teaching and research training for master's students at two partners; #2 is to provide academic counseling/professional socialization and mentoring for master's students at partners; #3 is to enhance the curriculum of partners' programs in preparing students for the biomedical and/or behavioral research and for cultural competency; and #4 is to stimulate and enhance academic environment for increased collaborative research activities between the faculties of the partner schools and UIC. Four master's students will be recruited each year. UIC CON has excellent wet and dry laboratories and community resources with 55 externally funded research and training grants (31 from NIH). Most faculty members will be available as faculty sponsors and collaborators. Campus housing will be available and study space for students will be provided. Financial support will be provided for partner master's students that include traineeships, fellowships, or research assistantships with stipends for their doctoral study. UIC CON faculty will sponsor pre-doctoral fellowship applications to NIH, as soon the students are ready. An increased number of minority students in the UIC PhD nursing program will enrich the learning environment with diverse cultures and values.         ",Bridges to the Doctorate for Minority Nursing Students,6593643,R25GM067590,"['curriculum ', ' training ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' minority health professional ', ' postgraduate nursing education ', ' academic achievement ', ' social cooperation ', ' culture ', ' role model ', ' science education ', ' Internet ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R25,2003,214859,0.012329477835685585
"Literacy Development in English Language Learners DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research analyzes the development of reading skills in a sample of low SES, Latino, Spanish speaking English language learners. This population is at risk for low literacy attainment. A preliminary longitudinal study conducted in the same school district (1999 - 2002) found children with limited English proficiency (LEP) participating in a multisensory phonics-based early-exit bilingual program had mean reading scores in the average range on nationally normed reading tests in English through grade 2, but were below average on normed measures of English language skill. Funding is sought to follow these children (n=225) through grade 8. Funding is also sought for a new longitudinal study. Better outcomes might be attained in a phonics-based program that emphasizes oral language to a greater extent (dual language program). The proposed study will follow five groups of children, three LEP and two non-LEP groups. Group 1 (LEP) (n=200) will be in the same early transition bilingual program utilizing multisensory phonics, group 2 (n=200) will be in a dual language program utilizing similar teaching methods, and group 3 (n=200) will be in English immersion (by parental request). Group 4 (non-LEP) (n=100) will be in the dual language program and group 5 (non-LEP) (n=100) will be in regular English instruction. A predictive test battery in Spanish, with measures of oral language skill, phonological skill, nonverbal ability and initial literacy, will be given in Spring of kindergarten. Family demographics and literacy practices in the home will be assessed. Follow-up measures of oral language, phonological skill, word reading, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and academic content knowledge will be given in both English and Spanish at the end of each grade (1 through 4th). School achievement test data will also be collected. Non-random assignment precludes drawing causal inferences about relative instructional effectiveness, but the results will indicate the extent to which English language learners in the three models of instruction attain normative levels of oral language and literacy, and how they compare to local English-speaking children. Correlational data from grades K-4 will be used to determine the characteristics of children who fail to attain average levels of English literacy within and across the 5 groups under study (e.g., based on type of program, phonological skill and exposure to literacy practices in the home).

The mission of the Center will be guided by a conceptual framework that makes explicit the variables of interest that influence health disparities and the mechanism the Center will use to impact the ultimate outcome of reducing health disparities. The Center will act as a catalyst for research on the variables affecting health disparities. The mechanism includes the recruitment, selection and mentoring of faculty using the expert knowledge of the Advisory Committee and senior faculty of both institutions. The Center will knit together a set of pilot studies each year of the grant that advance the knowledge about health disparities and knowledge about best practices to eliminate health disparities. The Center will channel the knowledge discovered via its mentoring and dissemination core.   The variables of interest for the Center are clustered into five dimensions: Determinants of Health; Effects on Population Health Resulting from Health Disparities; Health Care Needs Resulting from Health Disparities; Policy and System Supports for the Elimination of Health Disparities; and Health Status Data, Trends in Disparities, and Best Approaches.

"Race, Ethnicity and Quality of Health Care for Newborns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous studies have examined factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes for newborns.  An issue that has not been well studied is variation in the use of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and variation in the use of high quality hospitals.  Studies in other areas (e.g. cardiac care) document large racial and ethnic disparities in treatment use and use of high quality providers, raising questions about the role that this might play in newborn outcome disparities as well.  We will study racial and ethnic variation in use of NICUs, particularly the use of advanced and high volume NICUs, and use of high quality hospitals by newborns, particularly LBW and VLBW newborns, using secondary datasets that link vital statistics and hospital discharge data for all births in 7 states over most of the 1990s.  Our analysis of high quality hospital use will be based on new measures of hospital quality based on patient outcomes that we will develop using new and innovative methods.  Our main analysis is designed to achieve 3 specific aims: 1) to investigate the extent of differences in use of NICUs and high volume facilities by race and ethnicity, and examine the correlates of differences in utilization rates; 2) to construct new outcome-based indicators of the quality of hospital care for newborns, and examine variations in the quality of hospitals at which newborns of different races and ethnicities are born or to which they are transferred, and to examine the correlates of differences; and 3) to examine the effect of differences in access to NICUs, high volume facilities, and high quality hospitals on disparities in health outcomes for newborns by race and ethnicity. The datasets we will use also afford more extensive opportunities to control for co-morbidities and other risk factors than have been available in previous large-scale analyses of newborn outcome disparities, as well as presenting the opportunity to study the role played by geographic (""small area"") variations in newborn outcome disparities.  As we conduct our analysis of disparities in NICU and high quality hospital use, we will also apply these capabilities of the new datasets to the study of disparities, working to achieve specific aim 4: to use the new linked databases to extend work on racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes for newborns, particularly accounting for variations in co-morbidities and other risk factors, newly available in the new linked datasets, and studying effects of variation across geographic areas.  Our work will focus on Black-White differences, disparities for Hispanics (including subgroups like Mexican and Puerto Rican), and disparities for Asian and Pacific Islanders.         ","Race, Ethnicity and Quality of Health Care for Newborns",6735706,R01HD044003,"['newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service availability ', ' neonatal intensive care ', ' hospital analysis ', ' Asian American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' human data ', ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,405943,0.04557916877780101
"Literacy Development in English Language Learners DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research analyzes the development of reading skills in a sample of low SES, Latino, Spanish speaking English language learners. This population is at risk for low literacy attainment. A preliminary longitudinal study conducted in the same school district (1999 - 2002) found children with limited English proficiency (LEP) participating in a multisensory phonics-based early-exit bilingual program had mean reading scores in the average range on nationally normed reading tests in English through grade 2, but were below average on normed measures of English language skill. Funding is sought to follow these children (n=225) through grade 8. Funding is also sought for a new longitudinal study. Better outcomes might be attained in a phonics-based program that emphasizes oral language to a greater extent (dual language program). The proposed study will follow five groups of children, three LEP and two non-LEP groups. Group 1 (LEP) (n=200) will be in the same early transition bilingual program utilizing multisensory phonics, group 2 (n=200) will be in a dual language program utilizing similar teaching methods, and group 3 (n=200) will be in English immersion (by parental request). Group 4 (non-LEP) (n=100) will be in the dual language program and group 5 (non-LEP) (n=100) will be in regular English instruction. A predictive test battery in Spanish, with measures of oral language skill, phonological skill, nonverbal ability and initial literacy, will be given in Spring of kindergarten. Family demographics and literacy practices in the home will be assessed. Follow-up measures of oral language, phonological skill, word reading, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and academic content knowledge will be given in both English and Spanish at the end of each grade (1 through 4th). School achievement test data will also be collected. Non-random assignment precludes drawing causal inferences about relative instructional effectiveness, but the results will indicate the extent to which English language learners in the three models of instruction attain normative levels of oral language and literacy, and how they compare to local English-speaking children. Correlational data from grades K-4 will be used to determine the characteristics of children who fail to attain average levels of English literacy within and across the 5 groups under study (e.g., based on type of program, phonological skill and exposure to literacy practices in the home).

"Virgin Islands Export Center for Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to develop the Caribbean Export Center for Research and Education in Health Disparities in the Virgin Islands of the United States. The proposed Center will develop resources and the infrastructure needed to expand research capacity in education and health that will support interdisciplinary projects to reduce disparities in health status for health disparity populations in the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John). The Center will be located at the University of the Virgin Islands within the Division of Nursing. The University of the Virgin Islands is the only HBCU outside the continental U.S. Its baccalaureate nursing program is the only program in the territories preparing health professionals. A very sparse literature suggests that residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands have significant rates of heart disease, diabetes, HIV infection, infant mortality and other health disparities. However, beyond sketchy prevalence data incorporated in national reports, few studies have described factors that might be associated with reported prevalence rates. The population of the U.S. Virgin Islands is highly diverse with African American, African Carribean and Hispanics comprising 80% of the population. Access to care, lack of health insurance, limited education and poverty may represent significant barriers to health promotion and prevention activities that could ultimately reduce health disparities within our islands. Yet we will need to increase the capacity of faculty and community representatives to conduct disparity research that includes focused studies that incorporate island history, context, culture, access and other factors contributing to these disparities within the islands. The leadership, capacity building and other developmental activities described in this application reflect the underlying commitment of the University and our collaborating partners to improve our ability to address health disparities in the U.S. Virgin Islands more effectively.

"Overcoming Barriers to Early Phase Clinical Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   This application addresses the low accrual rates of minorities to early (Phase I - Phase II) cancer clinical trials. We have identified low referral rates of minority patients to the hospitals comprising the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, a consortium of the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Massachusetts General Hospital, as a major barrier to recruitment of minority patients to early phase trials. Historically, eight percent of our 15,000 new patients each year come from minority communities, and 6-8% of patients entering our early clinical trials are minorities. To address the problem of low referral rates, we propose to establish a system for expediting referral of patients from community medical oncology practice at the Cambridge Hospital. Dr. Lisa Weissmann, a member of the Harvard Medical School faculty, is the primary provider of care for 400 new cases of cancer each year, as referred from the Cambridge Health Alliance, a network of 15 community health centers in Cambridge. Her practice serves a largely (70 percent) minority population, fewer than 5 of whom are referred to academic health centers for clinical trials, Dr. Weissmann will partner with the Experimental Therapeutics Program of the DF/HCC to establish a simplified, navigator based referral system to the DF/HCC, with the object of referring 40 patients per year to our hospitals for early drug trials. The system will contain the following elements: (1) a practice based navigator at Cambridge Hospital, who will be responsible for making direct contacts with the an Early Trials Office at the DF/HCC, (2) a fund to provide travel and day care for patients coming to the DF/HCC from Cambridge Hospital, (3) an on-line protocol information system (Oncpro) to be extended to Dr. Weissmann's office, providing up to the date information on protocols open and eligibility requirements, (4) culturally relevant literature and information in Spanish, Portuguese, and Creole/French, available in Cambridge and at DF/HCC, (5) an extensive program to ensure coordination of efforts between Cambridge and the DF/HCC staffs, and training in cultural sensitivity for DFIHCC staff, and (6) an evaluation of accrual, disposition of referrals, and patient satisfaction, with refinement of existing satisfaction surveys.

"OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH GRADIENTS IN HOSPITAL WORKERS:  THE   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                 Socioeconomic gradients in health status are ubiquitous in space, persistent         in time, and pervasive across diverse health outcomes.  Yet little is known of       how they arise, and specifically, how great a contribution is made to them by        working conditions during adult life.  Existing occupational cohort studies,         such as the landmark Whitehall publications, have failed to convince some            observers that work-related ""psychosocial"" exposures, e.g., the degree of            control felt by employees over their jobs, constitute the key causal                 influences responsible for socioeconomic gradients in the health of the              general adult population, especially gradients in chronic disease.  Largely          missing in the debate thus far is high-quality evidence on gradients from            workplaces with a wide range of jobs -- Whitehall, for example, is                   fundamentally an office worker study.  The present proposal is premised on the       view that rich insights into the genesis of such health ""gradients"" may be           gained by studying in detail, over some years, a workplace, such as a                hospital, that has a very wide range of jobs, and of employees from different        social classes.                                                                                                                                                           By far the major ""short-term"" occupational health problem of this workforce,         and many others, is work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) -- a broad       class of outcomes including low back pain and upper extremity injuries, such         as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.  Both psychosocial and                     physical-ergonomic exposures at work are now thought to be joint determinants        of these musculoskeletal problems.  Thus, psychosocial aspects of work are           increasingly recognized as risk factors for both sorts of illness processes:         traumatic and chronic disease.  Yet there appears to be a dearth of research         linking socioeconomic and job-category disparities in the risk of WRMSDs, with       well-known gradients in many longer-term health outcomes, particularly               coronary heart disease and its risk factors (such as hypertension).  The             investigators propose a study to shed light on the nature and multi-factorial        etiology of hospital gradients, across job categories and employee social            class backgrounds, in the occurrence of several potentially work-related             health outcomes in hospitals.  The outcomes studied will be lost-time,               work-related musculoskeletal disorders, non-invasive measures of allostatic          load (salivary cortisol and blood pressure), overall health-related                  quality-of-life and injury-specific functional status, mental health status,         and total sickness/injury absence from work.  The influence of both directly         observed physical-ergonomic factors at work and psychosocial occupational            exposures on socioeconomic gradients in the risk of these conditions will be         assessed.  Finally they propose to examine, through qualitative research             methods, the social contextual factors within participating hospitals, which         influence working conditions.  The study team will also work with a                  labor-management team to develop possible interventions for the problems that        are identified by this study.

"Nursing Research Center on HIV/AIDS Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA-NR-004, Nursing Partnership Centers on Health Disparities, linking the Schools of Nursing at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the University of Puerto Rico (UPR). The goal of this work is to enhance the knowledge base for nursing care in order to improve the quality of lives of people living with and affected by HIV disease. The long-term goal of the Center is to ensure the independence of the partnering Minority Serving Institution (MSI), namely the University of Puerto Rico, School of Nursing. The groups most affected with new cases of HIV/AIDS are racial/ethnic minorities, women, and the poor -the very groups, which have less access to health care services. The San Francisco Bay Area and the Island of Puerto Rico are among the geographic areas that have the highest per capita incidence of HIV/AIDS in the United States. At the UCSF School of Nursing there exists a strong interest in and a critical mass of investigators studying HIV/AIDS in minorities, women, and the poor. And, there is a cadre of faculty from the School of Nursing, University of Puerto Rico, likewise interested in HIV/AIDS research and an environment conducive to research development and training. This application proposes to establish the Nursing Research Center on HIV/AIDS Health Disparities to achieve the following aims: (1) to expand the number of nurse researchers involved in research on HIV/AIDS health disparities; (2) to increase the number of research projects aimed at reducing health disparities in HIV disease; and, (3) to enhance the career development of minority nurse investigators.         ",Nursing Research Center on HIV/AIDS Disparities,6770143,P20NR008359,"['Puerto Rico ', ' HIV infection ', ' nursing research ', ' nursing care ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P20,2004,249975,0.09437755859522308

"EXAMINING NURSING HOME COMPARE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to research topic number 22 (Racial/Ethnic Differences and Health Disparities) as outlined in the NIA Pilot Research Program. Specifically, we wish to examine ""research to develop and improve instruments and methods ... in minority groups"" (PAR-03-056: pg.4). The proposed analyses have the potential to influence policy and practices - and ultimately help consumers (especially minorities) choose a nursing facility.  Lack of reliability and validity assessment has recently been identified for Nursing Home Compare (NHC) - a national report card for nursing homes. With the exception of a recent GAO report describing this initiative, we could not identify any research on NHC. This includes finding no research on the applicability of NHC for minority groups. So despite the unquestionable need for this report card, some research in this area is clearly warranted. In this proposal, we focus on the impact of NHC on family members of elders who were recently placed in a nursing home. NHC is intended to provide assistance to these consumers in choosing nursing homes.  Our hypothesis is that public dissemination of nursing home quality through the NHC report card has helped family members in choosing a nursing facility, but is less helpful for minorities. In examining this hypothesis, we will determine which components of the report card (content, comprehension, navigation, or decision making) are most/least helpful in choosing a nursing facility and whether any specific improvements can be made so that the report card information can help both minorities and non-minorities.

"Nursing and Prescriptive Authority: 1900 to the present  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal requests funding to conduct a three year historical investigation on nurses and prescriptive authority in the United States, 1900 to the present. Given (1) the disparity in the accessibility and availability of health care services in both rural and urban settings and (2) changes in the settings in which nurse practitioners (NPs) practice (now including acute and specialty care), it is time to rethink professional roles and responsibilities. In fact, it is imperative that we consider the possibility of expanding prescriptive authority for advanced practice nurses (APNs) in order to use health care personnel effectively. Today, there is considerable controversy among the professions of medicine, nursing and pharmacy and in the state legislatures concerning the issue of granting and/or expanding prescriptive authority for APNs. Nurses must address this issue for the public and the profession, and in some cases, provide testimony to state legislatures. To do so, they need the perspective of nursing history. The history of how nurses have managed patient care by dispensing and furnishing drugs, as well as the outcomes of how nurses have fared with the limited prescriptive authority, must be studied to determine if increasing their prescriptive privileges is indeed a viable solution to improving accessibility to health care while controlling costs. Unless this history is understood, proposed solutions may repeat the problems of the past or complicate matters further. Little is written on this history. In fact, the history is embedded in am assortment of legal cases and other primary documents in archives across the nation. These historical data have not been synthesized and described, nor have they been analyzed in historical context. A social history framework will be used to conduct this research.    Primary sources, chosen as representative case studies, will include legal cases, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists papers, the Frontier Nursing Service collection, archival materials from The Center for Nursing Historical Inquiry at the University of Virginia (UVA), the Lillian Wald Collection at Columbia University, and materials from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). The findings will be analyzed within the history of health care in a changing socio-political, medical, economic, and legal environment. UVA, with its Center for Nursing Historical Inquiry is well positioned to support this project. Recommendations for future legislation will be made.

"Center for Vulnerable Populations Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to enhance strengths of communities to eliminate health disparities faced by vulnerable populations (VPs), with a particular focus on ethnic/racial minorities and people living in poverty. The CVPR has facilitated sharing and expanding resources to improve the competence of investigators studying health problems of VPs, to support ongoing evolution of the knowledge base and methods of VP research, and to develop collaborative relations with community partners. Goals of the CVPR in the next five years are to: 1) continue expanding the scientific knowledge base of health-related problems of VPs to a) reduce/eliminate health disparities; b) facilitate health promotion; and c) improve outcomes of nursing practice; 2) translate the knowledge, skills, and experience acquired in participatory research (PR) methods and community partnerships by university and community investigators into practice/action to improve the health status of VPs and to develop science in this area; 3) expand capacity to measure, analyze and link biologic and behavioral markers in VPs research; and 4) disseminate research findings to inform community partners, and to influence nursing, health policy development, ethical decision- making processes, and future research. The infrastructure of the CVPR supports achievement of these goals through a variety of research and educational activities conducted by 4 cores - Administrative, Bio Laboratory, Participatory Research and Community Partnerships (PRCPC) and Research Support. Over the past four years the interdisciplinary team of CVPR investigators and affiliates have established several community partnerships and university collaborations and developed a unique scientific interface between behavioral and biologic researchers studying VPs. By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of VP research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center Investigators are effectively addressing important health and nursing issues. The community-based partnerships provide a solid foundation for further development of the CVPR as an epicenter for research and training in community-based PR to reduce health disparities. Current and planned CVPR research addresses elimination of health disparities in areas related to infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A/B/C, tuberculosis), chronic illness (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma) substance use, and environmental quality. Continuance of the CVPR will enable investigators to sustain and expand efforts to confront health disparities in Los Angeles and the nation, to address national health goals established by several governmental agencies, and to build community capacity.

"Racial Disparity in Access High Quality Cardiac Surgeons DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities in access to high quality cardiac surgeons among the elderly Racial disparities in access to health care services is a well documented, if poorly understood, persistent characteristic of the American health care system. Inadequate access to services by racial minorities, as it leads to poor health outcomes and poor health, has become an important part of our national health policy agenda. Racial minorities have been shown to be less likely to receive cardiac surgery. Even when they gain access to surgery, they are still disadvantaged because they access surgeons with higher risk-adjusted mortality rates (RAMR), compared to whites.      These issues are of particular importance to the elderly population, as heart disease is one of the major morbidities in this population, it is the leading cause of death and over 50% of CABG surgeries are performed on individuals aged 65 and older. The proposed study is designed to test specific hypotheses about the factors contributing to the observed disparities in access to high quality cardiac surgeons. It will test hypotheses related to three referral decisions foci: the patient, the referring physician and the managed care organization (MCO). The population studied will include all Medicare patients undergoing CABG surgery, all cardiac surgeons and hospitals in NYS. Medicare CABG patients will be surveyed about their use of RAMR information and their encounter with the referring physician. Medicare claims for medical care encounters prior to the surgery will be used to analyze referral patterns. NYS SPARCS data and MCO information, as well as a unique data set with information about contracting patterns of MCOs with hospitals and cardiac surgeons, will be used to study the effect of MCOs on racial disparities in access. Statistical multivariate regression techniques will be used to analyze the data. The knowledge gained in this project is essential for development of targeted programs that could successfully address the disparity in access to high quality cardiac care among elderly racial minorities.

"Regulatory Reform and Angiography Disparties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Beginning in 1996, New Jersey embarked on hospital regulatory reforms that addressed, among other goals, the long-standing problem of racial and ethnic disparities in use of cardiac angiography (CA). These reforms led to a doubling in the number of hospitals performing CA as well as state-monitoring of minority outreach and access activities for CA services at each hospital. This proposal builds on AHRQ-funded pilot studies to examine the effectiveness of this innovative policy. Specific aims are to: (1) determine whether the disparity between black and white CA utilization declined following implementation of NJ policies intended to expand access for minority patients, (2) evaluate how local health system characteristics may influence CA disparities and the pathways through which the NJ policy may have reduced these disparities; and (3) identify promising strategies for reducing CA disparities. Hispanic-white CA disparities will also be investigated. Quantitative modeling and qualitative analyses will be blended to evaluate CA disparity trends from 1993-2003 in contrast to trends in a non-reform state. Primary outcome measures are the white-black difference in age-sex adjusted CA rates in small areas and the volume and share of CA utilization by black patients at NJ hospitals that provided CA throughout the study period. Regression methods will be used to adjust for market area demographics and other factors. Hypotheses about the effects of changes in CA capacity and hospital competition will be tested. CA facilities that demonstrate higher-than-expected levels of service to black patients, based on regression models, will be selected for intensive case studies along with a set of matched comparison facilities that are not high performing. The case studies will be focused on the market areas of the selected facilities, and will include documentary review and semi-structured interviews of officials from the selected CA facilities, referring hospitals, community health centers and other players in the case markets. Research findings will be translated to the practice and policy community in the form of ""best practices"" and through feedback of hospital-specific CA disparity performance measures.            ",Regulatory Reform and Angiography Disparties,6762648,R01HS014191,"['cardiovascular imaging /visualization ', ' angiography ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' data collection ', ' interview ', ' mathematical model ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",AHRQ,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2004,405433,0.043825178310024214

"Southwest Center: Partners in Health Disparity Resaearch    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the prevalence of health disparities resulting from geographic location, income, and race/ethnicity; the lack of research on health promotion in racial and ethnic minorities; and the paucity of nurses and nurse scientists among racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., it is critical to focus efforts on expanding the preparation of nurses and nurse scientists from minority populations and on expanding research aimed at improving health and health care. The proposed Southwest Partnership Center for Nursing Research on Health Disparities (SWPC) will focus on health disparities in rural, low-income, Mexican-American, and/or American-Indian populations. Specific aims are 1) Establish the Southwest Partnership Center for Nursing Research on Health Disparities within the formal structure of the School of Nursing at The University of Texas at Austin and the formal structure of the Department of Nursing in the minority-serving institution of New Mexico State University; 2) Build capacity for nursing research on health disparities experienced by populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian by increasing the number of nurse researchers in the two partnering institutions conducting studies within a health promotion framework; 3) Increase the number and quality of studies by nursing faculty and undergraduate and graduate students in the partnering institutions that focus on reducing or eliminating health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian within a health promotion framework; 4) Enhance the research career development of minority nurse investigators, including undergraduate and graduate nursing students and faculty at both partnering institutions, with particular emphasis on addressing minority health and health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian using a health promotion framework; and 5) increase the number of research projects proposed by nursing faculty and students in the partnering institutions that involve interdisciplinary collaboration and that focus on reducing health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian within a health promotion framework.         ",Southwest Center: Partners in Health Disparity Resaearch,6771052,P20NR008352,"['cooperative study ', ' health science research potential ', ' nursing research ', ' Native American ', ' Mexican American ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NINR,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,P20,2004,153420,0.052666347360359266
"NRP and Neonatal Outcomes in Rural Hospitals    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The challenges of providing health services in rural settings are quite unique and few professionals are educated to function in the generalist role required in rural areas. This challenge is compounded by disparities in health status of rural Americans, one of which is the continued elevated neonatal mortality rate. Little is known about factors that influence outcomes for neonates requiring resuscitation who are born in rural hospitals. Much of the variability in the rural neonatal mortality remains unexplained and it is possible that differences in care practices may account for some of that variation. The purpose of this project is to explain variability in newborn morbidity and mortality as a function of provider care quality and hospital maternity unity characteristics. Twenty rural hospitals from two Midwestern states will be selected at random without replacement for study participation. At each hospital, nurse managers will provide information about obstetrical unit characteristics (structure). Physicians and nurses (approximately 30 per hospital) who provide care to neonates at birth will provide demographic data, describe past experiences and comfort when performing skills required during resuscitation, and participate in a knowledge survey. Birth logs from each unit will be used to gather data for newborns (approximately 120) and identify the healthcare providers present at delivery. A hierarchical linear model will be used to estimate parameters of a statistical model that links birthing unit preparedness (structure) and provider readiness (process) to very early neonatal health status (outcome).         ",NRP and Neonatal Outcomes in Rural Hospitals,6802480,R36HS014516,"['infant mortality ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' health care quality ', ' hospital patient care ', ' resuscitation ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care service planning ', ' physician ', ' hospital analysis ', ' hospital equipment /supply ', ' human subject ', ' nurse ', ' human morbidity ', ' rural area ', ' human data ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' rural health ', ' ']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R36,2004,25536,0.030390341201542152
"The Impact of HMO's on Disparties  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health care represent key contributors to racial/ethnic disparities in health.  Although racial and ethnic disparities have been extensively documented across the continuum of health care, relatively little is known about the impact of HMOs on these disparities.  On one hand, improved accountability for population-wide health care quality and strategies designed to constrain over-utilization may help HMOs to reduce disparities.  On the other hand, more stringent cost containment efforts by HMOs may impose barriers to care for vulnerable populations.  Under current HEDIS reporting requirements such disparities go undetected.   The primary aim of this three-year project is to assess the scope and magnitude of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in HMOs.  We will aggregate several years using the following national surveys:  The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey, and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.  We will develop age, sex, and casemix adjusted utilization and quality measures that examine racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in preventive care, satisfaction, change in health status, use of expensive hospital-based procedures, and avoidable hospital Complications and mortality.  We will compare disparities in these measures between HMO and non-HMO members and assess changes overtime.   Findings from this project should inform AHRQ's National Disparities Reporting.  Because the measures will be derived from periodic national surveys, progress towards the elimination of disparities can be tracked over time using future iterations of these surveys and measures.  If the study hypotheses are confirmed, the findings will underscore the need for HMOs to track and address disparities among their members if the Healthy People 2010 for the elimination of disparities is to be achieved.

"Bridges to the Doctorate for Minority Nursing Students    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Doctorally prepared minority nurses constituted 6.9% (n=1,167) of U.S. doctorally prepared nurses in 2000 while the percentage of the minority population in the States was projected to be 23% (1995 census report). This disproportionately small number of minority nurse scholars, together with the recent report (2002) on health disparities between the minority Americans and whites in the States clearly indicate the need for increasing doctorally prepared minority nurse researchers who will educate future nurses and conduct research on health problems with cultural sensitivity. The long-term objective of this training program is to increase the pool of doctorally prepared minority faculties. Four specific aims collectively are designed to help master's students at partner schools (partners) prepare for doctoral study at UIC CON by gaining appropriate scientific knowledge, research skills, and professional socialization. Enhancing academic environment of the partner schools is also one component to achieve successful retention and transfer of master's students to UIC College of Nursing (CON). Specific aim #1 is to offer UIC CON programs of teaching and research training for master's students at two partners; #2 is to provide academic counseling/professional socialization and mentoring for master's students at partners; #3 is to enhance the curriculum of partners' programs in preparing students for the biomedical and/or behavioral research and for cultural competency; and #4 is to stimulate and enhance academic environment for increased collaborative research activities between the faculties of the partner schools and UIC. Four master's students will be recruited each year. UIC CON has excellent wet and dry laboratories and community resources with 55 externally funded research and training grants (31 from NIH). Most faculty members will be available as faculty sponsors and collaborators. Campus housing will be available and study space for students will be provided. Financial support will be provided for partner master's students that include traineeships, fellowships, or research assistantships with stipends for their doctoral study. UIC CON faculty will sponsor pre-doctoral fellowship applications to NIH, as soon the students are ready. An increased number of minority students in the UIC PhD nursing program will enrich the learning environment with diverse cultures and values.         ",Bridges to the Doctorate for Minority Nursing Students,6743661,R25GM067590,"['curriculum ', ' training ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' minority health professional ', ' postgraduate nursing education ', ' academic achievement ', ' social cooperation ', ' culture ', ' role model ', ' science education ', ' Internet ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R25,2004,232125,0.012329477835685585
"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Intensity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1996, average Medicare per capita expenditures were $3,700 in Minneapolis and $7,783 in Miami. Differences of a similar magnitude were observed across regions in patterns of end-of-life care, such as the chances of dying in a hospital or the number of different specialists seen in the last 6 months of life. Previous research indicates that these geographic variations in treatment are due largely to differences in intensity, i.e., differences in the way similar patients are treated. Improved understanding of the causes and consequences of regional variations in intensity could have important implications for the health and well-being of the elderly, for addressing health disparities and for the financial health of the Medicare trust funds. This project addresses these issues by: 1. Measuring how patients of similar illness levels are treated differently across regions with respect to both overall intensity and different dimensions of intensity. 2. Determining the causes of differences in intensity. To what extent are they due to patient preferences for care, physician beliefs, or other factors? Why is it the norm in some regions but not others for elderly patients to experience extensive diagnostic testing for CAD, with subsequent downstream procedures, specialist referrals, and hospitalization? 3. Studying the consequences of greater health care intensity. What is the impact of greater intensity of care on outcomes that include survival, health functioning, and well-being more generally? 4. Seeking to understand how health care intensity, either across regions or over time, affects disparities across socioeconomic groups in health care treatments and outcomes. The project will bring together a cross-disciplinary research team comprised of investigators from the DAWG; the PORT; the Maine Medical Center; the Center for Survey Research in Boston, MA; Massachusetts General Hospital; and the National Bureau of Economic Research.

"Support for Low Income Breastfeeding: Cost and Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Healthy People 2010 included the goal of increasing breastfeeding duration to 7 months for 50% of all mothers.  Other professional and national health organizations and the Health and Human Services Blueprint for Action on Breastfeeding recommended that women breastfeed exclusively for six months.  Increasing breastfeeding among low-income women is a priority, as disparities exist.  Only 20.1% of low-income women (on WIC) breastfeed for six months compared to 40.7% of more affluent women.  Consistent, comprehensive, culturally sensitive breastfeeding support increases duration of breastfeeding; thus offering well-documented health benefits often specifically appropriate for low-income women.  Breastfeeding relates to lower formula cost, lower health care costs, and breastfeeding may be less time consuming.  These cost savings can potentially offset costs of breastfeeding promotion.  Facilitating breastfeeding among low-income women includes comprehensive and culturally relevant support in the hospital, during the first week postpartum, and periodic support in the mother's home.  Nearly 35% of low-income women stop breastfeeding within eight days of delivery.  Repeated contact with supportive persons such as peer counselors and nurses, affects the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding practice after the immediate postpartum period.  However, support for low-income women has been neglected and not made available because of generally unsubstantiated claims that it is not cost effective.  For this project the broad long-term objective is to determine the net cost savings of improved breastfeeding outcomes resulting from a community health nurse/peer counselor breastfeeding intervention.  The breastfeeding intervention will use an enhanced traditional community health nurse/peer counselor home visit, which is no longer usual care for contemporary community health nursing practice, along with community health nurse (CHN)/peer counselor in-hospital and telephone support.  The overall hypothesis is the intervention group will have improved breastfeeding outcomes and will demonstrate a net cost savings over usual care.

"Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is submitted in response to RFA NR -02 0004, Nursing Partnership Centers on Health Disparities Grants. Yale School of Nursing (YSN) and the Howard University Division of Nursing (HUDON) propose to develop a Partnership Center on Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Management. Self-management encompasses a broad range of health, lifestyle, behavioral and self-assessment and treatment activities practiced by an individual in the context of the family, often with the support of nurses. Self and family management activities vary across socioeconomic status, gender and ethnic/cultural background. Within certain groups, disparities exist in risk to health status, access to health care and in treatment outcomes. We believe that self-management represents one promising avenue for eliminating these disparities. With better understanding of self-management approaches in populations experiencing health disparities, nursing interventions can be developed to support self-management and eliminate health disparities. The Center builds on an existing partnership between YSN and HUDON: the federally funded Yale-Howard Scholars Program. The scientific focus of the Partnership Center extends the work of YSN's funded Exploratory Center on Self-Management Interventions for Populations at Risk into the area of disparities. The Partnership Center will build capacity by recruiting and developing nurse scientists to conduct culturally relevant and competent research to eliminate health disparities. The Center will be under the direction of Drs. Catherine Gilliss (YSN) & Dorothy Powell (HUDON), and will include: Administrative Core (Gilliss/Powell; Drs. Grey [YSN] & Nichols [HUDON]); Pilot/Feasibility Core (Drs. Williams YSN] & Austin [Howard University]; Research Mentoring Core (Drs. Funk [YSN] & Ruff [HUDON]; and Research/Outreach Dissemination Core (Drs. McCorkle [YSN] & Jordan [HUDON]). Proposals for four pilot studies are included with this application. In addition to building investigator capacity, our long-term goal includes the establishment of an Office of Research Affairs at HUDON.         ",Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Management,6920703,P20NR008353,"['cooperative study ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' patient care management ', ' family medicine ', ' health science research potential ', ' human subject ', ' nursing research ', ' health behavior ', ' African American ', ' self help ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' experimental design ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NINR,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,P20,2005,266350,0.08056873722623735

"Southwest Center: Partners in Health Disparity Resaearch    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the prevalence of health disparities resulting from geographic location, income, and race/ethnicity; the lack of research on health promotion in racial and ethnic minorities; and the paucity of nurses and nurse scientists among racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., it is critical to focus efforts on expanding the preparation of nurses and nurse scientists from minority populations and on expanding research aimed at improving health and health care. The proposed Southwest Partnership Center for Nursing Research on Health Disparities (SWPC) will focus on health disparities in rural, low-income, Mexican-American, and/or American-Indian populations. Specific aims are 1) Establish the Southwest Partnership Center for Nursing Research on Health Disparities within the formal structure of the School of Nursing at The University of Texas at Austin and the formal structure of the Department of Nursing in the minority-serving institution of New Mexico State University; 2) Build capacity for nursing research on health disparities experienced by populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian by increasing the number of nurse researchers in the two partnering institutions conducting studies within a health promotion framework; 3) Increase the number and quality of studies by nursing faculty and undergraduate and graduate students in the partnering institutions that focus on reducing or eliminating health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian within a health promotion framework; 4) Enhance the research career development of minority nurse investigators, including undergraduate and graduate nursing students and faculty at both partnering institutions, with particular emphasis on addressing minority health and health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian using a health promotion framework; and 5) increase the number of research projects proposed by nursing faculty and students in the partnering institutions that involve interdisciplinary collaboration and that focus on reducing health disparities among populations that are rural, low-income, Mexican American, or American Indian within a health promotion framework.         ",Southwest Center: Partners in Health Disparity Resaearch,6917963,P20NR008352,"['cooperative study ', ' health science research potential ', ' nursing research ', ' Native American ', ' Mexican American ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NINR,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,P20,2005,171422,0.052666347360359266

"Technological Home Care: Improving Caregiving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific aims of this study are to test the effects of a nursing intervention (FamTechCare) on family caregivers' problem solving ability, participation in health care management, health status, depression, quality of life, and health care services costs. Subjects in the study will be family caregivers (n= 80) and 80 adult patients dependent for survival on Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) infusions due to nonmalignant gastrointestinal disorders. Recruitment is through Kansas University Hospital and its rural outreach centers. Enrollment will be staggered over the project in order to assure adequate numbers and representative gender and racial distributions. Research methods include a placebo-controlled longitudinal clinical trial design with crossover and interventions delivered by videophone nurse visits, internet-based home care algorithm guides and by peer support. Peers are family caregivers with extensive HPN experience who will be trained to mentor dyads via videophone. These FamTechCare interventions are based on extensive preliminary data and include new, innovative extensions for this study. The entire intervention was pilot- tested and found feasible and not a burden. Questionnaires and laboratory data used to obtain pre- and post-intervention data are valid, sensitive to change and reliable and were completed in an average 20 minutes during pilot testing. Data analyses will include nested linear mixed model hypothesis testing to detect effects on caregiver/patient dyads. The novel concept of nurse caring conveyed via internet is also tested. Traditional cost analysis and the, innovative Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) will be used to describe each family's home care efficiency in relation to and health services costs. This study uses videophone and internet delivery which increases health care access and reduces health care disparities. The potential significance and the long term goals are to strengthen home caregiving skills, improve health status, quality of life and self-management of chronic illness symptoms and invasive home care treatment.         ",Technological Home Care: Improving Caregiving,7028503,R01NR009078,"['telemedicine ', ' clinical trial ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' health care quality ', ' caregiver ', ' home health care ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' mathematical model ', ' nursing intervention ', ' parenteral feeding ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' depression ', ' peer group ', ' social support network ', ' quality of life ', ' Internet ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2005,523676,0.018432884626123476
"Race, Ethnicity and Quality of Health Care for Newborns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous studies have examined factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes for newborns.  An issue that has not been well studied is variation in the use of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and variation in the use of high quality hospitals.  Studies in other areas (e.g. cardiac care) document large racial and ethnic disparities in treatment use and use of high quality providers, raising questions about the role that this might play in newborn outcome disparities as well.  We will study racial and ethnic variation in use of NICUs, particularly the use of advanced and high volume NICUs, and use of high quality hospitals by newborns, particularly LBW and VLBW newborns, using secondary datasets that link vital statistics and hospital discharge data for all births in 7 states over most of the 1990s.  Our analysis of high quality hospital use will be based on new measures of hospital quality based on patient outcomes that we will develop using new and innovative methods.  Our main analysis is designed to achieve 3 specific aims: 1) to investigate the extent of differences in use of NICUs and high volume facilities by race and ethnicity, and examine the correlates of differences in utilization rates; 2) to construct new outcome-based indicators of the quality of hospital care for newborns, and examine variations in the quality of hospitals at which newborns of different races and ethnicities are born or to which they are transferred, and to examine the correlates of differences; and 3) to examine the effect of differences in access to NICUs, high volume facilities, and high quality hospitals on disparities in health outcomes for newborns by race and ethnicity. The datasets we will use also afford more extensive opportunities to control for co-morbidities and other risk factors than have been available in previous large-scale analyses of newborn outcome disparities, as well as presenting the opportunity to study the role played by geographic (""small area"") variations in newborn outcome disparities.  As we conduct our analysis of disparities in NICU and high quality hospital use, we will also apply these capabilities of the new datasets to the study of disparities, working to achieve specific aim 4: to use the new linked databases to extend work on racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes for newborns, particularly accounting for variations in co-morbidities and other risk factors, newly available in the new linked datasets, and studying effects of variation across geographic areas.  Our work will focus on Black-White differences, disparities for Hispanics (including subgroups like Mexican and Puerto Rican), and disparities for Asian and Pacific Islanders.         ","Race, Ethnicity and Quality of Health Care for Newborns",6881653,R01HD044003,"['newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service availability ', ' neonatal intensive care ', ' hospital analysis ', ' Asian American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' human data ', ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,409819,0.04557916877780101

"EXAMINING NURSING HOME COMPARE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to research topic number 22 (Racial/Ethnic Differences and Health Disparities) as outlined in the NIA Pilot Research Program. Specifically, we wish to examine ""research to develop and improve instruments and methods ... in minority groups"" (PAR-03-056: pg.4). The proposed analyses have the potential to influence policy and practices - and ultimately help consumers (especially minorities) choose a nursing facility.  Lack of reliability and validity assessment has recently been identified for Nursing Home Compare (NHC) - a national report card for nursing homes. With the exception of a recent GAO report describing this initiative, we could not identify any research on NHC. This includes finding no research on the applicability of NHC for minority groups. So despite the unquestionable need for this report card, some research in this area is clearly warranted. In this proposal, we focus on the impact of NHC on family members of elders who were recently placed in a nursing home. NHC is intended to provide assistance to these consumers in choosing nursing homes.  Our hypothesis is that public dissemination of nursing home quality through the NHC report card has helped family members in choosing a nursing facility, but is less helpful for minorities. In examining this hypothesis, we will determine which components of the report card (content, comprehension, navigation, or decision making) are most/least helpful in choosing a nursing facility and whether any specific improvements can be made so that the report card information can help both minorities and non-minorities.

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Intensity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1996, average Medicare per capita expenditures were $3,700 in Minneapolis and $7,783 in Miami. Differences of a similar magnitude were observed across regions in patterns of end-of-life care, such as the chances of dying in a hospital or the number of different specialists seen in the last 6 months of life. Previous research indicates that these geographic variations in treatment are due largely to differences in intensity, i.e., differences in the way similar patients are treated. Improved understanding of the causes and consequences of regional variations in intensity could have important implications for the health and well-being of the elderly, for addressing health disparities and for the financial health of the Medicare trust funds. This project addresses these issues by: 1. Measuring how patients of similar illness levels are treated differently across regions with respect to both overall intensity and different dimensions of intensity. 2. Determining the causes of differences in intensity. To what extent are they due to patient preferences for care, physician beliefs, or other factors? Why is it the norm in some regions but not others for elderly patients to experience extensive diagnostic testing for CAD, with subsequent downstream procedures, specialist referrals, and hospitalization? 3. Studying the consequences of greater health care intensity. What is the impact of greater intensity of care on outcomes that include survival, health functioning, and well-being more generally? 4. Seeking to understand how health care intensity, either across regions or over time, affects disparities across socioeconomic groups in health care treatments and outcomes. The project will bring together a cross-disciplinary research team comprised of investigators from the DAWG; the PORT; the Maine Medical Center; the Center for Survey Research in Boston, MA; Massachusetts General Hospital; and the National Bureau of Economic Research.

"Hampton-Penn Center to Reduce Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to narrow the gap in health disparities that currently exist between American citizens of different ethnic and racial origins by capitalizing on and extending an existing partnership between the Hampton University School of Nursing and the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing. The proposed Hampton Penn Center for Reducing Health Disparities will 1) foster development of nursing partnerships between researchers, faculty, and students at Hampton University and the University of Pennsylvania and will further health disparity research at both institutions; 2) further the development and dissemination of culturally competent research and interventions related to health disparities among racial/ethnic minorities, marginalized and underserved populations, and 3) enhance the recruitment, retention and training of nurses into research careers who are themselves members of racial/ethnic minorities, marginalized and underserved populations who will be able to build the science that will reduce health disparities. Building on previous research in which culturally appropriate interventions have been designed to promote health and reduce risk of disease in minority populations, the Hampton Penn Center for Reducing Health Disparities (HPC) will focus on conducting culturally competent research on health promotion and disease prevention and the influence that culture, race and ethnicity exert within the client-system, healthcare-system, and the larger society that impact on health and illness. Specifically this center will enhance the conduct of research on health promotion and disease prevention within a cultural context and will: 1) Develop methodologies that are sensitive to answering research questions from diverse communities. 2) Increase the training of researchers from majority and minority institutions who conduct culturally competent research. 3) Foster research designed to reduce health disparities through a pilot funding mechanism. 4) Enhance the career development of minority health investigators (from undergraduates through faculty) who are conducting research designed to promote health and prevent disease through culturally competent research designs and interventions. The Hampton Penn Center for Reducing Health Disparities will meet these aims through: 1) an administrative core that will foster relationships between the two institutions and which will provide infrastructure support 2) a pilot core that will provide funding mechanisms to foster the conduct of research designed to reduce health disparities and 3) a mentorship core in which alliances between researchers at Hampton University and the University of Pennsylvania will be fostered.

"Literacy Development in English Language Learners DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research analyzes the development of reading skills in a sample of low SES, Latino, Spanish speaking English language learners. This population is at risk for low literacy attainment. A preliminary longitudinal study conducted in the same school district (1999 - 2002) found children with limited English proficiency (LEP) participating in a multisensory phonics-based early-exit bilingual program had mean reading scores in the average range on nationally normed reading tests in English through grade 2, but were below average on normed measures of English language skill. Funding is sought to follow these children (n=225) through grade 8. Funding is also sought for a new longitudinal study. Better outcomes might be attained in a phonics-based program that emphasizes oral language to a greater extent (dual language program). The proposed study will follow five groups of children, three LEP and two non-LEP groups. Group 1 (LEP) (n=200) will be in the same early transition bilingual program utilizing multisensory phonics, group 2 (n=200) will be in a dual language program utilizing similar teaching methods, and group 3 (n=200) will be in English immersion (by parental request). Group 4 (non-LEP) (n=100) will be in the dual language program and group 5 (non-LEP) (n=100) will be in regular English instruction. A predictive test battery in Spanish, with measures of oral language skill, phonological skill, nonverbal ability and initial literacy, will be given in Spring of kindergarten. Family demographics and literacy practices in the home will be assessed. Follow-up measures of oral language, phonological skill, word reading, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and academic content knowledge will be given in both English and Spanish at the end of each grade (1 through 4th). School achievement test data will also be collected. Non-random assignment precludes drawing causal inferences about relative instructional effectiveness, but the results will indicate the extent to which English language learners in the three models of instruction attain normative levels of oral language and literacy, and how they compare to local English-speaking children. Correlational data from grades K-4 will be used to determine the characteristics of children who fail to attain average levels of English literacy within and across the 5 groups under study (e.g., based on type of program, phonological skill and exposure to literacy practices in the home).

"Improving Health Care through HIT in Morgan County,IN DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Morgan Hospital and Medical Center (MHMC) proposes to become the first small independent hospital in Indiana to collaborate with the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) to electronically share clinical information with other hospitals and physicians/health providers in the county, region, and state.  MHMC proposes thereby to extend the benefits of a sophisticated, innovative urban system (in nearby Indianapolis/Marion County) to a small rural area (Morgan Country) where the substantial movement of patients within and across county line impeded optimal health care delivery.  IHIE will ""wire"" health care by creating a common, secure infrastructure that will enhance communication and information-sharing among providers.  While respecting patient privacy, it will also allow providers to have access for treatment purposes to patient information housed in participating hospitals through a broad clinical database managed by the Regenstrief Institute on the campus of the Indiana University School of Medicine.  IHIE is beginning with a clinical messaging system that will provide participating hospitals and physicians with a history of radiology reports, EKG reports, ADT face sheet information, transcription and lab results with software (Docs4Docs) developed by the Regenstrief Institute.  The project will be overseen by a steering committee that includes representatives from each project partner and the evaluation team.

"Regulatory Reforn and Angiography Disparties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Beginning in 1996, New Jersey embarked on hospital regulatory reforms that addressed, among other goals, the long-standing problem of racial and ethnic disparities in use of cardiac angiography (CA). These reforms led to a doubling in the number of hospitals performing CA as well as state-monitoring of minority outreach and access activities for CA services at each hospital. This proposal builds on AHRQ-funded pilot studies to examine the effectiveness of this innovative policy. Specific aims are to: (1) determine whether the disparity between black and white CA utilization declined following implementation of NJ policies intended to expand access for minority patients, (2) evaluate how local health system characteristics may influence CA disparities and the pathways through which the NJ policy may have reduced these disparities; and (3) identify promising strategies for reducing CA disparities. Hispanic-white CA disparities will also be investigated. Quantitative modeling and qualitative analyses will be blended to evaluate CA disparity trends from 1993-2003 in contrast to trends in a non-reform state. Primary outcome measures are the white-black difference in age-sex adjusted CA rates in small areas and the volume and share of CA utilization by black patients at NJ hospitals that provided CA throughout the study period. Regression methods will be used to adjust for market area demographics and other factors. Hypotheses about the effects of changes in CA capacity and hospital competition will be tested. CA facilities that demonstrate higher-than-expected levels of service to black patients, based on regression models, will be selected for intensive case studies along with a set of matched comparison facilities that are not high performing. The case studies will be focused on the market areas of the selected facilities, and will include documentary review and semi-structured interviews of officials from the selected CA facilities, referring hospitals, community health centers and other players in the case markets. Research findings will be translated to the practice and policy community in the form of ""best practices"" and through feedback of hospital-specific CA disparity performance measures.            ",Regulatory Reforn and Angiography Disparties,6924520,R01HS014191,"['cardiovascular imaging /visualization ', ' angiography ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' data collection ', ' interview ', ' mathematical model ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",AHRQ,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2005,231680,0.043825178310024214
"Center for Vulnerable Populations Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to enhance strengths of communities to eliminate health disparities faced by vulnerable populations (VPs), with a particular focus on ethnic/racial minorities and people living in poverty. The CVPR has facilitated sharing and expanding resources to improve the competence of investigators studying health problems of VPs, to support ongoing evolution of the knowledge base and methods of VP research, and to develop collaborative relations with community partners. Goals of the CVPR in the next five years are to: 1) continue expanding the scientific knowledge base of health-related problems of VPs to a) reduce/eliminate health disparities; b) facilitate health promotion; and c) improve outcomes of nursing practice; 2) translate the knowledge, skills, and experience acquired in participatory research (PR) methods and community partnerships by university and community investigators into practice/action to improve the health status of VPs and to develop science in this area; 3) expand capacity to measure, analyze and link biologic and behavioral markers in VPs research; and 4) disseminate research findings to inform community partners, and to influence nursing, health policy development, ethical decision- making processes, and future research. The infrastructure of the CVPR supports achievement of these goals through a variety of research and educational activities conducted by 4 cores - Administrative, Bio Laboratory, Participatory Research and Community Partnerships (PRCPC) and Research Support. Over the past four years the interdisciplinary team of CVPR investigators and affiliates have established several community partnerships and university collaborations and developed a unique scientific interface between behavioral and biologic researchers studying VPs. By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of VP research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center Investigators are effectively addressing important health and nursing issues. The community-based partnerships provide a solid foundation for further development of the CVPR as an epicenter for research and training in community-based PR to reduce health disparities. Current and planned CVPR research addresses elimination of health disparities in areas related to infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A/B/C, tuberculosis), chronic illness (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma) substance use, and environmental quality. Continuance of the CVPR will enable investigators to sustain and expand efforts to confront health disparities in Los Angeles and the nation, to address national health goals established by several governmental agencies, and to build community capacity.

"Racial Disparity in Access High Quality Cardiac Surgeons DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities in access to high quality cardiac surgeons among the elderly Racial disparities in access to health care services is a well documented, if poorly understood, persistent characteristic of the American health care system. Inadequate access to services by racial minorities, as it leads to poor health outcomes and poor health, has become an important part of our national health policy agenda. Racial minorities have been shown to be less likely to receive cardiac surgery. Even when they gain access to surgery, they are still disadvantaged because they access surgeons with higher risk-adjusted mortality rates (RAMR), compared to whites.      These issues are of particular importance to the elderly population, as heart disease is one of the major morbidities in this population, it is the leading cause of death and over 50% of CABG surgeries are performed on individuals aged 65 and older. The proposed study is designed to test specific hypotheses about the factors contributing to the observed disparities in access to high quality cardiac surgeons. It will test hypotheses related to three referral decisions foci: the patient, the referring physician and the managed care organization (MCO). The population studied will include all Medicare patients undergoing CABG surgery, all cardiac surgeons and hospitals in NYS. Medicare CABG patients will be surveyed about their use of RAMR information and their encounter with the referring physician. Medicare claims for medical care encounters prior to the surgery will be used to analyze referral patterns. NYS SPARCS data and MCO information, as well as a unique data set with information about contracting patterns of MCOs with hospitals and cardiac surgeons, will be used to study the effect of MCOs on racial disparities in access. Statistical multivariate regression techniques will be used to analyze the data. The knowledge gained in this project is essential for development of targeted programs that could successfully address the disparity in access to high quality cardiac care among elderly racial minorities.

"Virgin Islands Export Center for Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to develop the Caribbean Export Center for Research and Education in Health Disparities in the Virgin Islands of the United States. The proposed Center will develop resources and the infrastructure needed to expand research capacity in education and health that will support interdisciplinary projects to reduce disparities in health status for health disparity populations in the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John). The Center will be located at the University of the Virgin Islands within the Division of Nursing. The University of the Virgin Islands is the only HBCU outside the continental U.S. Its baccalaureate nursing program is the only program in the territories preparing health professionals. A very sparse literature suggests that residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands have significant rates of heart disease, diabetes, HIV infection, infant mortality and other health disparities. However, beyond sketchy prevalence data incorporated in national reports, few studies have described factors that might be associated with reported prevalence rates. The population of the U.S. Virgin Islands is highly diverse with African American, African Carribean and Hispanics comprising 80% of the population. Access to care, lack of health insurance, limited education and poverty may represent significant barriers to health promotion and prevention activities that could ultimately reduce health disparities within our islands. Yet we will need to increase the capacity of faculty and community representatives to conduct disparity research that includes focused studies that incorporate island history, context, culture, access and other factors contributing to these disparities within the islands. The leadership, capacity building and other developmental activities described in this application reflect the underlying commitment of the University and our collaborating partners to improve our ability to address health disparities in the U.S. Virgin Islands more effectively.

"Access to Care for Myocardial Infarction in Rural Areas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to decrease health care disparities for rural patients with cardiovascular disease. The objective of this proposal is to determine if changes in national guidelines for the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction (Ml) have correlated with changes in patterns of care for rural patients with Ml. To accomplish this objective, we will use a hospital discharge database from the years 2000 and 2004 to compare the proportion of rural patients with Ml that received care in referral hospitals offering cardiac revascularization procedures versus those that only received care in local hospitals not offering such services. We will determine if this proportion has changed over the period of time during which new national guidelines were released to recommend an early invasive treatment strategy for a larger group of patients. We will also determine if these outcomes vary with the distance between where a patient lives and the closest referral hospital. We will use a geographic information system (GIS) to perform these analyses. Our research will identify potential disparities in access to care for rural patients with Ml.

"Representational Post-MI Nursing Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): This R03 application seeks 2 years of support to undertake the methodological development and pilot implementation of a nursing intervention for persons recovering from myocardial infarction (MI). The intervention will target the modification of misconceptions in patients' common sense models - or cognitive representations - of MI and coronary heart disease (CHD), with the ultimate goal of facilitating healthy behaviors and improving quality of life. The nursing intervention will use semi-structured telephone scripts to reinforce patients' accurate beliefs about CHD, while creating conditions conducive to the modification of CHD-related misconceptions through the application of principles from the social psychological literature on persuasion. In addition, the intervention will be tailored to participants' CHD risk factors and their unique cognitive representations of MI. The development of such an intervention is important for 2 reasons. First, misconceptions about CHD are very common among patients recovering from MI and such misconceptions predict non-adherence to post-MI recommendations regarding diet, exercise, and smoking cessation. Second, CHD-related misconceptions are especially pronounced among post-MI women and may contribute to gender disparities in CHD outcomes. The proposed R03 project will address 3 specific aims: (1) development of the materials and procedures for the nursing intervention; (2) pilot testing the intervention in a sample of 24 post-MI patients using a single-factor between-subjects experimental design; and (3) evaluating the feasibility of testing the intervention on a larger scale. The pilot study will involve assessing representations of MI and CHD by telephone at 1-week post-hospital discharge. Participants in the treatment group will receive the telephone intervention at 2 weeks post-discharge, with those in the control group receiving standard care. Outcome data regarding health behaviors, symptoms, and quality of life will be collected after 8-weeks.

"Support for Low Income Breastfeeding: Cost and Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Healthy People 2010 included the goal of increasing breastfeeding duration to 7 months for 50% of all mothers.  Other professional and national health organizations and the Health and Human Services Blueprint for Action on Breastfeeding recommended that women breastfeed exclusively for six months.  Increasing breastfeeding among low-income women is a priority, as disparities exist.  Only 20.1% of low-income women (on WIC) breastfeed for six months compared to 40.7% of more affluent women.  Consistent, comprehensive, culturally sensitive breastfeeding support increases duration of breastfeeding; thus offering well-documented health benefits often specifically appropriate for low-income women.  Breastfeeding relates to lower formula cost, lower health care costs, and breastfeeding may be less time consuming.  These cost savings can potentially offset costs of breastfeeding promotion.  Facilitating breastfeeding among low-income women includes comprehensive and culturally relevant support in the hospital, during the first week postpartum, and periodic support in the mother's home.  Nearly 35% of low-income women stop breastfeeding within eight days of delivery.  Repeated contact with supportive persons such as peer counselors and nurses, affects the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding practice after the immediate postpartum period.  However, support for low-income women has been neglected and not made available because of generally unsubstantiated claims that it is not cost effective.  For this project the broad long-term objective is to determine the net cost savings of improved breastfeeding outcomes resulting from a community health nurse/peer counselor breastfeeding intervention.  The breastfeeding intervention will use an enhanced traditional community health nurse/peer counselor home visit, which is no longer usual care for contemporary community health nursing practice, along with community health nurse (CHN)/peer counselor in-hospital and telephone support.  The overall hypothesis is the intervention group will have improved breastfeeding outcomes and will demonstrate a net cost savings over usual care.

"Center for Vulnerable Populations Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to enhance strengths of communities to eliminate health disparities faced by vulnerable populations (VPs), with a particular focus on ethnic/racial minorities and people living in poverty. The CVPR has facilitated sharing and expanding resources to improve the competence of investigators studying health problems of VPs, to support ongoing evolution of the knowledge base and methods of VP research, and to develop collaborative relations with community partners. Goals of the CVPR in the next five years are to: 1) continue expanding the scientific knowledge base of health-related problems of VPs to a) reduce/eliminate health disparities; b) facilitate health promotion; and c) improve outcomes of nursing practice; 2) translate the knowledge, skills, and experience acquired in participatory research (PR) methods and community partnerships by university and community investigators into practice/action to improve the health status of VPs and to develop science in this area; 3) expand capacity to measure, analyze and link biologic and behavioral markers in VPs research; and 4) disseminate research findings to inform community partners, and to influence nursing, health policy development, ethical decision- making processes, and future research. The infrastructure of the CVPR supports achievement of these goals through a variety of research and educational activities conducted by 4 cores - Administrative, Bio Laboratory, Participatory Research and Community Partnerships (PRCPC) and Research Support. Over the past four years the interdisciplinary team of CVPR investigators and affiliates have established several community partnerships and university collaborations and developed a unique scientific interface between behavioral and biologic researchers studying VPs. By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of VP research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center Investigators are effectively addressing important health and nursing issues. The community-based partnerships provide a solid foundation for further development of the CVPR as an epicenter for research and training in community-based PR to reduce health disparities. Current and planned CVPR research addresses elimination of health disparities in areas related to infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A/B/C, tuberculosis), chronic illness (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma) substance use, and environmental quality. Continuance of the CVPR will enable investigators to sustain and expand efforts to confront health disparities in Los Angeles and the nation, to address national health goals established by several governmental agencies, and to build community capacity.

"Hampton Penn Center To Reduce Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to narrow the gap in health disparities that currently exist between American citizens of different ethnic and racial origins by capitalizing on and extending an existing partnership between the Hampton University School of Nursing and the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing. The proposed Hampton Penn Center for Reducing Health Disparities will 1) foster development of nursing partnerships between researchers, faculty, and students at Hampton University and the University of Pennsylvania and will further health disparity research at both institutions; 2) further the development and dissemination of culturally competent research and interventions related to health disparities among racial/ethnic minorities, marginalized and underserved populations, and 3) enhance the recruitment, retention and training of nurses into research careers who are themselves members of racial/ethnic minorities, marginalized and underserved populations who will be able to build the science that will reduce health disparities. Building on previous research in which culturally appropriate interventions have been designed to promote health and reduce risk of disease in minority populations, the Hampton Penn Center for Reducing Health Disparities (HPC) will focus on conducting culturally competent research on health promotion and disease prevention and the influence that culture, race and ethnicity exert within the client-system, healthcare-system, and the larger society that impact on health and illness. Specifically this center will enhance the conduct of research on health promotion and disease prevention within a cultural context and will: 1) Develop methodologies that are sensitive to answering research questions from diverse communities. 2) Increase the training of researchers from majority and minority institutions who conduct culturally competent research. 3) Foster research designed to reduce health disparities through a pilot funding mechanism. 4) Enhance the career development of minority health investigators (from undergraduates through faculty) who are conducting research designed to promote health and prevent disease through culturally competent research designs and interventions. The Hampton Penn Center for Reducing Health Disparities will meet these aims through: 1) an administrative core that will foster relationships between the two institutions and which will provide infrastructure support 2) a pilot core that will provide funding mechanisms to foster the conduct of research designed to reduce health disparities and 3) a mentorship core in which alliances between researchers at Hampton University and the University of Pennsylvania will be fostered.

"Family-Nurse Care Coordination Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) represent 12.8% of children nationally (9.3 million) and 13.1% of children in Florida. These children need and use more services from health, developmental, educational, and related systems. Disparities in access to care exist for some children (low income, minority, no insurance) and the financial impact (bills, time, lost employment) on families can be great. Families may not be aware of the resources available to them. Families also express frustration with finding and getting information and services. Care coordination is reported to improve access to services, satisfaction with care, and reduce costs. Yet, care coordination is not well described and effects on the family are unknown. Families don't always understand the services available to them, express dissatisfaction, or arrange services themselves. The purpose of this R21 mixed-method exploratory study is to develop and test a family-nurse care coordination intervention for families of CSHCN and their Title V nurse care coordinators. Our study is relevant to the NIH mission to develop effective interventions, improve access and quality of care, and reduce disparities. Aim 1 will explore family experience, knowledge, and satisfaction with coordination through telephone interviews of a random sample of 500 families. Qualitative interviews with a subsample (n=40) of families will explore strategies families use, barriers they face, and begin to elicit how having care coordination helps families. Nurse focus groups will identify factors that facilitate and challenge their work with families, understand what they do, and what they need. Aim 2 will use a community-based participatory approach, (parents, providers, nurses, researchers) to develop the intervention emphasizing a family-nurse partnership. We will do this through guided co-learning, search for existing materials, discussion, and will incorporate our preliminary research results from the survey and interviews into intervention development. We anticipate a curriculum related to navigating systems of care that incorporates a Care Notebook (child's health record). We will train peer-parents with the nurses in the identified intervnetion. Our CPBR team will also reflect and evaluate they way they worked together. Aim 3 will test the feasibility of a peer-parent outreach visit to 200 family participants to teach the curriculum and identify unmet needs. Pre-visit and post- visit briefings will take place between peer-parent and nurse. Families will also be offered an opportunity to review their child's Title V medical record. The qualitative family participant subsample will be re-interviewed to explore perceptions of the intervention and family-sensitive outcome measures. Our study has implications for how systems of coordination can be enhanced. It also has implications for the teaching and support of the families who do not qualify for coordination servcies and do it themselves. Families and nurses have much to teach each other, and other families, about how to achieve the best care for children.           ",Family-Nurse Care Coordination Partnership,7069429,R21NR009781,"['family ', ' nursing care ', ' clinical research ', ' children ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH FLORIDA,R21,2006,161106,0.022441396110415467

"Improving Health Care through HIT in Morgan County,IN DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Morgan Hospital and Medical Center (MHMC) proposes to become the first small independent hospital in Indiana to collaborate with the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) to electronically share clinical information with other hospitals and physicians/health providers in the county, region, and state.  MHMC proposes thereby to extend the benefits of a sophisticated, innovative urban system (in nearby Indianapolis/Marion County) to a small rural area (Morgan Country) where the substantial movement of patients within and across county line impeded optimal health care delivery.  IHIE will ""wire"" health care by creating a common, secure infrastructure that will enhance communication and information-sharing among providers.  While respecting patient privacy, it will also allow providers to have access for treatment purposes to patient information housed in participating hospitals through a broad clinical database managed by the Regenstrief Institute on the campus of the Indiana University School of Medicine.  IHIE is beginning with a clinical messaging system that will provide participating hospitals and physicians with a history of radiology reports, EKG reports, ADT face sheet information, transcription and lab results with software (Docs4Docs) developed by the Regenstrief Institute.  The project will be overseen by a steering committee that includes representatives from each project partner and the evaluation team.

"The significance of racial segregation for CV disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segregation has been widely studied as a cause of educational and socioeconomic inequities in American society. However, few studies have sought to quantify the degree of segregation that exists within individual health care markets, and virtually no studies have examined the impact of segregation on racial disparities in health care. This study will examine the link between segregation in health care markets and disparities in health care delivery for black and white patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a condition for which there exists substantial evidence of racial disparities. The specific aims are to: 1. Determine relationships between segregation and racial disparities in the use of coronary revascularization after acute myocardial infarction. 2. Determine relationships between segregation and racial disparities in mortality and readmission for acute coronary syndrome in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 3. Determine relationships between segregation and racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals. The 24-month study will analyze existing data for Medicare patients admitted for AMI to non-federal hospitals during a 10-year period from 1993 through 2002. The study will measure segregation in health care markets using two validated methods that have been widely used in sociology and will evaluate relationships between the segregation measures and racial disparities in the endpoints described above. Additional analyses will examine changes in segregation over time within individual markets and relationships between segregation and other health care market characteristics. The knowledge gained from this study about the significance of segregation as a determinant of racial disparity will be essential for designing effective strategies for eliminating disparities.             ",The significance of racial segregation for CV disease,7015730,R03AG027286,"['human old age (65+) ', ' relapse /recurrence ', ' acute disease /disorder ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service availability ', ' myocardial infarction ', ' heart revascularization ', ' hospital utilization ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' social integration ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R03,2006,66375,0.012758921622495527
"Phenotype Assessment Tools:Bilingual(Spanish-English)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The bilingual population in the United States is one of the fastest growing school-age populations. Yet there are few diagnostic instruments that accurately distinguish between bilingual children with and without language impairment (LI). Development between 7 and 9 years of age is of interest because this is the age at which children who are acquiring a second language are more likely to be identified with LI (as compared to a younger age). While many of the children in this broad population typically have already had exposure to English, most are still within the 5 to 7 year time frame they need to acquire academic language. This makes identification of LI particularly challenging. Scientific knowledge about LI in bilingual children has improved over the last 10 years, but such knowledge has not been systematically translated into assessment instruments. Thus, an innovative aspect of this application is that we extend a recently developed protocol to an age group where there is a critical need for such instruments. In response to RFA-DC-05-001, Typical/Disordered Language: Phenotype Assessment Tools we have planned a two phase study to develop an upward extension of the Bilingual English Spanish Assessment (BESA; a NIDCD supported instrument) for children aged 7 to 9 years. In Phase I we develop an item set and test it on 136 Spanish English bilinguals with and without LI (focusing on 8 year olds). We then submit these items to analyses and reduce the item set to those which have the greatest potential to discriminate between children with and without LI. In Phase 2, the reduced item set will be tested on 134 bilinguals with and without LI (extending to 7 and 9 year olds). These items sets will be used to generate interrelated psychometric parallel versions of the BESA (for identification purposes) and linguistic parallel versions of the BESA (for research purposes). These steps will provide the information needed to conduct longitudinal studies of bilingual language development and disorders. These will be addressed in future applications. Language impairment is a developmental disability that interferes with education and other life functions of individuals. There are disparities in the identification of language impairment in minority populations such as Latino children who speak English and Spanish. This application addresses this concern by working to develop an assessment protocol to improve identification of bilingual children with language impairment.         ",Phenotype Assessment Tools:Bilingual(Spanish-English),7029921,R21HD053223,"['middle childhood (6-11) ', ' diagnosis design /evaluation ', ' elementary school ', ' human subject ', ' vocabulary ', ' language development ', ' multilingualism ', ' language disorder ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' communication disorder diagnosis ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2006,150000,0.032041334353118865

"Nursing Homes: Measuring Care Orientation and Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed study will explore the effect of nursing home spending patterns on quality of care, staff mix and staff turnover by using financial ratio analysis methods. Analysis of financial ratios is one of the most effective and widely used methods of evaluating management behavior and strategic orientation. Financial ratio analysis has been traditionally used by creditors, stockholders, and top-level management decision makers in order to predict future conditions of a firm and to make plans that will influence the future course of events, including quality improvements. Studies on nursing home quality have only examined the effects of broad organizational factors such as profit status, profit margin, and total resident care cost on a number of quality indicators. The applicant proposes an analytical approach that will identify and examine specific financial ratios that help produce higher levels of quality by disaggregating total spending into a number of cost centers and activities. This new approach will clarify the effect of a facility's allocation of spending among different cost categories on a variety of quality indicators. Data sources include the Texas Medicaid Cost Report Data, a multidimensional set of quality indicators from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Online Survey Certification Automated Reporting (OSCAR) data sets, and market variables from the Area Resource File (ARF). These data will be used to develop a set of structure, process and outcome quality measures, including staff mix and staff turnover. The analysis will focus on the effect of financial ratios, controlling for market factors, on quality. In addition to the individual financial ratios, the applicant will evaluate the utility of a financial ratio scale as a predictor of quality. Furthermore, this study will explore racial and socioeconomic disparities in nursing homes. In order to improve nursing home quality, regulatory and payment policy must establish an incentive structure for practices that result in changes in the way the majority of facilities currently perform. Results from this study could identify limits on administrative costs or minimum direct resident care spending levels that suggest a more effective reimbursement structure. Such spending guidelines and changes in payment policy, combined with incentives for better staff mix and retention, might be more effective policy tools affecting nursing home management decisions than the poorly enforced federal minimum quality standards.          ",Nursing Homes: Measuring Care Orientation and Quality,7088653,R36HS016229,"['health care facility ', ' nursing home ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' health care personnel ', ' model design /development ', ' health care model ', ' decision making ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",AHRQ,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR,R36,2006,29996,0.04632090444318833
"MINORITY PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal attempts to answer the following questions: 1) Can a measure of language fluency/discordance be developed to capture communication behaviors used by foreign-born IMG physicians that are predictive of patient outcomes? 2) Are there differences in the communication behaviors of foreign-born IMG physicians and USMG physicians with ethnic minority, low income, and Medicaid versus white, higher income, and privately insured patients? 3) Does language fluency discordance (defined by primary language spoken at home and/or a new measure) between physicians and patients explain racial and ethnic disparities in patient ratings of care and health status? Research methods focus on secondary data analysis of 1) audiotapes of primary care medical visits and 2) data from patient and physician questionnaires collected proximal to time of audio taping visits.

"Virgin Islands Export Center for Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to develop the Caribbean Export Center for Research and Education in Health Disparities in the Virgin Islands of the United States. The proposed Center will develop resources and the infrastructure needed to expand research capacity in education and health that will support interdisciplinary projects to reduce disparities in health status for health disparity populations in the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John). The Center will be located at the University of the Virgin Islands within the Division of Nursing. The University of the Virgin Islands is the only HBCU outside the continental U.S. Its baccalaureate nursing program is the only program in the territories preparing health professionals. A very sparse literature suggests that residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands have significant rates of heart disease, diabetes, HIV infection, infant mortality and other health disparities. However, beyond sketchy prevalence data incorporated in national reports, few studies have described factors that might be associated with reported prevalence rates. The population of the U.S. Virgin Islands is highly diverse with African American, African Carribean and Hispanics comprising 80% of the population. Access to care, lack of health insurance, limited education and poverty may represent significant barriers to health promotion and prevention activities that could ultimately reduce health disparities within our islands. Yet we will need to increase the capacity of faculty and community representatives to conduct disparity research that includes focused studies that incorporate island history, context, culture, access and other factors contributing to these disparities within the islands. The leadership, capacity building and other developmental activities described in this application reflect the underlying commitment of the University and our collaborating partners to improve our ability to address health disparities in the U.S. Virgin Islands more effectively.

"Center for Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Nursing Partnership Center for the Advancement of Health Disparities Research is to participate in and provide leadership to research-based innovations that will reduce health disparities among and within population groups. The Center will focus particular but not exclusive attention on health disparities affecting the Asian and Pacific Islander population. The mission of the Center is threefold. The Center will develop a collaborative relationship between the University of Washington and The University of Hawaii Schools of Nursing that will foster sustainable mechanisms for scholarship development in health disparities. The Center will mentor nurse researchers through learning institutes, guided research studies, and dissemination of new knowledge. These mentored nurse researchers will begin the development of a knowledge base for innovation in health disparities research. The mission of the Center will be guided by a conceptual framework that makes explicit the variables of interest that influence health disparities and the mechanism the Center will use to impact the ultimate outcome of reducing health disparities. The Center will act as a catalyst for research on the variables affecting health disparities. The mechanism includes the recruitment, selection and mentoring of faculty using the expert knowledge of the Advisory Committee and senior faculty of both institutions. The Center will knit together a set of pilot studies each year of the grant that advance the knowledge about health disparities and knowledge about best practices to eliminate health disparities. The Center will channel the knowledge discovered via its mentoring and dissemination core.  The variables of interest for the Center are clustered into five dimensions: Determinants of Health; Effects on Population Health Resulting from Health Disparities; Health Care Needs Resulting from Health Disparities; Policy and System Supports for the Elimination of Health Disparities; and Health Status Data, Trends in Disparities, and Best Approaches.

"Support for Low Income Breastfeeding: Cost and Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Healthy People 2010 included the goal of increasing breastfeeding duration to 7 months for 50% of all mothers.  Other professional and national health organizations and the Health and Human Services Blueprint for Action on Breastfeeding recommended that women breastfeed exclusively for six months.  Increasing breastfeeding among low-income women is a priority, as disparities exist.  Only 20.1% of low-income women (on WIC) breastfeed for six months compared to 40.7% of more affluent women.  Consistent, comprehensive, culturally sensitive breastfeeding support increases duration of breastfeeding; thus offering well-documented health benefits often specifically appropriate for low-income women.  Breastfeeding relates to lower formula cost, lower health care costs, and breastfeeding may be less time consuming.  These cost savings can potentially offset costs of breastfeeding promotion.  Facilitating breastfeeding among low-income women includes comprehensive and culturally relevant support in the hospital, during the first week postpartum, and periodic support in the mother's home.  Nearly 35% of low-income women stop breastfeeding within eight days of delivery.  Repeated contact with supportive persons such as peer counselors and nurses, affects the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding practice after the immediate postpartum period.  However, support for low-income women has been neglected and not made available because of generally unsubstantiated claims that it is not cost effective.  For this project the broad long-term objective is to determine the net cost savings of improved breastfeeding outcomes resulting from a community health nurse/peer counselor breastfeeding intervention.  The breastfeeding intervention will use an enhanced traditional community health nurse/peer counselor home visit, which is no longer usual care for contemporary community health nursing practice, along with community health nurse (CHN)/peer counselor in-hospital and telephone support.  The overall hypothesis is the intervention group will have improved breastfeeding outcomes and will demonstrate a net cost savings over usual care.

"Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is submitted in response to RFA NR -02 0004, Nursing Partnership Centers on Health Disparities Grants. Yale School of Nursing (YSN) and the Howard University Division of Nursing (HUDON) propose to develop a Partnership Center on Reducing Health Disparities by Self and Family Management. Self-management encompasses a broad range of health, lifestyle, behavioral and self-assessment and treatment activities practiced by an individual in the context of the family, often with the support of nurses. Self and family management activities vary across socioeconomic status, gender and ethnic/cultural background. Within certain groups, disparities exist in risk to health status, access to health care and in treatment outcomes. We believe that self-management represents one promising avenue for eliminating these disparities. With better understanding of self-management approaches in populations experiencing health disparities, nursing interventions can be developed to support self-management and eliminate health disparities. The Center builds on an existing partnership between YSN and HUDON: the federally funded Yale-Howard Scholars Program. The scientific focus of the Partnership Center extends the work of YSN's funded Exploratory Center on Self-Management Interventions for Populations at Risk into the area of disparities. The Partnership Center will build capacity by recruiting and developing nurse scientists to conduct culturally relevant and competent research to eliminate health disparities. The Center will be under the direction of Drs. Catherine Gilliss (YSN) & Dorothy Powell (HUDON), and will include: Administrative Core (Gilliss/Powell; Drs. Grey [YSN] & Nichols [HUDON]); Pilot/Feasibility Core (Drs. Williams YSN] & Austin [Howard University]; Research Mentoring Core (Drs. Funk [YSN] & Ruff [HUDON]; and Research/Outreach Dissemination Core (Drs. McCorkle [YSN] & Jordan [HUDON]). Proposals for four pilot studies are included with this application.

"Literacy Development in English Language Learners DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research analyzes the development of reading skills in a sample of low SES, Latino, Spanish speaking English language learners. This population is at risk for low literacy attainment. A preliminary longitudinal study conducted in the same school district (1999 - 2002) found children with limited English proficiency (LEP) participating in a multisensory phonics-based early-exit bilingual program had mean reading scores in the average range on nationally normed reading tests in English through grade 2, but were below average on normed measures of English language skill. Funding is sought to follow these children (n=225) through grade 8. Funding is also sought for a new longitudinal study. Better outcomes might be attained in a phonics-based program that emphasizes oral language to a greater extent (dual language program). The proposed study will follow five groups of children, three LEP and two non-LEP groups. Group 1 (LEP) (n=200) will be in the same early transition bilingual program utilizing multisensory phonics, group 2 (n=200) will be in a dual language program utilizing similar teaching methods, and group 3 (n=200) will be in English immersion (by parental request). Group 4 (non-LEP) (n=100) will be in the dual language program and group 5 (non-LEP) (n=100) will be in regular English instruction. A predictive test battery in Spanish, with measures of oral language skill, phonological skill, nonverbal ability and initial literacy, will be given in Spring of kindergarten. Family demographics and literacy practices in the home will be assessed. Follow-up measures of oral language, phonological skill, word reading, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and academic content knowledge will be given in both English and Spanish at the end of each grade (1 through 4th). School achievement test data will also be collected. Non-random assignment precludes drawing causal inferences about relative instructional effectiveness, but the results will indicate the extent to which English language learners in the three models of instruction attain normative levels of oral language and literacy, and how they compare to local English-speaking children. Correlational data from grades K-4 will be used to determine the characteristics of children who fail to attain average levels of English literacy within and across the 5 groups under study (e.g., based on type of program, phonological skill and exposure to literacy practices in the home).

"Regulatory Reforn and Angiography Disparties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Beginning in 1996, New Jersey embarked on hospital regulatory reforms that addressed, among other goals, the long-standing problem of racial and ethnic disparities in use of cardiac angiography (CA). These reforms led to a doubling in the number of hospitals performing CA as well as state-monitoring of minority outreach and access activities for CA services at each hospital. This proposal builds on AHRQ-funded pilot studies to examine the effectiveness of this innovative policy. Specific aims are to: (1) determine whether the disparity between black and white CA utilization declined following implementation of NJ policies intended to expand access for minority patients, (2) evaluate how local health system characteristics may influence CA disparities and the pathways through which the NJ policy may have reduced these disparities; and (3) identify promising strategies for reducing CA disparities. Hispanic-white CA disparities will also be investigated. Quantitative modeling and qualitative analyses will be blended to evaluate CA disparity trends from 1993-2003 in contrast to trends in a non-reform state. Primary outcome measures are the white-black difference in age-sex adjusted CA rates in small areas and the volume and share of CA utilization by black patients at NJ hospitals that provided CA throughout the study period. Regression methods will be used to adjust for market area demographics and other factors. Hypotheses about the effects of changes in CA capacity and hospital competition will be tested. CA facilities that demonstrate higher-than-expected levels of service to black patients, based on regression models, will be selected for intensive case studies along with a set of matched comparison facilities that are not high performing. The case studies will be focused on the market areas of the selected facilities, and will include documentary review and semi-structured interviews of officials from the selected CA facilities, referring hospitals, community health centers and other players in the case markets. Research findings will be translated to the practice and policy community in the form of ""best practices"" and through feedback of hospital-specific CA disparity performance measures.            ",Regulatory Reforn and Angiography Disparties,7113197,R01HS014191,"['cardiovascular imaging /visualization ', ' angiography ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' data collection ', ' interview ', ' mathematical model ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",AHRQ,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2006,307108,0.043825178310024214
"Educational Television Program for Children of Immigrant Households    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract: The language barrier between immigrant parents and their English-dominant children is a daily and relatively unnoticed problem in 12 million U.S. households. The intergenerational language gap often leads to adverse health outcomes for both children and adults: (1) it hinders young children's ability to communicate with their parents when they feel sick; and (2) as children are inevitably relied upon as interpreters for family members during office visits and medical emergencies, they are ill-prepared both linguistically and mentally for the difficult task. This proposal seeks to develop a television program that can bridge the intergenerational language gap and improve the health status of all members of an immigrant household. During Phase I, treatments (blueprint) for a 10-episode television series will be created for Mandarin-speaking Chinese viewers, with 1 particular treatment fully developed into an animated pilot episode. A sample population of 60 participants, including children, parents, educators and health providers will view the pilot episode and assess its effectiveness using a variety of test instruments. Their feedback will be used to determine the project's feasibility. Project Narrative: This proposed project will develop an innovative television program that combines language and healthcare education and can be enjoyed by both children and parents together.

"Deaf People and Healthcare    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Steven Barnett MD is a family physician whose career has focused on healthcare with deaf people and families who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf people who communicate in ASL are a medically underserved and understudied vulnerable minority with much in common with other linguistic and socio cultural minority groups. Dr. Barnett's career goal is to be a leading expert and independent researcher on the topic of health and healthcare with deaf people and their families. The University of Rochester is an ideal place to work toward that goal, since Rochester has a large deaf population and the University of Rochester Medical Center is motivated to become a center of excellence on health promotion and disease prevention with people who are deaf. In order to achieve his goal, Dr. Barnett will pursue more advanced research training, including formal coursework in survey methods, epidemiology and sampling methods. He will also work with mentors, consultant and advisors to create individualized curricula focused on skills development in mixed quantitative and qualitative research methods, advanced ASL, and psychometrics, including issues related to translation and adaptation of English language tools for use with non-English populations. Dr. Barnett will work with his mentors, consultant and community advisory board to conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the healthcare experiences of deaf adult ASL-users. They will do this by translating and adapting the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) ambulatory care survey in order to collect information in ASL from deaf people about their healthcare experiences. They will administer CAHPS-ASL to four groups of deaf adult ASL-users in Rochester to learn about healthcare experiences in different settings. Dr. Barnett will bring the data and analyses back to his community advisory board and they will work together to plan future research and interventions to address the health and healthcare disparities experienced by deaf people and their families. CAHPS-ASL will be the first national survey adapted to learn about healthcare experiences from deaf adult ASL-users in their own language.

"Technological Home Care: Improving Caregiving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific aims of this study are to test the effects of a nursing intervention (FamTechCare) on family caregivers' problem solving ability, participation in health care management, health status, depression, quality of life, and health care services costs. Subjects in the study will be family caregivers (n= 80) and 80 adult patients dependent for survival on Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) infusions due to nonmalignant gastrointestinal disorders. Recruitment is through Kansas University Hospital and its rural outreach centers. Enrollment will be staggered over the project in order to assure adequate numbers and representative gender and racial distributions. Research methods include a placebo-controlled longitudinal clinical trial design with crossover and interventions delivered by videophone nurse visits, internet-based home care algorithm guides and by peer support. Peers are family caregivers with extensive HPN experience who will be trained to mentor dyads via videophone. These FamTechCare interventions are based on extensive preliminary data and include new, innovative extensions for this study. The entire intervention was pilot- tested and found feasible and not a burden. Questionnaires and laboratory data used to obtain pre- and post-intervention data are valid, sensitive to change and reliable and were completed in an average 20 minutes during pilot testing. Data analyses will include nested linear mixed model hypothesis testing to detect effects on caregiver/patient dyads. The novel concept of nurse caring conveyed via internet is also tested.

"MINORITY PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal attempts to answer the following questions: 1) Can a measure of language fluency/discordance be developed to capture communication behaviors used by foreign-born IMG physicians that are predictive of patient outcomes? 2) Are there differences in the communication behaviors of foreign-born IMG physicians and USMG physicians with ethnic minority, low income, and Medicaid versus white, higher income, and privately insured patients? 3) Does language fluency discordance (defined by primary language spoken at home and/or a new measure) between physicians and patients explain racial and ethnic disparities in patient ratings of care and health status? Research methods focus on secondary data analysis of 1) audiotapes of primary care medical visits and 2) data from patient and physician questionnaires collected proximal to time of audio taping visits. Information gained from this work may help to inform the development of medical education and health care system interventions targeting physicians who are foreign-born and international medical graduates and the patient populations they serve, to improve quality of care and health outcomes for minority and low SES patients.            ",MINORITY PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM,7159404,F31HL079894,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Low income ', ' Medical Education ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foreign Medical Graduates ', ' Affect ', ' communication behavior ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Medical ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Medicaid ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Class ', ' Time ', ' Audiotape ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2007,43535,0.002706715674027776

"Deaf People and Healthcare    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Steven Barnett MD is a family physician whose career has focused on healthcare with deaf people and families who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf people who communicate in ASL are a medically underserved and understudied vulnerable minority with much in common with other linguistic and socio cultural minority groups. Dr. Barnett's career goal is to be a leading expert and independent researcher on the topic of health and healthcare with deaf people and their families. The University of Rochester is an ideal place to work toward that goal, since Rochester has a large deaf population and the University of Rochester Medical Center is motivated to become a center of excellence on health promotion and disease prevention with people who are deaf. In order to achieve his goal, Dr. Barnett will pursue more advanced research training, including formal coursework in survey methods, epidemiology and sampling methods. He will also work with mentors, consultant and advisors to create individualized curricula focused on skills development in mixed quantitative and qualitative research methods, advanced ASL, and psychometrics, including issues related to translation and adaptation of English language tools for use with non-English populations. Dr. Barnett will work with his mentors, consultant and community advisory board to conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the healthcare experiences of deaf adult ASL-users. They will do this by translating and adapting the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) ambulatory care survey in order to collect information in ASL from deaf people about their healthcare experiences. They will administer CAHPS-ASL to four groups of deaf adult ASL-users in Rochester to learn about healthcare experiences in different settings. Dr. Barnett will bring the data and analyses back to his community advisory board and they will work together to plan future research and interventions to address the health and healthcare disparities experienced by deaf people and their families. CAHPS-ASL will be the first national survey adapted to learn about healthcare experiences from deaf adult ASL-users in their own language. Creating accessible research and addressing disparities are goals consistent with Healthy People 2010 objectives and essential to improve the quality and effectiveness of healthcare for this vulnerable population.           ",Deaf People and Healthcare,7290936,K08HS015700,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K08,2007,127058,0.029169048343253845
"Center for Vulnerable Populations Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to enhance strengths of communities to eliminate health disparities faced by vulnerable populations (VPs), with a particular focus on ethnic/racial minorities and people living in poverty. The CVPR has facilitated sharing and expanding resources to improve the competence of investigators studying health problems of VPs, to support ongoing evolution of the knowledge base and methods of VP research, and to develop collaborative relations with community partners. Goals of the CVPR in the next five years are to: 1) continue expanding the scientific knowledge base of health-related problems of VPs to a) reduce/eliminate health disparities; b) facilitate health promotion; and c) improve outcomes of nursing practice; 2) translate the knowledge, skills, and experience acquired in participatory research (PR) methods and community partnerships by university and community investigators into practice/action to improve the health status of VPs and to develop science in this area; 3) expand capacity to measure, analyze and link biologic and behavioral markers in VPs research; and 4) disseminate research findings to inform community partners, and to influence nursing, health policy development, ethical decision- making processes, and future research. The infrastructure of the CVPR supports achievement of these goals through a variety of research and educational activities conducted by 4 cores - Administrative, Bio Laboratory, Participatory Research and Community Partnerships (PRCPC) and Research Support. Over the past four years the interdisciplinary team of CVPR investigators and affiliates have established several community partnerships and university collaborations and developed a unique scientific interface between behavioral and biologic researchers studying VPs. By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of VP research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center Investigators are effectively addressing important health and nursing issues. The community-based partnerships provide a solid foundation for further development of the CVPR as an epicenter for research and training in community-based PR to reduce health disparities. Current and planned CVPR research addresses elimination of health disparities in areas related to infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A/B/C, tuberculosis), chronic illness (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma) substance use, and environmental quality. Continuance of the CVPR will enable investigators to sustain and expand efforts to confront health disparities in Los Angeles and the nation, to address national health goals established by several governmental agencies, and to build community capacity.

"Phenotype Assessment Tools:Bilingual(Spanish-English)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The bilingual population in the United States is one of the fastest growing school-age populations. Yet there are few diagnostic instruments that accurately distinguish between bilingual children with and without language impairment (LI). Development between 7 and 9 years of age is of interest because this is the age at which children who are acquiring a second language are more likely to be identified with LI (as compared to a younger age). While many of the children in this broad population typically have already had exposure to English, most are still within the 5 to 7 year time frame they need to acquire academic language. This makes identification of LI particularly challenging. Scientific knowledge about LI in bilingual children has improved over the last 10 years, but such knowledge has not been systematically translated into assessment instruments. Thus, an innovative aspect of this application is that we extend a recently developed protocol to an age group where there is a critical need for such instruments. In response to RFA-DC-05-001, Typical/Disordered Language: Phenotype Assessment Tools we have planned a two phase study to develop an upward extension of the Bilingual English Spanish Assessment (BESA; a NIDCD supported instrument) for children aged 7 to 9 years. In Phase I we develop an item set and test it on 136 Spanish English bilinguals with and without LI (focusing on 8 year olds). We then submit these items to analyses and reduce the item set to those which have the greatest potential to discriminate between children with and without LI. In Phase 2, the reduced item set will be tested on 134 bilinguals with and without LI (extending to 7 and 9 year olds). These items sets will be used to generate interrelated psychometric parallel versions of the BESA (for identification purposes) and linguistic parallel versions of the BESA (for research purposes). These steps will provide the information needed to conduct longitudinal studies of bilingual language development and disorders. These will be addressed in future applications. Language impairment is a developmental disability that interferes with education and other life functions of individuals.

"Regionalization of elective total joint replacement    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     There is a strong relationship between hospital and surgeon volume and outcomes of total joint replacement. Therefore, regionalization, the movement of cases from low volume hospitals to high volume hospitals, of elective total joint replacements may be beneficial. The possible benefits of regionalization include improved patient outcomes and lower health care costs through a decreased rate of complications and revision surgery. However, the benefits of regionalization may not be equitably distributed if traditionally underserved patients face barriers to seeking regionalized care. Differential access to regionalized surgical care could possibly widen health disparities that already exist.      The aims of this research are: 1) to describe the frequency and predictors of regionalization of elective total joint replacement in the US; and 2) to assess whether regionalization for elective total joint replacement is associated with improved short-term patient outcomes. These aims will be accomplished by identifying the percentage of patients undergoing total joint replacements who traveled beyond their hospital service area (HSA) to undergo total joint replacement at a higher volume hospital in another HSA. Those who receive care in their local HSA will be considered ""localized"" while those who receive care elsewhere will be considered ""regionalized.""      Patients will be identified through existing hospital discharge databases for 21 states throughout the US. The effects of patient, age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status and comorbidity on the likelihood of receiving regionalized care will be evaluated using multivariable repeated measures models including methods that account for the correlation of procedures performed by the same surgeon or within the same hospital. To determine whether regionalization improves short-term outcomes, rates of surgical complication and revision procedures will be compared between patients who regionalize and those who do not, adjusting for potential confounders.      The results of this research will provide important insights regarding predictors and outcomes of regionalized orthopedic care. If regionalization is associated with reduced rates of surgical complications and revision procedures, and if regionalization is less common among traditionally underserved populations, then interventions to increase access to regionalized care may reduce disparities in outcomes of total joint replacement.          ",Regionalization of elective total joint replacement,7305750,R03AR054063,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Caring ', ' Subgroup ', ' Rate ', ' Zip Code ', ' sex ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Surgical complication ', ' Knee ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Repeat Surgery ', ' Reoperation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Shoulder ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Localized ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Atlases ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' cohort ', ' Measures ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' ']",NIAMS,HOSPITAL FOR SPECIAL SURGERY,R03,2007,85392,0.03678303261656617
"Initiative for Minority Students: Bridges to the Doctor*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is rapidly becoming a more diverse nation; non-white racial and ethnic groups will constitute a majority of the American population by 2010. Efforts to increase the diversity of health professionals are imperative to achieve improved access to care for racial and ethnic minority patients, greater patient choice and satisfaction, and better educational experiences for health professions students. The need to increase the numbers of professional nurses who have the knowledge base, cultural sensitivity and research skills to provide solutions to the persistent health disparities that are plaguing this nation is urgent. This background is the foundation for this project that aims to prepare minority researchers and scholars through initiatives that emphasize cognitive skills development and role socialization. The ""Initiative for Minority Students: Bridges to the Doctorate"" is a collaborative effort of the nursing programs at Thomas Jefferson University and the University of Pennsylvania, combines the strengths of a highly focused, research-intensive school with the strengths of an academic unit that enjoys an established reputation for success in transitioning minority nurses into advanced nursing education programs. An academic component provides the knowledge base for statistical competence and transition to doctoral study while an experiential component allows students to participate in research projects currently being conducted by nursing faculty at the University Of Pennsylvania. Students will work with researchers and develop a research proposal suitable for the preparation of an application for an individual traineeship award from NIH. The project infrastructure will emphasize mentoring and provide the requisite resources to insure the readiness of project participants for matriculation in a doctoral nursing program.

"The significance of racial segregation for CV disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segregation has been widely studied as a cause of educational and socioeconomic inequities in American society. However, few studies have sought to quantify the degree of segregation that exists within individual health care markets, and virtually no studies have examined the impact of segregation on racial disparities in health care. This study will examine the link between segregation in health care markets and disparities in health care delivery for black and white patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a condition for which there exists substantial evidence of racial disparities. The specific aims are to: 1. Determine relationships between segregation and racial disparities in the use of coronary revascularization after acute myocardial infarction. 2. Determine relationships between segregation and racial disparities in mortality and readmission for acute coronary syndrome in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 3. Determine relationships between segregation and racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals. The 24-month study will analyze existing data for Medicare patients admitted for AMI to non-federal hospitals during a 10-year period from 1993 through 2002. The study will measure segregation in health care markets using two validated methods that have been widely used in sociology and will evaluate relationships between the segregation measures and racial disparities in the endpoints described above. Additional analyses will examine changes in segregation over time within individual markets and relationships between segregation and other health care market characteristics. The knowledge gained from this study about the significance of segregation as a determinant of racial disparity will be essential for designing effective strategies for eliminating disparities.             ",The significance of racial segregation for CV disease,7191618,R03AG027286,"['health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' End Point ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Implantable Defibrillators ', ' Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators ', ' density ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Hospitals ', ' Federal Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Time ', ' day ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' metropolitan ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' regional difference ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Total Arthroplasty of the Knee ', ' TKR - Total knee replacement ', ' Prosthetic total arthroplasty of the knee ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' End of Life Care ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R03,2007,64450,0.012758921622495527
"Diagnostic Markers of Language Impairment in Bilinguals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The estimated risk for language impairment (LI) in monolingual English speaking children is about 7%. A model for identifying language impairment, referred to as the EpiSLI system (Tomblin, Records, & Zhang, 1996), yields relatively high levels of specificity and sensitivity for identification of LI in kindergarten children from monolingual English speaking backgrounds. Systematic study is needed to determine a) the extent to which level of proficiency in English is related to risk for misidentification of language impairment, b) if the EpiSLI criteria can be applied to a new bilingual language test, c) to what extent testing (using a variety of assessment tasks) in English and the native language can be used to identify language impairment, and d) potential differences in the way bilingual learner's (language impaired vs. typical) performance on language measures changes with increased exposure to English. Due to the shortage of bilingual clinicians and the diversity of languages spoken in the US it would be helpful to determine the circumstances in which standardized testing, language learning measures, and/or processing measures administered in English can be used to reliably identify language impairment in bilingual children. We have planned a three phase study to address these issues. In phase 1, 1500 Latino children will participate in language screening to determine the levels of risk across the bilingual population. In phase 2, a comparison of performance on standardized measures in Spanish and English will be administered to the at risk bilingual children identified in phase 1 to determine if the EpiSLI cut off values fold for bilinguals. Further, processing and learning measures will be administered in English to explore the extent to which such measures accurately predict language impairment at various levels of English proficiency. In phase 3, children will participate in follow up testing evaluating language growth. Assessment of the persistence of language impairment across a 1 year period will help determine whether increase in English language skills affects classification accuracy of language impairment when measures are utilized in English.         ",Diagnostic Markers of Language Impairment in Bilinguals,7169886,R01DC007439,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Tests ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Numbers ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' bilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' Production ', ' Pathologist ', ' Koreans ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Records ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rice ', ' Risk ', ' Semantics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' English Language ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' Score ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Language ', ' Latino ', ' Process Measure ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' Impairment ', ' comparative ', ' ']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2007,595059,0.05626793033130811
"University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  To improve our overall academic environment, the RISE program was initiated in 1998 to prepare students to become scientists. As part of this long-term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in three areas: (1) their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, (2) their limited research skills and experience, and (3) limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, four developmental activities are prescribed--visiting scientists, research skills, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators both at UPR Cayey and at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 40 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the U.S. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: (1) research and language skills with on-campus faculty mentors, (2) motivational visiting scientists, and (3) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the U.S. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPR Cayey alumni who will be biomedical research scientists.      During the last 8 years, 20 MBRS alumni completed Ph.D.s and 40 alumni began their Ph.D. studies. By doubling the number of alumni entering doctoral programs, RISE will impact the community. These UPR Cayey scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases.          ",University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program,7249941,R25GM059429,"['Critiques ', ' Curiosities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Daughter ', ' Decision Making ', ' IACUC ', ' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' protein expression ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Impact of Nurse Work Environment on Rural Quality of Care and Clinical Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study addresses NINR's mission of eliminating health disparities due to geographic location. Rural hospitals are absent from existing studies that identify community factors (i.e. level of poverty) and organizational factors (i.e. the nurse work environment and hospital characteristics) that influence quality of care and clinical outcomes. In this proposed K01, structural contingency theory is used to conceptualize the association between the nurse work environment, rural community characteristics, hospital and nursing unit characteristics, quality of care, and clinical outcomes (Ml mortality). The goals of this proposed mentored research are to: a) develop a nurse assessed quality indicator and test this measure against established quality indicators (hospital collected, and large public data sets); b) evaluate the relationship between quality indicators and clinical outcomes in small rural hospitals; c) examine characteristics of the community, hospital, nursing unit, and nurse work environment that may influence quality of care indicators and Ml mortality in small rural hospitals. To accomplish this, the candidate will pursue a career development program, and will gain knowledge and proficiency in designing, developing, and using Web surveys; using large secondary public data bases; negotiating the special challenges that rural health research poses; and acquiring advanced knowledge of statistical methods and computer applications needed to do large scale studies using multilevel data. The candidate will be prepared to assume a lead role in planning and conducting complex rural nursing health studies. The training will be applied to the proposed study where small rural hospitals in two states will be invited to participate through their chief nursing officer. Data will be collected from multiple sources: Web-based staff nurse surveys, hospital administrative data, and large public data bases (i.e. Hospital Compare and state discharge data). The data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling and regression techniques. This study will form the basis for future research that includes an expansion of quality of care in the hospital to patient's quality of life after discharge. Findings from this study may inform administrators and policy makers on how quality of care and Ml mortality rates for patients in small rural hospitals are influenced by factors in the nurses' work environment as well as characteristics of the rural community, hospital, and nursing unit.          ",Impact of Nurse Work Environment on Rural Quality of Care and Clinical Outcomes,7357584,K01NR010556,"['Decubitus ulcer ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' patient safety ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' base ', ' career ', ' rural area ', ' Goals ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Distal ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Assessment ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Development ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Health ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Beds ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Disease regression ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Administrator ', ' Process Measure ', ' Rural Community ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K01,2007,86060,0.07794224159792916

"Family-Nurse Care Coordination Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) represent 12.8% of children nationally (9.3 million) and 13.1% of children in Florida. These children need and use more services from health, developmental, educational, and related systems. Disparities in access to care exist for some children (low income, minority, no insurance) and the financial impact (bills, time, lost employment) on families can be great. Families may not be aware of the resources available to them. Families also express frustration with finding and getting information and services. Care coordination is reported to improve access to services, satisfaction with care, and reduce costs. Yet, care coordination is not well described and effects on the family are unknown. Families don't always understand the services available to them, express dissatisfaction, or arrange services themselves. The purpose of this R21 mixed-method exploratory study is to develop and test a family-nurse care coordination intervention for families of CSHCN and their Title V nurse care coordinators. Our study is relevant to the NIH mission to develop effective interventions, improve access and quality of care, and reduce disparities. Aim 1 will explore family experience, knowledge, and satisfaction with coordination through telephone interviews of a random sample of 500 families. Qualitative interviews with a subsample (n=40) of families will explore strategies families use, barriers they face, and begin to elicit how having care coordination helps families. Nurse focus groups will identify factors that facilitate and challenge their work with families, understand what they do, and what they need. Aim 2 will use a community-based participatory approach, (parents, providers, nurses, researchers) to develop the intervention emphasizing a family-nurse partnership. We will do this through guided co-learning, search for existing materials, discussion, and will incorporate our preliminary research results from the survey and interviews into intervention development. We anticipate a curriculum related to navigating systems of care that incorporates a Care Notebook (child's health record). We will train peer-parents with the nurses in the identified intervnetion. Our CPBR team will also reflect and evaluate they way they worked together. Aim 3 will test the feasibility of a peer-parent outreach visit to 200 family participants to teach the curriculum and identify unmet needs. Pre-visit and post- visit briefings will take place between peer-parent and nurse. Families will also be offered an opportunity to review their child's Title V medical record. The qualitative family participant subsample will be re-interviewed to explore perceptions of the intervention and family-sensitive outcome measures. Our study has implications for how systems of coordination can be enhanced. It also has implications for the teaching and support of the families who do not qualify for coordination servcies and do it themselves. Families and nurses have much to teach each other, and other families, about how to achieve the best care for children.           ",Family-Nurse Care Coordination Partnership,7230056,R21NR009781,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Purpose ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Advocate ', ' Improve Access ', ' Qualifying ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Title ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Frustration ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Phase ', ' Information Services ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' satisfaction ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Nurses ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Family Nursing ', ' Family-Centered Nursing ', ' nursing intervention ', ' Budgets ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' health record ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Institutionalized Child ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH FLORIDA,R21,2007,136381,0.022441396110415467
"Heart Failure Clinical Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The proposed Heart Failure Regional Clinical Center (HF-RCC) application provides a unique opportunity to access practicing physicians as well as rural and minority outreach to support heart failure research and education. The network is an academic - community physicians partnership pioneered by the Morehouse School of Medicine Community Physicians' Network (CRN), to promote clinical research and practice based quality improvement. The network allows seamless integration of NIH supported clinical protocols at the community practice level. The HF RCC builds up on this model by bringing together the largest Cardiology group practice, in North Atlanta, known in the southeast USA for leading edge practice and research with 2 of the largest and oldest minority owned Cardiology practices in the South Metro Atlanta and surrounding rural communities. The extraordinary geographic reach of the network, its socioeconomic and ethnic diversity is evident from the Heart Failure Registry database, a summary of which is included with this application. Finally, the affiliations with St. Joseph's Hospital and Grady Hospital, large tertiary care centers, respectively known nationally for award winning cardiovascular care and outstanding care delivery to the underserved, provide unprecedented opportunity and credibility to impact cardiovascular care and health disparities. The longstanding mission of MSM to promote equitable care for all is the ultimate engine and passion that drives the network. Indeed participating practices and hospitals have cited this commitment as a key motivator for their interest in the Community Physicians' Network. We have proposed an infrastructure based on our experience and expertise in recruiting and retaining difficult to reach patient populations. The two projects provide an opportunity to fully exploit the intellectual and infrastructure capacity of the Network. Both projects capitalize on the size of the Heart Failure patient population in our RCC, as well as expertise of investigators. Project one draws upon our research interest in remodeling in hypertensive heart disease and heart failure, and also takes advantage of our group's interest in the role of   NO in cardiac and vascular remodeling. The second project is largely based on the expertise of our   collaborator, Nicholas Chronos, MD in cell based therapies in preclinical and early phase clinical trials. The proposed clinical skills development core integrates existing clinical training resource such as the   successful Master of Science in Clinical Research Program at MSM and the sought after cardiovascular   research training program at St. Joseph's Research Institute. In summary, we have proposed a very unique application which should serve as a model for future collaborative research networks that seek to actively engage and integrate community practices, a key stated goals of the NIH to map initiative.

"A Partnership for Clinician EHR Use and Quality of Care The Institute for Nursing Centers and the Alliance of Chicago propose to study the effectiveness of a partnership that shares resources, and utilizes a data-driven approach to promote full clinician use of an EHR in three nurse managed health centers and three community health centers in order to improve the quality of care in areas of preventive care, chronic disease management, and medication management for vulnerable populations. These partners have a track record of highly productive research, successful EHR implementation, commitment to data-supported high quality health care for vulnerable populations, and a history of building and maintaining strong collaborations. The goals of this project address one of the key problems in leveraging health IT to support high quality patient care: the fact that despite the promise, clinical decision support is often not used effectively or consistently by clinicians even when an EHR is available. The research design incorporates quantitative and qualitative methods as well as individual and center level analyses. The critical link between full EHR use (including clinical decision support features) and clinical performance and quality outcomes will be examined with rigorous quantitative methodology. Quality indicators chosen are those that the Institute of Medicine has identified as priority areas for improvement, and are also in areas where significant disparities across race, ethnic, and income groups exist. Qualitative methodology will add to the field?s understanding of health center leadership and change management required for successful use of EHR.

"A Collaborative Approach to Control Hypertension in Diabetes (COACH-D)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many primary care patients, especially in inner-city settings, do not achieve targets for blood pressure and glycemic control. There is an urgent need to enhance treatment for those who do not reach goals within the usual clinical care system. We propose to develop a multi-component intervention grounded in the Chronic Care Model, and sustainable in resource-challenged settings. Through collaboration with home health nursing and with the use of home telemetry for feedback and intensification of therapy, we will augment usual clinical services to improve health outcomes for diabetes patients who have not been able to reach therapeutic goals. There are three specific aims. First, we will establish a feasible, practical and sustainable collaborative model between the primary care sites of our practice-based research network (NYC RING), clinical researchers at the Diabetes Research and Training Center, and The Montefiore Home Health Organization, integrating the unique expertise of each of the partners and defining the roles and responsibilities of each. Second, we will develop and refine the components of the intervention, to include training primary care providers and home health nurses to integrate the technical, psychosocial and communication processes for implementation of the intervention. Third, we will assess the feasibility of the collaborative intervention by implementing the intervention for 25 primary care patients and obtain preliminary estimates of effectiveness by comparing outcomes to 25 patients receiving usual care. Our proposal includes plans to develop feasible procedures for data collection, with qualitative and quantitative methods of assessing process and outcome measures. We will use these preliminary data to revise the intervention and prepare an R18 application to further develop and test the intervention in multiple inner- city primary care sites serving low-income diabetes patients. This proposal is for secondary prevention of diabetes complications, targeting a population known for health disparities and a high burden from this chronic disease.

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Efficiency    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our original P01 grant application was motivated by the remarkable differences in health care intensity in the US. In this resubmission, we sharpen our focus in three ways. The goal is to understand and improve efficiency, the target is a more actionable level for physicians and the hospitals where they work, and the means include collaborations with key stakeholders to design successful interventions. The projects are: 1. Measuring the Efficiency of Health Care Providers. This project develops measures of efficiency - both quality and costs - and explores their implications at the level of primary care physicians, physician groups, and hospitals. We use Medicare data, patient and physician surveys, and specialty board certification scores from the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Family Practice. 2. Causes and Consequences of Variation in Pharmacotherapy Efficiency. We describe and model variation in prescription drug use using longitudinal claims data from very large insurance providers in two states, studying both consequences of variation in prescription drug use in outcomes and the impact of a large, systemic 'shock' - Medicare Part D - on existing treatment patterns and outcomes. 3. Technological Growth and the Efficiency of Health Care Diffusion. We study the contribution of ""high- tech"" health care to cost growth, the diffusion of different types of medical innovations, whether high-quality health providers affect population-level health outcomes, and how provider networks affect diffusion. 4. Geography and Disparities in Health and Health Care. We propose hospital-level disparity ""report cards,"" to study sorting of patients to disproportionately Black hospitals and to test whether the preferences of patients from a recent nation-wide survey of Medicare enrollees are reflected in their treatments. Finally, we estimate how racial differences in surgical rates affect disparities in actual health outcomes. 5. Norms Governing Physician Decision-Making For Critically III Elders. We use qualitative methods to describe the norms and values that influence the use of life-sustaining treatments among critically ill elders in emergency rooms and hospitals. We plan to test the feasibility of one or more interventions to change practice norms with the broader aim of improving efficiency. Cores: The Cores include an initiative to work with seven leading hospitals to address inefficiency in the provision of care, data support, and health efficiency measures for users of the Health and Retirement Study. Relevance: The project seeks to understand why efficiency is so poor in the U.S. health care system: 30% of health care spending is wasted, and quality of care is seriously lacking. We also explore several approaches to improving quality and reducing unwarranted variations in expenditures.

"Safety Net Hospitals and Minority Access to Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Safety net hospitals play a critical role in the US health system providing access to health services for vulnerable populations, especially low-income racial and ethnic minorities. However, these hospitals have faced increasing strain over the last decade due to public and private payment pressures, growing demand for indigent care, and the growing concentration of this care in fewer institutions. Given this, the closure or ownership conversion of even a few safety net hospitals could have major effects on communities whose residents depend on these institutions. Although several studies have examined the hospital safety net and others have examined health disparities among racial and ethnic minority groups, little research has linked these two areas. The National Institute of Health's PA-05-006 identified this research as a priority because institutional policies, such as hospital closure or conversion, could affect the accessible supply of racial and ethnic minority health care providers and thus exacerbate racial and ethnic disparities in access to care, health status, and outcomes. Our proposed analysis examines how patterns of access are affected by safety net hospital contraction, examining its effects on minority and non-minority individuals living in low- income areas. We develop multiple measures of accessibility, accounting for a variety of place-specific factors not typically used in health services research, such as a multivariate factor reflecting physical/geographical impedance and measures of acculturation and residential segregation. We use these accessibility measures to identify communities with the greatest access impediments following safety net hosptial closure or conversion. We then undertake case study research to assess which groups of individuals, as distinguished by socioeconomic factors, were most affected when access to safety net resources declined in their communities and what policy interventions may have limited or exacerbated these detrimental effects. Our research is important given continued budget problems in several states and the federal govemement. In relation to the latter, 2005 legislative action reduced Medicaid spending by $10 billion between 2007 and 2010 and the 2007 Bush Administration budget application called for an additional $35 billion cut over a ten- year period. Such large reductions in Medicaid support could push more safety net hospitals to close or convert ownership. It is important for policy makers, the public, and the health industry to know what this might mean for access to care if the loss of financial support results in further safety net contraction.           ",Safety Net Hospitals and Minority Access to Health Care,7261609,R01HL082707,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Medical Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Closure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Emergency Care ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Financial Support ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' minority health ', ' Hospital Closures ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Indigent Care ', ' Indigent ', ' Industry ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Masks ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' pressure ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Private Hospitals ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' Budgets ', ' Burn Units ', ' payment ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' County ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Hospital safety ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NHLBI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,335409,-0.02474304482560589
"Disparties in Nursing Home Care by Race and Payer Status DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate, a recently graduated health economist, with additional training and research experience that will enable him to pursue an academic career in aging with a focus on the economics of nursing home quality care issues. In order to fully understand and investigate patient-level quality measures, the candidate will need to acquire specialized knowledge and skills. He proposes a career development plan with a mentoring team of senior faculty that will provide clinical, measurement, and modeling expertise in the use of patient-level data. The research program consists of a study of within-facility variation in the quality of nursing home care. The first aim of this study tests whether disparities in nursing home care and nursing home outcomes exist across Medicaid and private-pay residents within a common facility. The second aim of this study evaluates whether disparities in nursing home care and nursing home outcomes exist across racial and ethnic minority and majority residents within a common facility. By using recent MDS data over multiple years, the proposed study will greatly increase our understanding of differences in nursing home quality by payer status and race. The results will allow providers, advocates, clinicians, consumers and policymakers to better evaluate and address within-facility disparities in nursing home care.

"University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  To improve our overall academic environment, the RISE program was initiated in 1998 to prepare students to become scientists. As part of this long-term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in three areas: (1) their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, (2) their limited research skills and experience, and (3) limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, four developmental activities are prescribed--visiting scientists, research skills, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators both at UPR Cayey and at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 40 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the U.S. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: (1) research and language skills with on-campus faculty mentors, (2) motivational visiting scientists, and (3) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the U.S. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPR Cayey alumni who will be biomedical research scientists.      During the last 8 years, 20 MBRS alumni completed Ph.D.s and 40 alumni began their Ph.D. studies. By doubling the number of alumni entering doctoral programs, RISE will impact the community. These UPR Cayey scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases.

"Technological Home Care: Improving Caregiving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific aims of this study are to test the effects of a nursing intervention (FamTechCare) on family caregivers' problem solving ability, participation in health care management, health status, depression, quality of life, and health care services costs. Subjects in the study will be family caregivers (n= 80) and 80 adult patients dependent for survival on Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) infusions due to nonmalignant gastrointestinal disorders. Recruitment is through Kansas University Hospital and its rural outreach centers. Enrollment will be staggered over the project in order to assure adequate numbers and representative gender and racial distributions. Research methods include a placebo-controlled longitudinal clinical trial design with crossover and interventions delivered by videophone nurse visits, internet-based home care algorithm guides and by peer support. Peers are family caregivers with extensive HPN experience who will be trained to mentor dyads via videophone. These FamTechCare interventions are based on extensive preliminary data and include new, innovative extensions for this study. The entire intervention was pilot- tested and found feasible and not a burden. Questionnaires and laboratory data used to obtain pre- and post-intervention data are valid, sensitive to change and reliable and were completed in an average 20 minutes during pilot testing. Data analyses will include nested linear mixed model hypothesis testing to detect effects on caregiver/patient dyads. The novel concept of nurse caring conveyed via internet is also tested. Traditional cost analysis and the, innovative Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) will be used to describe each family's home care efficiency in relation to and health services costs. This study uses videophone and internet delivery which increases health care access and reduces health care disparities. The potential significance and the long term goals are to strengthen home caregiving skills, improve health status, quality of life and self-management of chronic illness symptoms and invasive home care treatment.         ",Technological Home Care: Improving Caregiving,7457909,R01NR009078,"['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Home Parenteral Nutrition ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Catheters ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' catheter related infection ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communication ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' cost ', ' Catheter-related bloodstream infection ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Reactive depression ', ' Neurotic Depressive Reaction ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Nursing ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Nutrition, Other ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Family ', ' Guidelines ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Placebo Control ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Algorithms ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Invasive ', ' Phase ', ' Infection ', ' Infusion Pumps ', ' Perfusion Pumps ', ' Infusors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ', ' Joint Commission on Accreditation, Health Care Organizations ', ' JCAHO ', ' Kansas ', ' Laboratories ', ' disability ', ' Numbers ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"Deaf People and Healthcare    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Steven Barnett MD is a family physician whose career has focused on healthcare with deaf people and families who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf people who communicate in ASL are a medically underserved and understudied vulnerable minority with much in common with other linguistic and socio cultural minority groups. Dr. Barnett's career goal is to be a leading expert and independent researcher on the topic of health and healthcare with deaf people and their families. The University of Rochester is an ideal place to work toward that goal, since Rochester has a large deaf population and the University of Rochester Medical Center is motivated to become a center of excellence on health promotion and disease prevention with people who are deaf. In order to achieve his goal, Dr. Barnett will pursue more advanced research training, including formal coursework in survey methods, epidemiology and sampling methods. He will also work with mentors, consultant and advisors to create individualized curricula focused on skills development in mixed quantitative and qualitative research methods, advanced ASL, and psychometrics, including issues related to translation and adaptation of English language tools for use with non-English populations. Dr. Barnett will work with his mentors, consultant and community advisory board to conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the healthcare experiences of deaf adult ASL-users. They will do this by translating and adapting the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) ambulatory care survey in order to collect information in ASL from deaf people about their healthcare experiences. They will administer CAHPS-ASL to four groups of deaf adult ASL-users in Rochester to learn about healthcare experiences in different settings. Dr. Barnett will bring the data and analyses back to his community advisory board and they will work together to plan future research and interventions to address the health and healthcare disparities experienced by deaf people and their families. CAHPS-ASL will be the first national survey adapted to learn about healthcare experiences from deaf adult ASL-users in their own language. Creating accessible research and addressing disparities are goals consistent with Healthy People 2010 objectives and essential to improve the quality and effectiveness of healthcare for this vulnerable population.           ",Deaf People and Healthcare,7498967,K08HS015700,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K08,2008,126862,0.029169048343253845

"Center for Vulnerable Populations Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to enhance strengths of communities to eliminate health disparities faced by vulnerable populations (VPs), with a particular focus on ethnic/racial minorities and people living in poverty. The CVPR has facilitated sharing and expanding resources to improve the competence of investigators studying health problems of VPs, to support ongoing evolution of the knowledge base and methods of VP research, and to develop collaborative relations with community partners. Goals of the CVPR in the next five years are to: 1) continue expanding the scientific knowledge base of health-related problems of VPs to a) reduce/eliminate health disparities; b) facilitate health promotion; and c) improve outcomes of nursing practice; 2) translate the knowledge, skills, and experience acquired in participatory research (PR) methods and community partnerships by university and community investigators into practice/action to improve the health status of VPs and to develop science in this area; 3) expand capacity to measure, analyze and link biologic and behavioral markers in VPs research; and 4) disseminate research findings to inform community partners, and to influence nursing, health policy development, ethical decision- making processes, and future research. The infrastructure of the CVPR supports achievement of these goals through a variety of research and educational activities conducted by 4 cores - Administrative, Bio Laboratory, Participatory Research and Community Partnerships (PRCPC) and Research Support. Over the past four years the interdisciplinary team of CVPR investigators and affiliates have established several community partnerships and university collaborations and developed a unique scientific interface between behavioral and biologic researchers studying VPs. By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of VP research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center Investigators are effectively addressing important health and nursing issues. The community-based partnerships provide a solid foundation for further development of the CVPR as an epicenter for research and training in community-based PR to reduce health disparities. Current and planned CVPR research addresses elimination of health disparities in areas related to infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A/B/C, tuberculosis), chronic illness (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma) substance use, and environmental quality. Continuance of the CVPR will enable investigators to sustain and expand efforts to confront health disparities in Los Angeles and the nation, to address national health goals established by several governmental agencies, and to build community capacity.

"Social Support, Self-Management, and Hospital Use for Heart Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly African Americans with heart failure are more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure compared to their white counterparts. However, African Americans with heart failure also frequently have similar or even lower 1- year mortality compared to white heart failure patients. Previous studies have shown that factors such as post-discharge care, the unique role of heart failure among African Americans, comorbidities, and access to care may account for the some of disparities in hospital use. However, fewer studies have examined non-clinical factors such as patient social support. Social support is essential to the successful outpatient management of heart failure, particularly among the elderly. Social support, provided by family or friends, may facilitate the adoption of and adherence to self-management behaviors such as checking daily weights and maintaining a low sodium diet. Social support may decrease heart failure morbidity through this mediating role in the relationship between self-management behaviors and hospital use for heart failure. The proposed research will include a prospective cohort study of African American and white adults over age 40 previously hospitalized for heart failure 1) to assess the relationship between social support and heart failure 2) to assess the relationship between self-management behaviors and hospital use for heart failure 3) to measure the extent to which social support mediates the relationship between self-management behavior and hospital use for heart failure. Study participants will be selected using administrative data on hospital discharges from a single large teaching hospital. At study entry, a survey instrument will be administered with validated scales to measure social support and self-management behaviors. In addition, other data on trust in physicians, comorbidities, functional status, medication use and adherence will be collected via the survey. At the end of the 1-year follow-up period, administrative hospital data will be used to measure hospital use for heart failure at the same teaching hospital for all study participants during the previous 12 months. In the data analysis, multivariable modeling will be used to examine the independent relationships of both social support and self- management behaviors with hospital use for heart failure in this diverse cohort. Furthermore, sequential model building will be utilized to determine if social support is a mediator in the relationship between self-management behaviors and hospital use for heart failure. The proposed research will help to elucidate the relationships among these patient factors and hospital use for heart failure. Additionally, the research should inform future work in the design of community-based interventions to augment or optimize social support in efforts to address racial disparities in hospital use for heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure affects about 2.6% of adults in the US and is the leading cause of hospitalizations annually among Medicare beneficiaries. Racial disparities in hospital use for heart failure reflect a higher burden of disease among elderly African Americans with heart failure compared to whites. The elucidation of the role of social support as it relates to self-management behaviors and hospital use for heart failure is essential to the creation and implementation of community-based interventions to address these health care disparities.           Heart failure affects about 2.6% of adults in the US and is the leading cause of hospitalizations annually among Medicare beneficiaries.

"A Partnership for Clinician EHR Use and Quality of Care The Institute for Nursing Centers and the Alliance of Chicago propose to study the effectiveness of a partnership that shares resources, and utilizes a data-driven approach to promote full clinician use of an EHR in three nurse managed health centers and three community health centers in order to improve the quality of care in areas of preventive care, chronic disease management, and medication management for vulnerable populations. These partners have a track record of highly productive research, successful EHR implementation, commitment to data-supported high quality health care for vulnerable populations, and a history of building and maintaining strong collaborations. The goals of this project address one of the key problems in leveraging health IT to support high quality patient care: the fact that despite the promise, clinical decision support is often not used effectively or consistently by clinicians even when an EHR is available. The research design incorporates quantitative and qualitative methods as well as individual and center level analyses. The critical link between full EHR use (including clinical decision support features) and clinical performance and quality outcomes will be examined with rigorous quantitative methodology. Quality indicators chosen are those that the Institute of Medicine has identified as priority areas for improvement, and are also in areas where significant disparities across race, ethnic, and income groups exist. Qualitative methodology will add to the field?s understanding of health center leadership and change management required for successful use of EHR.

"Heart Failure Clinical Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The proposed Heart Failure Regional Clinical Center (HF-RCC) application provides a unique opportunity to access practicing physicians as well as rural and minority outreach to support heart failure research and education. The network is an academic - community physicians partnership pioneered by the Morehouse School of Medicine Community Physicians' Network (CRN), to promote clinical research and practice based quality improvement. The network allows seamless integration of NIH supported clinical protocols at the community practice level. The HF RCC builds up on this model by bringing together the largest Cardiology group practice, in North Atlanta, known in the southeast USA for leading edge practice and research with 2 of the largest and oldest minority owned Cardiology practices in the South Metro Atlanta and surrounding rural communities. The extraordinary geographic reach of the network, its socioeconomic and ethnic diversity is evident from the Heart Failure Registry database, a summary of which is included with this application. Finally, the affiliations with St. Joseph's Hospital and Grady Hospital, large tertiary care centers, respectively known nationally for award winning cardiovascular care and outstanding care delivery to the underserved, provide unprecedented opportunity and credibility to impact cardiovascular care and health disparities. The longstanding mission of MSM to promote equitable care for all is the ultimate engine and passion that drives the network. Indeed participating practices and hospitals have cited this commitment as a key motivator for their interest in the Community Physicians' Network. We have proposed an infrastructure based on our experience and expertise in recruiting and retaining difficult to reach patient populations. The two projects provide an opportunity to fully exploit the intellectual and infrastructure capacity of the Network. Both projects capitalize on the size of the Heart Failure patient population in our RCC, as well as expertise of investigators. Project one draws upon our research interest in remodeling in hypertensive heart disease and heart failure, and also takes advantage of our group's interest in the role of   NO in cardiac and vascular remodeling. The second project is largely based on the expertise of our   collaborator, Nicholas Chronos, MD in cell based therapies in preclinical and early phase clinical trials.

"The Caregiving Trajectory for Community-Dwelling Mexican-American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caregiving burden among Hispanic caregivers is a little understood and growing problem. As a result, research to address caregiver burden and prevent institutionalization in these populations is critical. It is estimated that there are over 42 million Hispanics in the U.S. and the cohort over age 65 is expected to grow faster than any other racial or ethnic group, tripling in number by 2050. Thirteen percent of Hispanic households currently provide care to an adult aged 50 or older whose life expectancy will increase to 87 years by 2050, surpassing all other ethnic groups. Given this dramatic shift in demographics, a burgeoning number of Hispanic families will be placed in a caregiving role. The purpose of this proposed study is to investigate the burden of caregiving in this at-risk population by describing the level, circumstances, and consequences of caregiver burden/strain, and determining the impact of cultural and contextual variables on caregiving and caregiver gain, along with factors that lead to nursing home admission. This proposed project is a longitudinal mixed methods descriptive study designed to intensively explore the natural course of caregiving, caregiving burden and strain, caregiver gain, and admission to nursing homes among Mexican-American families. One hundred ten caregiver-care recipient cases will be enrolled and followed for 15 months. Interviews and standardized questionnaires will be completed at baseline and every 10 weeks, with an additional measurement point if nursing home admission occurs. We will compare and contrast transitions and turning points in the caregiving trajectory (taking into account acculturation, the nature of the caregiver-care recipient relationship, gender, functional and cognitive status, and depression); identify factors that support caregiving; and determine what factors are most important in delaying institutionalization. The core component will be a case-oriented approach, that is, an intensive, qualitatively-driven, study of cases with an eye toward configurations of similarities and differences. A simultaneous, complementary, quantitatively-driven variable-oriented component will look for broad patterns across cases and enable the drawing of inferences based on these broad patterns. These approaches will be integrated throughout the analytic and interpretive phases of the study. This in-depth, systematic research into the caregiving trajectory should prove useful in designing interventions that are timed to occur simultaneously with known crisis points and help keep elders at home or to help families acknowledge when formal nursing home care should be sought. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using life course perspective, this longitudinal, descriptive, mixed methods study is designed to explore the natural course of caregiving, caregiving burden and strain, caregiver gain, and admission to nursing homes among 110 Mexican-American families. The core component will be a case-oriented approach, that is, an intensive, qualitatively-driven, study of cases with an eye toward configurations of similarities and differences. A simultaneous, complementary, quantitatively-driven variable-oriented component will look for broad patterns across cases and enable the drawing of inferences based on these broad patterns. We will compare and contrast transitions and turning points in the caregiving trajectory (taking into account acculturation, the nature of the caregiver-care recipient relationship, gender, functional and cognitive status, and depression); identify factors that support caregiving; and determine what factors are most important in delaying nursing home admission.          ",The Caregiving Trajectory for Community-Dwelling Mexican-American Elders,7524953,R01NR010541,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Purpose ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' TimeLine ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Family ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' minority health ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Household ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' indexing ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Americas ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) ', ' United States National Academy of Sciences ', ' National Academy of Sciences ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Perception ', ' German population ', ' German ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Deterioration ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Sleeplessness ', ' Insomnia Disorder ', ' Insomnia ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving burden ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' demographics ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Time ', ' Week ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' vigilance ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' ']",NINR,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2008,457019,0.02257275559067403
"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Efficiency    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our original P01 grant application was motivated by the remarkable differences in health care intensity in the US. In this resubmission, we sharpen our focus in three ways. The goal is to understand and improve efficiency, the target is a more actionable level for physicians and the hospitals where they work, and the means include collaborations with key stakeholders to design successful interventions. The projects are: 1. Measuring the Efficiency of Health Care Providers. This project develops measures of efficiency - both quality and costs - and explores their implications at the level of primary care physicians, physician groups, and hospitals. We use Medicare data, patient and physician surveys, and specialty board certification scores from the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Family Practice. 2. Causes and Consequences of Variation in Pharmacotherapy Efficiency. We describe and model variation in prescription drug use using longitudinal claims data from very large insurance providers in two states, studying both consequences of variation in prescription drug use in outcomes and the impact of a large, systemic 'shock' - Medicare Part D - on existing treatment patterns and outcomes. 3. Technological Growth and the Efficiency of Health Care Diffusion. We study the contribution of ""high- tech"" health care to cost growth, the diffusion of different types of medical innovations, whether high-quality health providers affect population-level health outcomes, and how provider networks affect diffusion. 4. Geography and Disparities in Health and Health Care. We propose hospital-level disparity ""report cards,"" to study sorting of patients to disproportionately Black hospitals and to test whether the preferences of patients from a recent nation-wide survey of Medicare enrollees are reflected in their treatments. Finally, we estimate how racial differences in surgical rates affect disparities in actual health outcomes. 5. Norms Governing Physician Decision-Making For Critically III Elders. We use qualitative methods to describe the norms and values that influence the use of life-sustaining treatments among critically ill elders in emergency rooms and hospitals. We plan to test the feasibility of one or more interventions to change practice norms with the broader aim of improving efficiency. Cores: The Cores include an initiative to work with seven leading hospitals to address inefficiency in the provision of care, data support, and health efficiency measures for users of the Health and Retirement Study. Relevance: The project seeks to understand why efficiency is so poor in the U.S. health care system: 30% of health care spending is wasted, and quality of care is seriously lacking. We also explore several approaches to improving quality and reducing unwarranted variations in expenditures.

"Safety Net Hospitals and Minority Access to Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Safety net hospitals play a critical role in the US health system providing access to health services for vulnerable populations, especially low-income racial and ethnic minorities. However, these hospitals have faced increasing strain over the last decade due to public and private payment pressures, growing demand for indigent care, and the growing concentration of this care in fewer institutions. Given this, the closure or ownership conversion of even a few safety net hospitals could have major effects on communities whose residents depend on these institutions. Although several studies have examined the hospital safety net and others have examined health disparities among racial and ethnic minority groups, little research has linked these two areas. The National Institute of Health's PA-05-006 identified this research as a priority because institutional policies, such as hospital closure or conversion, could affect the accessible supply of racial and ethnic minority health care providers and thus exacerbate racial and ethnic disparities in access to care, health status, and outcomes. Our proposed analysis examines how patterns of access are affected by safety net hospital contraction, examining its effects on minority and non-minority individuals living in low- income areas. We develop multiple measures of accessibility, accounting for a variety of place-specific factors not typically used in health services research, such as a multivariate factor reflecting physical/geographical impedance and measures of acculturation and residential segregation. We use these accessibility measures to identify communities with the greatest access impediments following safety net hosptial closure or conversion. We then undertake case study research to assess which groups of individuals, as distinguished by socioeconomic factors, were most affected when access to safety net resources declined in their communities and what policy interventions may have limited or exacerbated these detrimental effects. Our research is important given continued budget problems in several states and the federal govemement. In relation to the latter, 2005 legislative action reduced Medicaid spending by $10 billion between 2007 and 2010 and the 2007 Bush Administration budget application called for an additional $35 billion cut over a ten- year period. Such large reductions in Medicaid support could push more safety net hospitals to close or convert ownership. It is important for policy makers, the public, and the health industry to know what this might mean for access to care if the loss of financial support results in further safety net contraction.           ",Safety Net Hospitals and Minority Access to Health Care,7392769,R01HL082707,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Medical Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Closure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Emergency Care ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Financial Support ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' minority health ', ' Hospital Closures ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Indigent Care ', ' Indigent ', ' Industry ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Masks ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' pressure ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Private Hospitals ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' Budgets ', ' Burn Units ', ' payment ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' County ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Hospital safety ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NHLBI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,357031,-0.02474304482560589
"Impact of Nurse Work Environment on Rural Quality of Care and Clinical Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study addresses NINR's mission of eliminating health disparities due to geographic location. Rural hospitals are absent from existing studies that identify community factors (i.e. level of poverty) and organizational factors (i.e. the nurse work environment and hospital characteristics) that influence quality of care and clinical outcomes. In this proposed K01, structural contingency theory is used to conceptualize the association between the nurse work environment, rural community characteristics, hospital and nursing unit characteristics, quality of care, and clinical outcomes (Ml mortality). The goals of this proposed mentored research are to: a) develop a nurse assessed quality indicator and test this measure against established quality indicators (hospital collected, and large public data sets); b) evaluate the relationship between quality indicators and clinical outcomes in small rural hospitals; c) examine characteristics of the community, hospital, nursing unit, and nurse work environment that may influence quality of care indicators and Ml mortality in small rural hospitals. To accomplish this, the candidate will pursue a career development program, and will gain knowledge and proficiency in designing, developing, and using Web surveys; using large secondary public data bases; negotiating the special challenges that rural health research poses; and acquiring advanced knowledge of statistical methods and computer applications needed to do large scale studies using multilevel data. The candidate will be prepared to assume a lead role in planning and conducting complex rural nursing health studies. The training will be applied to the proposed study where small rural hospitals in two states will be invited to participate through their chief nursing officer. Data will be collected from multiple sources: Web-based staff nurse surveys, hospital administrative data, and large public data bases (i.e. Hospital Compare and state discharge data). The data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling and regression techniques. This study will form the basis for future research that includes an expansion of quality of care in the hospital to patient's quality of life after discharge. Findings from this study may inform administrators and policy makers on how quality of care and Ml mortality rates for patients in small rural hospitals are influenced by factors in the nurses' work environment as well as characteristics of the rural community, hospital, and nursing unit.          ",Impact of Nurse Work Environment on Rural Quality of Care and Clinical Outcomes,7503495,K01NR010556,"['Decubitus ulcer ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' patient safety ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' base ', ' career ', ' rural area ', ' Goals ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Distal ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Assessment ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Development ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Health ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Beds ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Disease regression ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Administrator ', ' Process Measure ', ' Rural Community ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K01,2008,85890,0.07794224159792916
"Heart Failure Clinical Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The proposed Heart Failure Regional Clinical Center (HF-RCC) application provides a unique opportunity to access practicing physicians as well as rural and minority outreach to support heart failure research and education. The network is an academic - community physicians partnership pioneered by the Morehouse School of Medicine Community Physicians' Network (CRN), to promote clinical research and practice based quality improvement. The network allows seamless integration of NIH supported clinical protocols at the community practice level. The HF RCC builds up on this model by bringing together the largest Cardiology group practice, in North Atlanta, known in the southeast USA for leading edge practice and research with 2 of the largest and oldest minority owned Cardiology practices in the South Metro Atlanta and surrounding rural communities. The extraordinary geographic reach of the network, its socioeconomic and ethnic diversity is evident from the Heart Failure Registry database, a summary of which is included with this application. Finally, the affiliations with St. Joseph's Hospital and Grady Hospital, large tertiary care centers, respectively known nationally for award winning cardiovascular care and outstanding care delivery to the underserved, provide unprecedented opportunity and credibility to impact cardiovascular care and health disparities. The longstanding mission of MSM to promote equitable care for all is the ultimate engine and passion that drives the network. Indeed participating practices and hospitals have cited this commitment as a key motivator for their interest in the Community Physicians' Network. We have proposed an infrastructure based on our experience and expertise in recruiting and retaining difficult to reach patient populations. The two projects provide an opportunity to fully exploit the intellectual and infrastructure capacity of the Network. Both projects capitalize on the size of the Heart Failure patient population in our RCC, as well as expertise of investigators. Project one draws upon our research interest in remodeling in hypertensive heart disease and heart failure, and also takes advantage of our group's interest in the role of   NO in cardiac and vascular remodeling. The second project is largely based on the expertise of our   collaborator, Nicholas Chronos, MD in cell based therapies in preclinical and early phase clinical trials. The proposed clinical skills development core integrates existing clinical training resource such as the   successful Master of Science in Clinical Research Program at MSM and the sought after cardiovascular   research training program at St. Joseph's Research Institute. In summary, we have proposed a very unique application which should serve as a model for future collaborative research networks that seek to actively engage and integrate community practices, a key stated goals of the NIH to map initiative.

Through collaboration with home health nursing and with the use of home telemetry for feedback and intensification of therapy, we will augment usual clinical services to improve health outcomes for diabetes patients who have not been able to reach therapeutic goals. There are three specific aims. First, we will establish a feasible, practical and sustainable collaborative model between the primary care sites of our practice-based research network (NYC RING), clinical researchers at the Diabetes Research and Training Center, and The Montefiore Home Health Organization, integrating the unique expertise of each of the partners and defining the roles and responsibilities of each. Second, we will develop and refine the components of the intervention, to include training primary care providers and home health nurses to integrate the technical, psychosocial and communication processes for implementation of the intervention. Third, we will assess the feasibility of the collaborative intervention by implementing the intervention for 25 primary care patients and obtain preliminary estimates of effectiveness by comparing outcomes to 25 patients receiving usual care. Our proposal includes plans to develop feasible procedures for data collection, with qualitative and quantitative methods of assessing process and outcome measures. We will use these preliminary data to revise the intervention and prepare an R18 application to further develop and test the intervention in multiple inner- city primary care sites serving low-income diabetes patients. This proposal is for secondary prevention of diabetes complications, targeting a population known for health disparities and a high burden from this chronic disease. Many primary care patients, especially in inner-city settings, do not achieve targets for blood pressure and glycemic control. We propose to develop a multi-component intervention grounded in the Chronic Care Model, and sustainable in resource- challenged settings. Through collaboration with home health nursing and with the use of home telemetry for feedback and intensification of therapy, we will augment usual clinical services to improve health outcomes for diabetes patients who have not been able to reach therapeutic goals.

"Educational Television Program for Children of Immigrant Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The language barrier between immigrant parents and their English-dominant children is a pervasive and relatively unrecognized problem in an estimated 12 million U.S. households. This intergenerational language gap often leads to adverse health outcomes for both children and adults for the following reasons: (1) it hinders young children's ability to communicate with their parents when they feel sick; and (2) as children are inevitably relied upon as interpreters for family members during office visits and medical emergencies, they are ill-prepared both linguistically and mentally for such a difficult task.  This project seeks to develop a television program that can bridge the intergenerational language gap and improve the health status of all members of an immigrant household. During our Phase I study, we developed a pilot episode and successfully demonstrated that it was an effective tool for achieving both of the stated educational goals. This Phase II proposal seeks to build on that foundation and create a six-episode animated series, focusing on the issue of childhood nutrition and obesity prevention amongst the Hispanic population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed project will develop an innovative television series that combines language and health education and can be enjoyed by both children and parents. The television program aims to enhance children's language skills in their heritage language, improve immigrant parents' English proficiency, provide exposure to important health concepts, and promote intergenerational communication.             ",Educational Television Program for Children of Immigrant Families,7482177,R44HD054080,"['Sesame - dietary ', ' Sesame ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Length ', ' Advocate ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Family ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Institutes ', ' Ensure ', ' Language ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Learning ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' New York ', ' Immigrant ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Exposure to ', ' Daily ', ' Program Development ', ' tool ', ' grandparent ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' programs ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Television ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Writing ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' instructor ', ' Services ', ' pediatric department ', ' age group ', ' elementary school ', ' sociolinguistics ', ' intergenerational ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Controlled Study ', ' outreach ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Child Language ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' obesity prevention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' ']",NICHD,"TRANSCENDENT INTERNATIONAL, LLC",R44,2008,887483,0.02693819907682414
"Disparties in Nursing Home Care by Race and Payer Status DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate, a recently graduated health economist, with additional training and research experience that will enable him to pursue an academic career in aging with a focus on the economics of nursing home quality care issues. In order to fully understand and investigate patient-level quality measures, the candidate will need to acquire specialized knowledge and skills. He proposes a career development plan with a mentoring team of senior faculty that will provide clinical, measurement, and modeling expertise in the use of patient-level data. The research program consists of a study of within-facility variation in the quality of nursing home care. The first aim of this study tests whether disparities in nursing home care and nursing home outcomes exist across Medicaid and private-pay residents within a common facility. The second aim of this study evaluates whether disparities in nursing home care and nursing home outcomes exist across racial and ethnic minority and majority residents within a common facility. By using recent MDS data over multiple years, the proposed study will greatly increase our understanding of differences in nursing home quality by payer status and race. The results will allow providers, advocates, clinicians, consumers and policymakers to better evaluate and address within-facility disparities in nursing home care.

"Disparities in Post-Acute Rehabilitation Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad long-term objective of this research is to inform the development of interventions that will improve access to, use of, and quality of post-acute rehabilitation care for underserved populations. The primary objective of the proposed study is to gain a more thorough and current understanding of disparities in the use of post-acute rehabilitation care following hip fracture, joint replacement, and stroke. This study proposes to pool and analyze state-specific hospital discharge data from four geographically and demographically diverse states (AZ, FL, NJ, WI). The hospital discharge data will be merged with data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey database, the Area Resource File, and U.S. Census data. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable regression analyses for discrete outcomes, including multi-level analyses, will be conducted for each condition to achieve the following specific aims:       1) Describe the sociodemographic (race, ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic status) and geographic disparities (urban/rural, state) in the use of post-acute rehabilitation care. Through descriptive and bivariate analyses of the data, we will determine the extent to which use of post-acute rehabilitation care varies by each sociodemographic and geographic characteristic.       2) Determine the extent to which identified sociodemographic and geographic disparities are explained by other observed characteristics. Through a series of multivariable analyses examining individual and community-level characteristics associated with the use of post-acute rehabilitation care and through the use of decomposition techniques we will determine the extent to which the identified disparities are explained by other observed characteristics. More specifically, we will determine the extent to which the identified disparities are: a. confounded by other observed characteristics (e.g., insurance status and/or disease severity may explain some of the racial differences in use; marital status may explain some of the gender differences in use); b. moderated by other observed characteristics (e.g., disparities in use may differ for low income and high income minorities); c. explained by individual versus community-level characteristics (we hypothesize that both individual and community-level factors will explain differences in use); and d. unexplained by the characteristics examined in this study (we hypothesize that some of the identified differences in use will be unexplained). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Post-acute rehabilitation care is an effective and growing area of health care that has not been adequately investigated in regard to health care disparities. Identifying the extent to which disparities exist in post-acute rehabilitation care and determining underlying reasons for these disparities are necessary first steps in developing interventions to eliminate these disparities.             ",Disparities in Post-Acute Rehabilitation Care,7440563,R21HD057980,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Purpose ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Series ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Intermediate Care Facilities ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Marital Status ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Payment System ', ' Prospective Reimbursement ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Belief ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Elderly woman ', ' American ', ' income insurance ', ' cohort ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' Count ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2008,218854,-0.018854260418208514
"Regionalization of elective total joint replacement    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     There is a strong relationship between hospital and surgeon volume and outcomes of total joint replacement. Therefore, regionalization, the movement of cases from low volume hospitals to high volume hospitals, of elective total joint replacements may be beneficial. The possible benefits of regionalization include improved patient outcomes and lower health care costs through a decreased rate of complications and revision surgery. However, the benefits of regionalization may not be equitably distributed if traditionally underserved patients face barriers to seeking regionalized care. Differential access to regionalized surgical care could possibly widen health disparities that already exist.      The aims of this research are: 1) to describe the frequency and predictors of regionalization of elective total joint replacement in the US; and 2) to assess whether regionalization for elective total joint replacement is associated with improved short-term patient outcomes. These aims will be accomplished by identifying the percentage of patients undergoing total joint replacements who traveled beyond their hospital service area (HSA) to undergo total joint replacement at a higher volume hospital in another HSA. Those who receive care in their local HSA will be considered ""localized"" while those who receive care elsewhere will be considered ""regionalized.""      Patients will be identified through existing hospital discharge databases for 21 states throughout the US. The effects of patient, age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status and comorbidity on the likelihood of receiving regionalized care will be evaluated using multivariable repeated measures models including methods that account for the correlation of procedures performed by the same surgeon or within the same hospital. To determine whether regionalization improves short-term outcomes, rates of surgical complication and revision procedures will be compared between patients who regionalize and those who do not, adjusting for potential confounders.      The results of this research will provide important insights regarding predictors and outcomes of regionalized orthopedic care. If regionalization is associated with reduced rates of surgical complications and revision procedures, and if regionalization is less common among traditionally underserved populations, then interventions to increase access to regionalized care may reduce disparities in outcomes of total joint replacement.          ",Regionalization of elective total joint replacement,7483279,R03AR054063,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Caring ', ' Subgroup ', ' Rate ', ' Zip Code ', ' sex ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Surgical complication ', ' Knee ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Repeat Surgery ', ' Reoperation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Shoulder ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Localized ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Atlases ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' cohort ', ' Measures ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' ']",NIAMS,HOSPITAL FOR SPECIAL SURGERY,R03,2008,85750,0.03678303261656617
"Diagnostic Markers of Language Impairment in Bilinguals The estimated risk for language impairment (LI)in monolingual English speaking children is about 7%. A model for identifying language impairment, referredto as the EpiSLI system (Tomblin, Records, & Zhang, 1996), yields relatively high levels of specificity and sensitivity for identification of LI in kindergarten children from monolingual English speaking backgrounds. Systematic study is needed to determine a) the extent to which level of proficiency in English is related to risk for misidentification of language impairment, b) if the EpiSLI criteria can be applied to a new bilingual language test, c) to what extent testing (using a variety of assessment tasks) in English and the native language can be used to identify language impairment, and d) potential differences in the way bilingual learner's (language impaired vs. typical) performance on language measures changes with increased exposure to English. Due to the shortage of bilingual clinicians and the diversity of languages spoken in the US it would be helpful to determine the circumstances in which standardized testing, language learning measures, and/or processing measures administered in English can be used to reliably identify language impairment in bilingual children. We have planned a three phase study to address these issues. In phase 1,1500 Latino children will participate in language screening to determine the levels of risk across the bilingual population. In phase 2, a comparison of performance on standardized measures in Spanish and English will be administered to the at risk bilingual children identified in phase 1 to determine if the EpiSLI cut off values fold for bilinguals. Further, processing and learning measures will be administered in English to explore the extent to which such measures accurately predict language impairment at various levels of English proficiency. In phase 3, children will participate in follow up testing evaluating language growth. Assessment of the persistance of language impairment across a 1 year period will help determine whether increase in English language skills affects classification accuracy of language impairment when measures are utilized in English.

"University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program To improve our overall academic environment, the RISE program was initiated in 1998to prepare students to become scientists. As part of this long term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in three areas, 1- their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, 2- their limited research skills and experience, and 3- limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs four developmental activities are prescribed- visiting scientists, research skills, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators both at UPR-Cayeyand at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 40 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the USA. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: 1) research and language skills with on-campus faculty mentors, 2) motivational visiting scientists, and 3) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the USA. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPRC alumni who will be biomedical research scientists. During the last 8 years, 20 MBRS Alumni completed Ph.D.s and 40 alumni began their Ph.D. studies. By doubling the number of alumni entering doctoral programs, RISE will impact the community. These UPRC scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases.

"University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  To improve our overall academic environment, the RISE program was initiated in 1998 to prepare students to become scientists. As part of this long-term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in three areas: (1) their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, (2) their limited research skills and experience, and (3) limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, four developmental activities are prescribed--visiting scientists, research skills, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators both at UPR Cayey and at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 40 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the U.S. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: (1) research and language skills with on-campus faculty mentors, (2) motivational visiting scientists, and (3) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the U.S. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPR Cayey alumni who will be biomedical research scientists.      During the last 8 years, 20 MBRS alumni completed Ph.D.s and 40 alumni began their Ph.D. studies. By doubling the number of alumni entering doctoral programs, RISE will impact the community. These UPR Cayey scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases.

"Phenotype Assessment Tools:Bilingual(Spanish-English)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The bilingual population in the United States is one of the fastest growing school-age populations. Yet there are few diagnostic instruments that accurately distinguish between bilingual children with and without language impairment (LI). Development between 7 and 9 years of age is of interest because this is the age at which children who are acquiring a second language are more likely to be identified with LI (as compared to a younger age). While many of the children in this broad population typically have already had exposure to English, most are still within the 5 to 7 year time frame they need to acquire academic language. This makes identification of LI particularly challenging. Scientific knowledge about LI in bilingual children has improved over the last 10 years, but such knowledge has not been systematically translated into assessment instruments. Thus, an innovative aspect of this application is that we extend a recently developed protocol to an age group where there is a critical need for such instruments. In response to RFA-DC-05-001, Typical/Disordered Language: Phenotype Assessment Tools we have planned a two phase study to develop an upward extension of the Bilingual English Spanish Assessment (BESA; a NIDCD supported instrument) for children aged 7 to 9 years. In Phase I we develop an item set and test it on 136 Spanish English bilinguals with and without LI (focusing on 8 year olds). We then submit these items to analyses and reduce the item set to those which have the greatest potential to discriminate between children with and without LI. In Phase 2, the reduced item set will be tested on 134 bilinguals with and without LI (extending to 7 and 9 year olds). These items sets will be used to generate interrelated psychometric parallel versions of the BESA (for identification purposes) and linguistic parallel versions of the BESA (for research purposes). These steps will provide the information needed to conduct longitudinal studies of bilingual language development and disorders. These will be addressed in future applications. Language impairment is a developmental disability that interferes with education and other life functions of individuals. There are disparities in the identification of language impairment in minority populations such as Latino children who speak English and Spanish. This application addresses this concern by working to develop an assessment protocol to improve identification of bilingual children with language impairment.         ",Phenotype Assessment Tools:Bilingual(Spanish-English),7416591,R21HD053223,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Purpose ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Range ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Tests ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' bilingualism ', ' Phenotype ', ' Exposure to ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Psychometrics ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Speech-Language Pathology ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Side ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' skills ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Competence ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Speech Development ', ' theories ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 6 year old ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' 9 year old ', ' nine year old ', ' age 9 years ', ' Impairment ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2008,201615,0.032041334353118865
"Understanding Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many studies have documented important racial disparities in surgical outcomes but their etiologies are not clear. While we generally find better surgical outcomes (lower mortality) at teaching hospitals, and a higher rate of minority patients at these hospitals, the survival benefit at teaching hospitals does not seem to equally apply to white and black patients. This application will explore why we observe disparities in three common surgical specialties that are performed throughout most hospitals where surgery is practiced: general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery. The application will focus on a classic measure of surgical practice - the procedure time. While always available on chart review, the ability to study surgical procedure time on a vast scale with Medicare claims is new. Anesthesiologists began billing Medicare by the minute in 1994. Using these bills to estimate procedure length in a population of Pennsylvania patients, we have recently published that there was a significant and clinically important disparity in the length of operations based on race and income, after detailed adjustment for patient characteristics and procedure type. This disparity was greatest at hospitals with residency programs, where the procedure time of black patients in the lowest third of the income distribution was on average 31 minutes longer than that of white patients at the same level of income (P<0.0001). In non-resident hospitals the mean gap was 8 minutes (P<0.0001). In further work we have shown that the disparity in procedure length gets larger with longer procedure times (at the 95 percentile using quantile regression, the difference between blacks and whites is about 3 of an hour). Furthermore, in our examination of all teaching and non-teaching hospitals in the state of Pennsylvania, the 15 hospitals with the largest number of black patients undergoing orthopedic and general surgery, excess adjusted procedure time (black-white by hospital) was statistically significant in 5 of 15 hospitals, with their mean excess times ranging from 9 to 16 minutes. The strength of using operative time as a measure of disparity is that it reflects precisely what the surgical and anesthesia team have done, and is not confounded by patient compliance or preferences, as some other measures of process and outcome may be. This application aims: (1) To study and describe racial and income/SES disparity in procedure time across surgeons and hospitals; (2) To identify the determinants of disparity in procedure time across surgeons and hospitals. We will study those geographic, hospital, and surgeon characteristics associated with the greatest disparities in procedure time; and (3) To make practical recommendations to departments of surgery regarding procedure length and to create models to allow surgery departments to practically monitor such disparities in order to develop mechanisms to eliminate problems if found. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority Medicare patients undergoing surgery often have worse outcomes and longer procedure times than whites with comparable co-morbidities and procedures. This project aims to understand this disparity between minority and white Americans undergoing surgery through studying disparities in procedure time.          Project Narrative Minority Medicare patients undergoing surgery often have worse outcomes and longer procedure times than whites with comparable comorbidities and procedures.

"Role of English Fluency in Spanish Neuropsychological Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies primarily emanating from the cognitive science literature suggest both advantages and disadvantages of bilingualism for cognitive performance. The Interference Hypothesis suggests that while interacting in two languages (e.g., English and Spanish), bilinguals' capacity to communicate in one language decreases as a function of the second language interfering in their language-based cognitive processes. The Inhibitory Control Model, a refinement of this hypothesis, states that bilinguals must suppress the non-target language to allow production of the intended language. This constant experience with linguistic conflict resolution can be seen as practice of executive and attentional control, thus predicting a bilingual advantage on tasks requiring these abilities. While most of the work in bilingual neuro-cognition has been conducted using such cognitive science paradigms, often with college students, translation Into competent healthcare for linguistically diverse groups requires understanding how these performance predictions fit into an applied neuropsychology work frame, such as would be used when delivering care, and with a broader demographic representation. Given that Spanish speakers in the U.S. vary in English fluency, it is important to understand how this second language fluency affects neuropsychological (NP) performance in the first language. This has implications for the interpretation of test results when diagnosing brain dysfunction in bilingual patients. To this end, the proposed study will examine the effects of English fluency on Spanish language neuropsychological test performance hypothesizing relationships derived from existing cognitive science models. In addition, it will explore whether bilingual advantages observed in our preliminary data are explained by socioeconomic and acculturation differences between bilinguals and monolinguals. Finally, in order to understand the clinical significance of these potential performance differences, the proposed study will examine whether clinically meaningful bilingual advantages are observed in HIV+ individuals, a patient population in whom brain dysfunction is common. Participants will be 80 healthy HIV- men and women (40 bilingual and 40 demographically comparable monolingual), and 40 bilingual and 40 monolingual HIV+ participants with comparable demographic and disease characteristics. All will be native Spanish speakers of Mexican descent. Bilingualism will be determined based on a language preference questionnaire as well as objective measures of verbal fluency in each language. Participants will receive neuropsychological and psychosocial assessments. The knowledge gained will help to bridge health disparities in the competent neuropsychological assessment of diverse populations. My most direct goal will be to carry out the research plan proposed in this application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this type of research is to inform the development of valid ways to assess cognitive functioning in culturally and linguistically diverse populations. This will result in better quality of care across the spectrum of brain diseases, as such that caused by HIV. Understanding the ways in which socio-demographic characteristics impact cognition should ultimately, and ideally, not only affect the construction of assessment instruments but also point a direction in public policy toward maximizing the possibilities of an enriched developmental environment for people living under disadvantaged conditions. As a long-term goal Dr. Cherner and I would like to extend the already emerging international work of the   HNRC by setting up collaborations with other Latin American countries, to study the impact of neuro AIDS and associated conditions such as toxoplasmosis in different regions. My hope is that we can disseminate the knowledge obtained here in the U.S. Dr. to various countries in Latin America. Dr. Cherner, being a native of Argentina, and I, being a native of Colombia, make this goal a plausible one. It is my long term goal as a scientist and professor of a University in the United States that to one day I will be able to disseminate culturally appropriate assessment tools in developing countries were the need is great but resources are limited.          ",Role of English Fluency in Spanish Neuropsychological Performance,7754484,F31HD062163,"['Intelligence ', ' Ensure ', ' tongue apex ', '

"Biophysical Measure To Predict Pressure Ulcers In Nursing Home Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will test the validity of a non-visual assessment strategy for stage I pressure ulcers (PUs) among nursing home (NH) residents with light or dark skin tones using a multi-site, longitudinal cohort design. PUs are common, often preventable, and costly; detection of early-stage PUs is important because intervention may prevent decline to more severe PUs. The standard method of detection, visual skin assessment for non- blanchable erythema, is somewhat reliable for individuals with light skin tones but detects changes after skin damage has already occurred. In addition, visual skin assessment fails to detect skin color changes in persons with darkly pigmented skin. Documented health disparities between African Americans and Caucasians for incidence of stage I PUs and prevention intervention may be related to deficiencies in detection. In our prior studies, we showed that a hand-held device that assesses sub-epidermal moisture (SEM), a measure of edema from inflammatory changes in the tissues, identified stage I PUs. Further, SEM was higher (e.g., increased edema and inflammation) when there was no visible skin damage at the time but a stage I PU was visible on the skin one week later; SEM values predicted 26 percent of the subsequent stage I PUs. Findings were similar in a small sub-sample of NH residents with dark skin tones. We propose to test the validity of this innovative approach to detecting PUs, particularly focusing on residents with dark skin tones; to test threshold SEM values for detecting stage I PUs and detecting progression of stage I PUs to stage II+ PUs. We will recruit 389 NH residents, 62 of whom will have dark skin tones, who are at risk for PU based on the Minimum Data Set Assessment from 24 NHs. Visual skin assessments and blinded SEM measures will be completed by research staff at least weekly for consented residents for 4 months. Skin tone of NH residents will be assessed using color tiles rather than by proxy measures of ethnicity as in previous research. In addition, participant demographics, MDS assessment data on functional level, and comorbid medical conditions will be obtained from medical record review. Risk assessments using the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sores will be collected at baseline. Generalized ordered logistic modeling, appropriately modeling the repeated observations and time-dependent measures, will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of SEM measures to identify future skin damage. Measurement of SEM represents a potentially important tool for decreasing the disparity of prevention interventions between persons with different skin tones. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement to Public Health This project is the next step in the evaluation of a new assessment technique for bedsores, a common problem for nursing home residents. If this measurement can identify skin damage at an earlier stage to allow prompt intervention, evidence will be powerful for evaluating its use through a clinical trial. In addition, replacing methods of assessing skin damage that rely on skin color changes has the potential of reducing the severity of skin damage in persons with darkly pigmented skin, leading to reduction in observed health disparities and equalizing the chance of detecting damage at a point when prevention practices can be most effective.           Relevance Statement to Public Health This project is the next step in the evaluation of a new assessment technique for bedsores, a common problem for nursing home residents.

"Critical Care Excellence in Sepsis and Trauma (CREST)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic, 09-MD-101: Creating Transformational Approaches to Address Rural Health Disparities. A quasi-experimental clinical trial will test the effectiveness of the Critical Care Excellence in Sepsis and Trauma Program (CREST). The objective is to improve patient outcomes for sepsis and trauma by educating providers and providing access to specialist consultation via telemedicine technology to participating rural hospitals in the South Carolina (SC) Lowcountry and PeeDee regions. The Interstate-95 corridor transecting six SC counties is a predominantly rural area with a diverse patient population with limited health care resources. The healthcare and other disparities experienced by the 290,000 citizens of these counties are stark with 22% of the total population living below the federal poverty level, 4 of 6 being fully medically underserved, and 2 of 6 being partially medically underserved. Critical care and trauma care services and providers are in short supply. Without creative, alternative solutions to onsite intensivists and trauma specialists, rural hospitals will be unable to provide optimal care and patients with common critical conditions such as sepsis and trauma, will continue to pay a rural penalty of poorer outcomes. Substantial evidence supports reduced morbidity and mortality with intensivist- directed care for critically ill patients. Unfortunately, only 4% of US hospitals are estimated to meet this gold standard and over half have no intensivist coverage at all with rural hospitals being disproportionately affected. A major challenge is a national shortage of intensivists, trauma specialists, and other critical care staff, a problem likely to worsen as the population ages and demand for critical care increases. Furthermore, smaller hospitals often lack the economy of scale that makes a comprehensive critical care and trauma program feasible. Sepsis and trauma diagnoses represent over 1,700 visits annually to CREST hospitals' emergency departments and are leading causes for admission to an ICU. Nationally, sepsis is the 10th leading cause of death overall with increasing incidence as the population ages. Survival is directly related to appropriate initial evaluation and management in the first six critical hours. Trauma is the leading cause of death among Americans up to age 45 and the fourth leading cause for all ages. Trauma outcomes are directly related to management in the initial ""golden"" hour. Thus, both conditions represent high acuity, high stakes crises that provoke anxiety among non-specialist providers. Currently, rural Lowcountry patients suffering from these conditions do not have access to specialist directed care and are unlikely to acquire on-site access in the future. Via a public/private partnership using technological advances, CREST will test an economically efficient, creative, alternative solution to this dilemma. The care of patients with sepsis and trauma requires the delivery of appropriate, definitive care in the early stages of the illness. Hospitals with limited resources, including those in rural and underserved areas of the Low Country and Pee Dee regions of South Carolina, may be unable to consistently provide optimal care to these patients. In addition, the shortage of specialists nationally makes it more difficult for these hospitals to recruit and retain the specialists they need. Patients in these areas continue to pay the rural penalty of poorer outcomes. This proposal will provide specialist level care through telemedicine consults to rural emergency departments in the Low Country and Pee Dee regions of SC to improve outcomes for these patients.               Project Narrative The care of patients with sepsis and trauma requires the delivery of appropriate, definitive care in the early stages of the illness.

"Nursing Interventions to Reduce Disparities in Hospital Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an ARRA competitive revision of P30-NR005043 Center for Nursing Outcomes Research. We seek to extend the scope of the parent grant to create a new interdisciplinary collaboration with the Cartographic Modeling Laboratory (CML) and investigators in human geography and spatial analysis and to apply a novel approach, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, to nursing outcomes research focused on reducing racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes. Our work is motivated by recent research suggesting that features of hospitals, as contrasted with individual characteristics of patients, are important determinants of racial/ ethnic inequalities in outcomes of hospital care. We want to explore further, and with more complete data than has been available previously, the effects of socioeconomic status of individual patients on outcomes as well as the compositional effects of aggregations of sub-groups of patients by hospital. The latter addresses evidence that outcomes are worse for all patients in hospitals that care for a large proportion of minority patients. We will match the zip codes of the millions of patients in our 2005-06 database of 859 hospitals in 4 states with detailed information from CML on a variety of data about their neighborhoods, including income and education, and we will compute the distance from their home to the hospital where they received care. Likewise we will add to our comprehensive survey-based information on nurses who practice at these hospitals by deriving from their zip codes information including the travel time from their homes to their employing hospitals. Finally, we will enrich our information about hospitals with detailed information on their locations and market areas. The proposed study has the following aims: 1) to estimate patient characteristics not included in administrative databases (such as socioeconomic status and time traveled from home to hospital) in an effort to learn more about how previously unmeasured characteristics of patients and their communities impact outcomes of hospital care; 2) to determine hospital characteristics (beyond teaching status and size) that potentially contribute to disparities in outcomes including mapping the geographic distribution of nurses relative to hospital location, whether nurses travel longer to work at hospitals with good work environments, and socioeconomic conditions and market factors associated with hospital location; and 3) to integrate the new information derived from spatial analyses into predictive models of hospital outcomes developed previously by CNOR investigators to shed new light on to what extent targeted nursing resource interventions could be successful in reducing disparities.          ",Nursing Interventions to Reduce Disparities in Hospital Outcomes,7814598,P30NR005043,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Delaware ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Policy Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Faculty ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human Geography ', ' Area ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Joint Ventures ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Social Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' nursing intervention ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Manuscripts ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' economic impact ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Administrator ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Review Committee ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' parent grant ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2009,199997,0.09871067054926601
"Disparities in Incontinence and Perineal Skin Damage in Nursing Home Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a study of race, ethnic, and socioeconomic (SES) disparities as they relate to the development and management of incontinence, perineal dermatitis (PD), pressure ulcers (PUs) and associated quality of life in older nursing home (NH) residents. Reports of disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage and their management are a serious ethical and clinical concern warranting further investigation. Incontinence, PUs and PD are long-standing, widespread, and costly problems to which race, ethnic and SES disparities may contribute significantly. Annual treatment costs are in the billions of dollars, and each condition is significantly associated with psychological distress, physical discomfort, and lower quality of life. Complications of PUs can be fatal. Reducing health disparities offers a profound opportunity for improving the health of disadvantaged minority populations. Because health outcomes of NH residents and disparities in those outcomes are influenced by multiple factors at the individual, group NH, and community levels before and during a NH stay, investigation to detangle their contributions requires a multi-level approach. Previous studies have focused primarily on individual level resident characteristics or controlled for only a few NH factors; none has used a multi-level, multi-factoral approach. Because of our datasets, we are uniquely able to simultaneously measure factors at the individual, NH, and community levels that are associated with disparities in the development, prevention, and management of fecal and/or urinary incontinence, PD, PUs, and associated quality of life. We will analyze three large population datasets: Minimum Data Set (MDS) records and practitioner orders for all residents of a large, for-profit NH chain, the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) files, and the US Census tract data. In addition, we will compare disparities in these health conditions and management plans in residents of the proprietary set of NHs with those in a set of national for-profit and non-profit NHs using a fourth database of MDS records (without practitioner orders) and OSCAR, and Census data in a multi-level sensitivity analysis. In so doing, we will provide context to our findings and strengthen our ability to make more informed recommendations. Our study will provide the best evidence to date about which of the many possible modifiable factors associated with disparities in these outcomes should be targeted for intervention and ascertain the level of their contribution. Therefore, our findings are critical before interventions aimed at reducing disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage can be undertaken or successful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of differences in the involuntary leakage of urine and stool, associated skin damage, and quality of life that exist because of race, ethnic background, and social and economic status of older nursing home residents.

"Diagnostic Markers of Language Impairment in Bilinguals The estimated risk for language impairment (LI)in monolingual English speaking children is about 7%. A model for identifying language impairment, referredto as the EpiSLI system (Tomblin, Records, & Zhang, 1996), yields relatively high levels of specificity and sensitivity for identification of LI in kindergarten children from monolingual English speaking backgrounds. Systematic study is needed to determine a) the extent to which level of proficiency in English is related to risk for misidentification of language impairment, b) if the EpiSLI criteria can be applied to a new bilingual language test, c) to what extent testing (using a variety of assessment tasks) in English and the native language can be used to identify language impairment, and d) potential differences in the way bilingual learner's (language impaired vs. typical) performance on language measures changes with increased exposure to English. Due to the shortage of bilingual clinicians and the diversity of languages spoken in the US it would be helpful to determine the circumstances in which standardized testing, language learning measures, and/or processing measures administered in English can be used to reliably identify language impairment in bilingual children. We have planned a three phase study to address these issues. In phase 1,1500 Latino children will participate in language screening to determine the levels of risk across the bilingual population. In phase 2, a comparison of performance on standardized measures in Spanish and English will be administered to the at risk bilingual children identified in phase 1 to determine if the EpiSLI cut off values fold for bilinguals. Further, processing and learning measures will be administered in English to explore the extent to which such measures accurately predict language impairment at various levels of English proficiency.

"Center for Vulnerable Populations Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the Center for Vulnerable Populations Research (CVPR) is to enhance strengths of communities to eliminate health disparities faced by vulnerable populations (VPs), with a particular focus on ethnic/racial minorities and people living in poverty. The CVPR has facilitated sharing and expanding resources to improve the competence of investigators studying health problems of VPs, to support ongoing evolution of the knowledge base and methods of VP research, and to develop collaborative relations with community partners. Goals of the CVPR in the next five years are to: 1) continue expanding the scientific knowledge base of health-related problems of VPs to a) reduce/eliminate health disparities; b) facilitate health promotion; and c) improve outcomes of nursing practice; 2) translate the knowledge, skills, and experience acquired in participatory research (PR) methods and community partnerships by university and community investigators into practice/action to improve the health status of VPs and to develop science in this area; 3) expand capacity to measure, analyze and link biologic and behavioral markers in VPs research; and 4) disseminate research findings to inform community partners, and to influence nursing, health policy development, ethical decision- making processes, and future research. The infrastructure of the CVPR supports achievement of these goals through a variety of research and educational activities conducted by 4 cores - Administrative, Bio Laboratory, Participatory Research and Community Partnerships (PRCPC) and Research Support. Over the past four years the interdisciplinary team of CVPR investigators and affiliates have established several community partnerships and university collaborations and developed a unique scientific interface between behavioral and biologic researchers studying VPs. By involving research participants in the development and implementation of studies and directly disseminating the results of VP research to communities, clinicians and policy makers, the Center Investigators are effectively addressing important health and nursing issues. The community-based partnerships provide a solid foundation for further development of the CVPR as an epicenter for research and training in community-based PR to reduce health disparities. Current and planned CVPR research addresses elimination of health disparities in areas related to infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A/B/C, tuberculosis), chronic illness (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma) substance use, and environmental quality. Continuance of the CVPR will enable investigators to sustain and expand efforts to confront health disparities in Los Angeles and the nation, to address national health goals established by several governmental agencies, and to build community capacity.

"Racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals for coronary heart disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this K08 application is to support Dr loana Popescu to become an independent investigator in the area of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. The application will involve the assimilation of new methodological skills and the analysis of a number of existing health care databases. In support of the application, Dr. Popescu has assembled a team of experienced mentors-Drs. Gary Rosenthal (Department of Internal Medicine), Gerald Rushton (Geography), and Kevin Leicht (Sociology), who bring expertise in complementary methodological areas and who have assisted Dr. Popescu in designing integrated plans for career development and research. The Career Plan includes advanced training in: 1) hierarchical biostatistical modeling and clinical research ethics; 2) the application of spatial analysis and geographic information systems methods in health care; and 3) methods for measuring residential segregation and understanding its sociological roots. These goals will be accomplished through targeted coursework, tutorials, directed readings, and direct research experiences guided by her mentors. The Research Plan will examine the interplay between geography, segregation and health care system factors, in order to build a comprehensive understanding of why black patients are less likely to receive care for acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass surgery in high quality hospitals. The Research Plan includes three incremental aims that capitalize on a number of national data sources, including: Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims files; US Census data; American Hospital Association surveys; the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile; and Dartmouth Atlas health care market data. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between race, proximity to the admitting and to high quality hospitals, and the likelihood of admission to high quality hospitals. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of residential segregation on disparities in admissions to high quality hospitals. Aim 3 will examine the effects of patterns of prior outpatient care on disparities in admission to high quality hospitals and will build Dr. Popescu's fluency in analyzing more complex outpatient physician claims files.              ",Racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals for coronary heart disease,7641824,K08HL095930,"['Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Accounting ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Guidelines ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geography ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Inpatients ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rights ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Atlases ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' skills ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Bypass ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Assimilations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Accounting ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2009,127116,0.04249426073131852
"Diagnostic Markers of Language Impairment in Bilinguals The estimated risk for language impairment (LI)in monolingual English speaking children is about 7%. A model for identifying language impairment, referredto as the EpiSLI system (Tomblin, Records, & Zhang, 1996), yields relatively high levels of specificity and sensitivity for identification of LI in kindergarten children from monolingual English speaking backgrounds. Systematic study is needed to determine a) the extent to which level of proficiency in English is related to risk for misidentification of language impairment, b) if the EpiSLI criteria can be applied to a new bilingual language test, c) to what extent testing (using a variety of assessment tasks) in English and the native language can be used to identify language impairment, and d) potential differences in the way bilingual learner's (language impaired vs. typical) performance on language measures changes with increased exposure to English. Due to the shortage of bilingual clinicians and the diversity of languages spoken in the US it would be helpful to determine the circumstances in which standardized testing, language learning measures, and/or processing measures administered in English can be used to reliably identify language impairment in bilingual children. We have planned a three phase study to address these issues. In phase 1,1500 Latino children will participate in language screening to determine the levels of risk across the bilingual population. In phase 2, a comparison of performance on standardized measures in Spanish and English will be administered to the at risk bilingual children identified in phase 1 to determine if the EpiSLI cut off values fold for bilinguals. Further, processing and learning measures will be administered in English to explore the extent to which such measures accurately predict language impairment at various levels of English proficiency. In phase 3, children will participate in follow up testing evaluating language growth. Assessment of the persistance of language impairment across a 1 year period will help determine whether increase in English language skills affects classification accuracy of language impairment when measures are utilized in English.

"Variation in the Safety of Back Pain-Related Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09): Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic, 09-AG-101: Geographic Disparities in Medicare Usage. The proposed project will describe geographic disparities in quality of care of back surgery and examine hospital/surgeon characteristics associated with rates of repeat surgery higher than those in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT), the largest clinical trial ever funded by NIAMS (2,472 patients, 53 elite surgeons, 13 top hospitals in 11 states, and over $27 million in funding). SPORT provides Level 1 and Level 2 evidence for treatment of disc hernia ion, spinal stenos is, and degenerative spondylolisthesis; we propose to use it as the reference standard for comparing outcomes in back surgery. In SPORT, not only did patients have positive physical findings and correlated imaging findings, they also had a duration of associated symptoms (6-12 weeks plus) such that surgery would be a reasonable option. Furthermore, all patients experienced shared decision making (""Informed Choice""), wherein their values and preferences were recorded, a much higher standard of informed consent than is traditionally practiced. Outcomes for SPORT have been published in the most prestigious medical journals, with >5-year follow-up data accruing. Thus, we know how ""safe"" back surgery can be for common arthritis-related back disorders under the ideal conditions. Now we need to know if clinical practice meets these standards; and if not, why not? Patients seeking relief for severe back and leg symptoms are vulnerable not only to misperceptions about efficacy of some types of back surgery, but they may also underestimate the true risks versus desired benefits. Choice of surgery is an important, irreversible decision. For some types of surgery, reliable estimate of repeat surgery risk may be enough for patients to decide against the procedure. Regional variation in utilization of back surgery makes obvious lack of consensus on indications, but little is known about regional variation in terms of safety or the impact of this variation on decision-making. We know that despite good and appropriate indications some patients, when well informed, will decline surgical treatment. In SPORT several hundred patients, despite having very appropriate indications, declined surgical intervention and remained satisfied with their treatment decisions. We know surgeons may offer different types of back surgery to similar patients, and un-indicated or ineffective surgery is unlikely to relieve symptoms. Persistent back symptoms, in turn, may lead to additional surgery. To operate on a patient who, when well informed, would not chose to be operated on is, in fact, a SAFETY issue: it puts the patient at unnecessary risk. Repeat lumbar surgery is an undesirable safety outcome that surgeons and patients care about. We propose to use population-based rates of reoperation as a tool to study disparities in quality of care for back surgery. Using reoperation rates in SPORT as safety benchmarks for back surgery, we will determine which regional, hospital and/or surgeon factors are associated with reoperation rates higher than rates observed in SPORT. High rates of repeat surgery may point to ineffective initial surgery (labeled as ""overuse"" by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Roundtable on Health Care Quality) or potentially avoidable complications of surgery (labeled by IOM as ""misuse""). After adjusting for patient factors and surgical case-mix, repeat back surgery rates one or two standard deviations higher than SPORT rates may suggest problems with technical performance of surgery (""misuse"") or poor surgical indications (""overuse""). The National Quality Forum (NQF) has identified safety as a national priority, ""aiming for 'zero' harm wherever and whenever possible"", and it has recommended back surgery among its areas of focus for developing overuse measures. We propose population-based evaluation of repeat surgery rates in Medicare patients using validated methods for ascertaining lumbar surgery in administrative electronic health data. We will develop two indicators for measuring quality of care in back surgery: (1) ""Misuse"" we define as the 30-day or 1-year repeat lumbar surgery rate higher than the upper limit of SPORT 95% confidence intervals; and (2) ""Overuse"" we define as 4-year repeat surgery rate higher than the upper limit of the SPORT 95% confidence interval. We will rank de-identified individual hospitals and surgeons by reoperation rate and identify hospital/surgeon features associated with Misuse and Overuse. We also will describe geographic variation in back surgery Overuse across the 344 Dartmouth Atlas United States Hospital Referral Regions (HRR) and 3,300 Hospital Service Areas (HSA). The proposed work will refine electronic claims research methodology to allow ongoing back surgery safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness evaluations, and provide a necessary component of policy and payment reform strategies for making back surgery safer for all patients.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will compare differences in quality of care for back surgery across different hospitals and different surgeons by seeing how often a second operation is needed 30-days, 1-year, and 4-years after the initial operation as a quality indicator. The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, the largest ever back surgery study in which top surgeons and top hospitals performed surgery on carefully selected patients, sets the standard for how ""safe"" back surgery can be. We will see where back surgery safety falls short of the SPORT benchmarks, and which hospital factors and surgeon factors are associated with making back surgery less safe. This knowledge can help patients seeking surgical relief of arthritis-related back and leg symptoms make better choices on where to have surgery, and it can guide performance and incentive policies to make spinal surgery safer for all patients.               PulicHeathReevance We will compare differences in quality of care for back surgery across different hospitals and different surgeons by seeing how often a second operation is needed 30-days, 1-year, and 4-years after the initial operation as a quality indicator.

"Social Support, Self-Management, and Hospital Use for Heart Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly African Americans with heart failure are more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure compared to their white counterparts. However, African Americans with heart failure also frequently have similar or even lower 1- year mortality compared to white heart failure patients. Previous studies have shown that factors such as post-discharge care, the unique role of heart failure among African Americans, comorbidities, and access to care may account for the some of disparities in hospital use. However, fewer studies have examined non-clinical factors such as patient social support. Social support is essential to the successful outpatient management of heart failure, particularly among the elderly. Social support, provided by family or friends, may facilitate the adoption of and adherence to self-management behaviors such as checking daily weights and maintaining a low sodium diet. Social support may decrease heart failure morbidity through this mediating role in the relationship between self-management behaviors and hospital use for heart failure. The proposed research will include a prospective cohort study of African American and white adults over age 40 previously hospitalized for heart failure 1) to assess the relationship between social support and heart failure 2) to assess the relationship between self-management behaviors and hospital use for heart failure 3) to measure the extent to which social support mediates the relationship between self-management behavior and hospital use for heart failure. Study participants will be selected using administrative data on hospital discharges from a single large teaching hospital. At study entry, a survey instrument will be administered with validated scales to measure social support and self-management behaviors. In addition, other data on trust in physicians, comorbidities, functional status, medication use and adherence will be collected via the survey. At the end of the 1-year follow-up period, administrative hospital data will be used to measure hospital use for heart failure at the same teaching hospital for all study participants during the previous 12 months. In the data analysis, multivariable modeling will be used to examine the independent relationships of both social support and self- management behaviors with hospital use for heart failure in this diverse cohort. Furthermore, sequential model building will be utilized to determine if social support is a mediator in the relationship between self-management behaviors and hospital use for heart failure. The proposed research will help to elucidate the relationships among these patient factors and hospital use for heart failure. Additionally, the research should inform future work in the design of community-based interventions to augment or optimize social support in efforts to address racial disparities in hospital use for heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure affects about 2.6% of adults in the US and is the leading cause of hospitalizations annually among Medicare beneficiaries. Racial disparities in hospital use for heart failure reflect a higher burden of disease among elderly African Americans with heart failure compared to whites. The elucidation of the role of social support as it relates to self-management behaviors and hospital use for heart failure is essential to the creation and implementation of community-based interventions to address these health care disparities.           Heart failure affects about 2.6% of adults in the US and is the leading cause of hospitalizations annually among Medicare beneficiaries.

"Regionalization of elective total joint replacement    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     There is a strong relationship between hospital and surgeon volume and outcomes of total joint replacement. Therefore, regionalization, the movement of cases from low volume hospitals to high volume hospitals, of elective total joint replacements may be beneficial. The possible benefits of regionalization include improved patient outcomes and lower health care costs through a decreased rate of complications and revision surgery. However, the benefits of regionalization may not be equitably distributed if traditionally underserved patients face barriers to seeking regionalized care. Differential access to regionalized surgical care could possibly widen health disparities that already exist.      The aims of this research are: 1) to describe the frequency and predictors of regionalization of elective total joint replacement in the US; and 2) to assess whether regionalization for elective total joint replacement is associated with improved short-term patient outcomes. These aims will be accomplished by identifying the percentage of patients undergoing total joint replacements who traveled beyond their hospital service area (HSA) to undergo total joint replacement at a higher volume hospital in another HSA. Those who receive care in their local HSA will be considered ""localized"" while those who receive care elsewhere will be considered ""regionalized.""      Patients will be identified through existing hospital discharge databases for 21 states throughout the US. The effects of patient, age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status and comorbidity on the likelihood of receiving regionalized care will be evaluated using multivariable repeated measures models including methods that account for the correlation of procedures performed by the same surgeon or within the same hospital. To determine whether regionalization improves short-term outcomes, rates of surgical complication and revision procedures will be compared between patients who regionalize and those who do not, adjusting for potential confounders.      The results of this research will provide important insights regarding predictors and outcomes of regionalized orthopedic care. If regionalization is associated with reduced rates of surgical complications and revision procedures, and if regionalization is less common among traditionally underserved populations, then interventions to increase access to regionalized care may reduce disparities in outcomes of total joint replacement.          ",Regionalization of elective total joint replacement,7663112,R03AR054063,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Caring ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Surgical complication ', ' Knee ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Repeat Surgery ', ' Reoperation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Shoulder ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Atlases ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' cohort ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' ']",NIAMS,HOSPITAL FOR SPECIAL SURGERY,R03,2009,85750,0.03678303261656617
"The Caregiving Trajectory for Community-Dwelling Mexican-American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caregiving burden among Hispanic caregivers is a little understood and growing problem. As a result, research to address caregiver burden and prevent institutionalization in these populations is critical. It is estimated that there are over 42 million Hispanics in the U.S. and the cohort over age 65 is expected to grow faster than any other racial or ethnic group, tripling in number by 2050. Thirteen percent of Hispanic households currently provide care to an adult aged 50 or older whose life expectancy will increase to 87 years by 2050, surpassing all other ethnic groups. Given this dramatic shift in demographics, a burgeoning number of Hispanic families will be placed in a caregiving role. The purpose of this proposed study is to investigate the burden of caregiving in this at-risk population by describing the level, circumstances, and consequences of caregiver burden/strain, and determining the impact of cultural and contextual variables on caregiving and caregiver gain, along with factors that lead to nursing home admission. This proposed project is a longitudinal mixed methods descriptive study designed to intensively explore the natural course of caregiving, caregiving burden and strain, caregiver gain, and admission to nursing homes among Mexican-American families. One hundred ten caregiver-care recipient cases will be enrolled and followed for 15 months. Interviews and standardized questionnaires will be completed at baseline and every 10 weeks, with an additional measurement point if nursing home admission occurs. We will compare and contrast transitions and turning points in the caregiving trajectory (taking into account acculturation, the nature of the caregiver-care recipient relationship, gender, functional and cognitive status, and depression); identify factors that support caregiving; and determine what factors are most important in delaying institutionalization. The core component will be a case-oriented approach, that is, an intensive, qualitatively-driven, study of cases with an eye toward configurations of similarities and differences. A simultaneous, complementary, quantitatively-driven variable-oriented component will look for broad patterns across cases and enable the drawing of inferences based on these broad patterns. These approaches will be integrated throughout the analytic and interpretive phases of the study. This in-depth, systematic research into the caregiving trajectory should prove useful in designing interventions that are timed to occur simultaneously with known crisis points and help keep elders at home or to help families acknowledge when formal nursing home care should be sought. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using life course perspective, this longitudinal, descriptive, mixed methods study is designed to explore the natural course of caregiving, caregiving burden and strain, caregiver gain, and admission to nursing homes among 110 Mexican-American families.

"A VIDEO TO IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY DURING INTERPRETED-MEDICAL VISITS.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Everyday in the US, thousands among the 22+ million people with limited-English proficiency (LEP) have a medical visit. Federal law requires that LEP patients receive free language assistance services (e.g., interpreting) to prevent unequal care due to language barriers. However, poor language assistance for LEP patients is correlated with poor medical access, utilization, and outcomes. Because most medical providers do not speak all the foreign languages of their patients, interpreting is the most frequent type of language assistance. Today, the quality of medical interpreting is not assured, regulated, or otherwise monitored by any recognized authority. The interpreter could vary from a trained professional to the patient's own young child. Consequently, the probability of safe, quality care is uncertain for LEP patients during an interpreted-medical visit. Borrowing from an airline industry approach and social learning theory, this Phase I project will examine the effects of a prototype brief safety video to help LEP patients prevent and address common errors and dangers during interpreted-medical visits. Latino LEP patients are the focus of this Phase I due to the high and rapidly increasing representation in the US population. The video content will build on lessons from our prior projects to train and assess interpreting and cultural competency in healthcare, findings from the published literature, and from practice standards proposed by State and National interpreting associations. A small, randomized control study will be used to examine the differential effects of the video on patient knowledge and behaviors for a safer interpreted-medical visit. Two groups of 20 LEP Latinos with Type II diabetes will be randomized to a control or an intervention mock medical visit. One family medicine physician and one professional interpreter with prior experience in language access training will be trained to perform a standardized Type II diabetes follow-up visit with LEP participants. Mock visits will be designed to expose LEP participants to common interpreting challenges that lead to errors and unsafe care during interpreted-medical visits. Primary dependent variables will be patient actions to Planned and Unplanned Intepreting Challenges in the mock visit. Visits will be digitally video recorded with consent. Measurements will include systematic observations of the video content and a post-visit patient interview. Systematic documentation throughout development and pilot testing will assess factors related to video quality, feasibility of project implementation, and participant preferences. The degree of success in this project will determine a subsequent Phase I for significant refinements to the video approach or a Phase II project to rigorously examine the video in applied settings for commercialization. This work will assist healthcare organizations to improve patient safety, quality of care, and medical outcomes for LEP patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Substantial research in health disparities indicates that medical errors and unsafe care are higher among limited-English proficient people (now more than 22 million in the US). Despite federal, state and professional mandates requiring healthcare organizations to offer LEP patient language assistance and interpreting, the unmonitored and informal nature of current medical interpreting continues to lead to uncertain and unsafe patient care. This 6-month project will develop and pilot a prototype 4- to 5-minute patient safety video to help LEP patients identify, prevent, and address interpreting challenges so as to communicate accurately with their provider and ensure safe care.           Narrative Substantial research in health disparities indicates that medical errors and unsafe care are higher among limited-English proficient people (now more than 22 million in the US).

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Efficiency    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our original P01 grant application was motivated by the remarkable differences in health care intensity in the US. In this resubmission, we sharpen our focus in three ways. The goal is to understand and improve efficiency, the target is a more actionable level for physicians and the hospitals where they work, and the means include collaborations with key stakeholders to design successful interventions. The projects are: 1. Measuring the Efficiency of Health Care Providers. This project develops measures of efficiency - both quality and costs - and explores their implications at the level of primary care physicians, physician groups, and hospitals. We use Medicare data, patient and physician surveys, and specialty board certification scores from the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Family Practice. 2. Causes and Consequences of Variation in Pharmacotherapy Efficiency. We describe and model variation in prescription drug use using longitudinal claims data from very large insurance providers in two states, studying both consequences of variation in prescription drug use in outcomes and the impact of a large, systemic 'shock' - Medicare Part D - on existing treatment patterns and outcomes. 3. Technological Growth and the Efficiency of Health Care Diffusion. We study the contribution of ""high- tech"" health care to cost growth, the diffusion of different types of medical innovations, whether high-quality health providers affect population-level health outcomes, and how provider networks affect diffusion. 4. Geography and Disparities in Health and Health Care. We propose hospital-level disparity ""report cards,"" to study sorting of patients to disproportionately Black hospitals and to test whether the preferences of patients from a recent nation-wide survey of Medicare enrollees are reflected in their treatments. Finally, we estimate how racial differences in surgical rates affect disparities in actual health outcomes. 5. Norms Governing Physician Decision-Making For Critically III Elders. We use qualitative methods to describe the norms and values that influence the use of life-sustaining treatments among critically ill elders in emergency rooms and hospitals. We plan to test the feasibility of one or more interventions to change practice norms with the broader aim of improving efficiency. Cores: The Cores include an initiative to work with seven leading hospitals to address inefficiency in the provision of care, data support, and health efficiency measures for users of the Health and Retirement Study. Relevance: The project seeks to understand why efficiency is so poor in the U.S. health care system: 30% of health care spending is wasted, and quality of care is seriously lacking. We also explore several approaches to improving quality and reducing unwarranted variations in expenditures.

"Disparities in Post-Acute Rehabilitation Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad long-term objective of this research is to inform the development of interventions that will improve access to, use of, and quality of post-acute rehabilitation care for underserved populations. The primary objective of the proposed study is to gain a more thorough and current understanding of disparities in the use of post-acute rehabilitation care following hip fracture, joint replacement, and stroke. This study proposes to pool and analyze state-specific hospital discharge data from four geographically and demographically diverse states (AZ, FL, NJ, WI). The hospital discharge data will be merged with data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey database, the Area Resource File, and U.S. Census data. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable regression analyses for discrete outcomes, including multi-level analyses, will be conducted for each condition to achieve the following specific aims:       1) Describe the sociodemographic (race, ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic status) and geographic disparities (urban/rural, state) in the use of post-acute rehabilitation care. Through descriptive and bivariate analyses of the data, we will determine the extent to which use of post-acute rehabilitation care varies by each sociodemographic and geographic characteristic.       2) Determine the extent to which identified sociodemographic and geographic disparities are explained by other observed characteristics. Through a series of multivariable analyses examining individual and community-level characteristics associated with the use of post-acute rehabilitation care and through the use of decomposition techniques we will determine the extent to which the identified disparities are explained by other observed characteristics. More specifically, we will determine the extent to which the identified disparities are: a. confounded by other observed characteristics (e.g., insurance status and/or disease severity may explain some of the racial differences in use; marital status may explain some of the gender differences in use); b. moderated by other observed characteristics (e.g., disparities in use may differ for low income and high income minorities); c. explained by individual versus community-level characteristics (we hypothesize that both individual and community-level factors will explain differences in use); and d. unexplained by the characteristics examined in this study (we hypothesize that some of the identified differences in use will be unexplained). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Post-acute rehabilitation care is an effective and growing area of health care that has not been adequately investigated in regard to health care disparities. Identifying the extent to which disparities exist in post-acute rehabilitation care and determining underlying reasons for these disparities are necessary first steps in developing interventions to eliminate these disparities.             ",Disparities in Post-Acute Rehabilitation Care,7616084,R21HD057980,"['Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Belief ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Elderly woman ', ' American ', ' income insurance ', ' cohort ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Series ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Intermediate Care Facilities ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Marital Status ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Payment System ', ' Prospective Reimbursement ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2009,145407,-0.018854260418208514
"Impact of Nurse Work Environment on Rural Quality of Care and Clinical Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study addresses NINR's mission of eliminating health disparities due to geographic location. Rural hospitals are absent from existing studies that identify community factors (i.e. level of poverty) and organizational factors (i.e. the nurse work environment and hospital characteristics) that influence quality of care and clinical outcomes. In this proposed K01, structural contingency theory is used to conceptualize the association between the nurse work environment, rural community characteristics, hospital and nursing unit characteristics, quality of care, and clinical outcomes (Ml mortality). The goals of this proposed mentored research are to: a) develop a nurse assessed quality indicator and test this measure against established quality indicators (hospital collected, and large public data sets); b) evaluate the relationship between quality indicators and clinical outcomes in small rural hospitals; c) examine characteristics of the community, hospital, nursing unit, and nurse work environment that may influence quality of care indicators and Ml mortality in small rural hospitals. To accomplish this, the candidate will pursue a career development program, and will gain knowledge and proficiency in designing, developing, and using Web surveys; using large secondary public data bases; negotiating the special challenges that rural health research poses; and acquiring advanced knowledge of statistical methods and computer applications needed to do large scale studies using multilevel data. The candidate will be prepared to assume a lead role in planning and conducting complex rural nursing health studies. The training will be applied to the proposed study where small rural hospitals in two states will be invited to participate through their chief nursing officer. Data will be collected from multiple sources: Web-based staff nurse surveys, hospital administrative data, and large public data bases (i.e. Hospital Compare and state discharge data). The data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling and regression techniques. This study will form the basis for future research that includes an expansion of quality of care in the hospital to patient's quality of life after discharge.

"A multilevel approach to understanding healthcare disparities in the nursing home DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prior research indicates pervasive racial/ethnic disparities in quality of care among nursing home residents. This study proposes to examine how nursing home residents' race, nursing home segregation and residential segregation influence quality of care in nursing homes. The dissimilarity index will be used to measure nursing home and residential segregation. This index is the most widely use measure of segregation (Iceland, Weinberg, and Steinmetz, 2002). The objective of this study is understand factors that contribute to nursing home segregation, and also understand how various pathways may lead to disparities in quality of care. This study will 1) identify nursing home and market factors that may contribute to nursing home segregation, 2) examine how nursing home residents' race, nursing home segregation, and residential segregation independently influence quality of care, and 3) identify which level (resident, nursing home, or market) accounts for most of the differences observed in quality of care. The goal of this study is to move from documenting racial/ethnic disparities to understanding causal pathways that lead to racial/ethnic disparities. The sample will consist of Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes across the United States between the years of 1999 and 2004. Three data sets will be used in this study: On-Line Survey Certification of Automated Records (OSCAR), Medicare Cost Reports, and Area Resource File (ARF). OSCAR will be used to provide facility information about nursing homes. MDS+ will be used to provide information on individual characteristics. ARF will be used to obtain county level variables. The dependent variables will consist of nursing home segregation and quality outcomes (pressure ulcer, bowel decline, and activities of daily living). The primary independent variables of interest are nursing home residents' race, nursing home segregation and residential segregation. A hierarchical linear model will be conducted to examine the role of nursing home and market factors in relation to nursing home segregation. This model will be used because of the continuous nature of the dependent variable (nursing home segregation) and the hierarchical nature of the data. A generalized linear model will be conducted to examine how nursing home residents' race, nursing home segregation, and residential segregation influence quality. A generalized linear model is utilized due to the dichotomous nature of the quality variables. The intraclass coefficient (ICC) will be used to examine the variance among the three levels (resident, nursing home, and market). With an aging population that is becoming more diverse over time it is essential to understand factors that contribute to nursing home racial/ethnic disparities. While initiatives, such as Healthy People 2010, have been implemented to eliminate disparities, literature continues to provide ample evidence that racial/ethnic disparities are widespread throughout the healthcare setting.

"Amals: Addressing Mulitiple Aspects of Language Simultaneously: A Randomized Clin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to examine the efficacy of a manualized treatment intervention, AMALS: Addressing Multiple Aspects of Language Simultaneously, which is designed to remediate semantic, morphological, and syntactic aspects of language in preschool children with language impairment. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted comparing an integrated approach to treatment, AMALS, with an additive approach to therapy, Discrete Trial Approach (DTA). This study will target preschool children with language impairment living in a region characterized by nonmainstream dialects. It is expected children participating in AMALS treatment will exhibit greater semantic, morphological, and syntactic complexity on multiple outcome measures at the completion of the intervention compared to the DTA group, and that these gains will be maintained at one-month follow up. Language sample analysis will be used to measure changes in semantic, syntactic, and morphological abilities as well as classify dialect type and rate. Results will answer questions regarding treatment efficacy and the impact of dialect on variables of interest, specifically morphosyntactic abilities. This goal is critical because the vast majority of interventions for language impairment, including AMALS, have been tested using small-N and single case designs. Results from such studies, though informative and suggestive, require extensive replication to support treatment efficacy and generalizability. Although evidence suggests treatments such as AMALS hold great promise, it is now imperative that such treatments be evaluated using RCT in targeted populations. Further, children from diverse populations have been underrepresented in the literature due to methodological constraints. In this study, rather than restrict the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of this population, children's use of dialect will be uniquely identified and examined. Classifying dialect type and rate distinguishes this proposal from other RCTs targeting preschool children with language impairment. Examination of dialect type and rate will have significant implications regarding interpretation and generalization of findings, thus increasing the innovative nature of this study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Addressing needs in children with disabilities in regions speaking nonmainstream dialects meets a primary goal of Healthy People 2010, which is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population. Further this proposal meets focus area goal 6, which is to promote the health of people with disabilities, prevent secondary conditions, and eliminate disparities between people with and without disabilities. Addressing treatment efficacy in preschool children increases their health, increases their ability to perform within school communities, and prevents future difficulties.           Relevance Relevance to public health: Addressing needs in children with disabilities in regions speaking nonmainstream dialects meets a primary goal of Healthy People 2010, which is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population.

"Technological Home Care: Improving Caregiving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific aims of this study are to test the effects of a nursing intervention (FamTechCare) on family caregivers' problem solving ability, participation in health care management, health status, depression, quality of life, and health care services costs. Subjects in the study will be family caregivers (n= 80) and 80 adult patients dependent for survival on Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) infusions due to nonmalignant gastrointestinal disorders. Recruitment is through Kansas University Hospital and its rural outreach centers. Enrollment will be staggered over the project in order to assure adequate numbers and representative gender and racial distributions. Research methods include a placebo-controlled longitudinal clinical trial design with crossover and interventions delivered by videophone nurse visits, internet-based home care algorithm guides and by peer support. Peers are family caregivers with extensive HPN experience who will be trained to mentor dyads via videophone. These FamTechCare interventions are based on extensive preliminary data and include new, innovative extensions for this study. The entire intervention was pilot- tested and found feasible and not a burden. Questionnaires and laboratory data used to obtain pre- and post-intervention data are valid, sensitive to change and reliable and were completed in an average 20 minutes during pilot testing. Data analyses will include nested linear mixed model hypothesis testing to detect effects on caregiver/patient dyads. The novel concept of nurse caring conveyed via internet is also tested. Traditional cost analysis and the, innovative Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) will be used to describe each family's home care efficiency in relation to and health services costs. This study uses videophone and internet delivery which increases health care access and reduces health care disparities.

"Deaf People and Healthcare    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Steven Barnett MD is a family physician whose career has focused on healthcare with deaf people and families who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf people who communicate in ASL are a medically underserved and understudied vulnerable minority with much in common with other linguistic and socio cultural minority groups. Dr. Barnett's career goal is to be a leading expert and independent researcher on the topic of health and healthcare with deaf people and their families. The University of Rochester is an ideal place to work toward that goal, since Rochester has a large deaf population and the University of Rochester Medical Center is motivated to become a center of excellence on health promotion and disease prevention with people who are deaf. In order to achieve his goal, Dr. Barnett will pursue more advanced research training, including formal coursework in survey methods, epidemiology and sampling methods. He will also work with mentors, consultant and advisors to create individualized curricula focused on skills development in mixed quantitative and qualitative research methods, advanced ASL, and psychometrics, including issues related to translation and adaptation of English language tools for use with non-English populations. Dr. Barnett will work with his mentors, consultant and community advisory board to conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the healthcare experiences of deaf adult ASL-users. They will do this by translating and adapting the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) ambulatory care survey in order to collect information in ASL from deaf people about their healthcare experiences. They will administer CAHPS-ASL to four groups of deaf adult ASL-users in Rochester to learn about healthcare experiences in different settings. Dr. Barnett will bring the data and analyses back to his community advisory board and they will work together to plan future research and interventions to address the health and healthcare disparities experienced by deaf people and their families. CAHPS-ASL will be the first national survey adapted to learn about healthcare experiences from deaf adult ASL-users in their own language. Creating accessible research and addressing disparities are goals consistent with Healthy People 2010 objectives and essential to improve the quality and effectiveness of healthcare for this vulnerable population.           ",Deaf People and Healthcare,7669141,K08HS015700,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K08,2009,127061,0.029169048343253845
"A Partnership for Clinician EHR Use and Quality of Care The Institute for Nursing Centers and the Alliance of Chicago propose to study the effectiveness of a partnership that shares resources, and utilizes a data-driven approach to promote full clinician use of an EHR in three nurse managed health centers and three community health centers in order to improve the quality of care in areas of preventive care, chronic disease management, and medication management for vulnerable populations. These partners have a track record of highly productive research, successful EHR implementation, commitment to data-supported high quality health care for vulnerable populations, and a history of building and maintaining strong collaborations. The goals of this project address one of the key problems in leveraging health IT to support high quality patient care: the fact that despite the promise, clinical decision support is often not used effectively or consistently by clinicians even when an EHR is available. The research design incorporates quantitative and qualitative methods as well as individual and center level analyses. The critical link between full EHR use (including clinical decision support features) and clinical performance and quality outcomes will be examined with rigorous quantitative methodology. Quality indicators chosen are those that the Institute of Medicine has identified as priority areas for improvement, and are also in areas where significant disparities across race, ethnic, and income groups exist. Qualitative methodology will add to the field?s understanding of health center leadership and change management required for successful use of EHR.

"State variations in linguistic competency policies and the effects on immigrant a    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed dissertation study examines the effects of state language policies on the access to health services among immigrants-many of whom are limited English proficient (LEP) and likely to face language barriers. Under federal civil rights law, states are required to ensure that their health systems are accessible to LEP persons. However, due to the lack of oversight and enforcement, a broad ""patchwork"" of state policies has emerged. In the literature, efforts have been made to describe and catalogue the broad array of state policies as well as to highlight state models, such as California or Washington. However, whether these state policies are effective in improving access to health services among the immigrant population has not been empirically tested and thus, is still not clearly understood. Past studies examining the effectiveness of language service interventions have been largely based in a single setting (such as a hospital or clinic) and do not account for state variation. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Examine the changes in demographic characteristics for states with differing language policies; (2) Determine whether the disparities in access to health services between the immigrant and US-born populations vary from state to state; (3) Determine whether the disparities in access to health services between the immigrant and US-born populations vary between states with and without specific language policies; and (4) Evaluate the effectiveness of specific state language policies in addressing the disparities in access between immigrants and US-born persons. Three types of state language policies will be assessed, including: funding or reimbursement for language services, efforts to ensure health interpreter competency, and requirements for hospitals or other health care provider organizations. To achieve these aims, this study will draw on a secondary data source, the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF)-a large representative survey of families conducted by the Urban Institute. Unlike other national surveys, the NSAF is designed to provide state-specific estimates and allows for comparisons between a cross-section of thirteen states. To account for the hierarchical nature of the data (i.e. individual nested in states), multi-level modeling will be used to test differences in immigrant access to health services in states with these language policies versus states without such policies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance and Impact This study evaluates the effectiveness of state language policies in improving access to health services for immigrant populations. States play an important role in the provision of health services, but face tremendous challenges in addressing the healthcare needs of their growing immigrant constituencies-many of whom have problems speaking or understanding the English language. Currently, there is considerable state variation in the policies dealing with language barriers in the health system and little empirical knowledge as to whether these policies work.           Relevance and Impact This study evaluates the effectiveness of state language policies in improving access to health services for immigrant populations.

"Computational and Behavioral Evidence for Bilingual Aphasia Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population. Diagnosis and treatment of bilingual aphasia is one area where disparities continue to exist even though this topic is of great importance in an increasingly bilingual world. The current research on this topic, however, lacks specific recommendations on which languages should be trained in a bilingual aphasic individual and to what extent cross-language transfer occurs subsequent to rehabilitation. Factors contributing to the paucity of research in this area relate to the multitude of possible language combinations in a bilingual individual, the relative competency of the two languages of the bilingual individual and the effect of focal brain damage on bilingual language representation. It is, however, unfeasible to examine these issues without undertaking a large scale longitudinal study in this population. As a potential solution, the proposed project will systematically examine the extent of cross-language transfer subsequent to rehabilitation using a computational model. This model will be developed to simulate a bilingual language system in which language representations can vary by age of acquisition and relative proficiency, and will be subsequently lesioned and retrained to improve output. The training will be provided in one language and the extent of cross-language transfer will be examined. It is predicted that age of acquisition, the level of pre-morbid language proficiency and post-morbid language performance will influence the nature and degree of cross-language transfer. Further, the model's power to predict the optimal language to be treated will be compared to data obtained from behavioral interventions from a sample of patients with bilingual aphasia. The proposed work is innovative, because it uses a computational model to predict optimal rehabilitation protocols to facilitate the greatest amount of language recovery in bilingual aphasia. The successful completion of this project is expected to have an important impact on rehabilitation of stroke and bilingual aphasia as well as on the applications of computational modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project is relevant because it will address the important issue of language recovery following treatment in bilingual aphasic individuals by comparing performance in treated bilingual aphasic individuals with the performance of a computational model simulating aphasia in a bilingual lexicon. Establishment of the efficacy of rehabilitation in each of the languages of the bilingual aphasic individual is important because there are currently no clear recommendations on the best approach for rehabilitation of bilingual aphasia.           This project is relevant because it will address the important issue of language recovery following treatment in bilingual aphasic individuals by comparing performance in treated bilingual aphasic individuals with the performance of a computational model simulating aphasia in a bilingual lexicon.

"University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  To improve our overall academic environment, the RISE program was initiated in 1998 to prepare students to become scientists. As part of this long-term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in three areas: (1) their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, (2) their limited research skills and experience, and (3) limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, four developmental activities are prescribed--visiting scientists, research skills, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators both at UPR Cayey and at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 40 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the U.S. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: (1) research and language skills with on-campus faculty mentors, (2) motivational visiting scientists, and (3) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the U.S. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPR Cayey alumni who will be biomedical research scientists.      During the last 8 years, 20 MBRS alumni completed Ph.D.s and 40 alumni began their Ph.D. studies. By doubling the number of alumni entering doctoral programs, RISE will impact the community. These UPR Cayey scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases.          ",University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program,7619990,R25GM059429,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' publication formats ', ' Comprehension ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Internships ', ' Island ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' English Language ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Oral ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' Bibliography ', ' Visit ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PR CAYEY UNIVERSITY COLL,R25,2009,435308,0.0025883704558276825
"Tense and Agreement in SAAE and SWE by Dialect Density and SLI Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the work is to examine the tense and agreement systems of children with and without specific language impairment (SLI) in Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). Although strides have been made in the study of SLI in SAAE and SWE, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of these dialects, and of the manifestations of SLI within them. These gaps in the literature create barriers to the representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this impedes the development of valid and efficient clinical services for children who speak these dialects. The focus of the work is on tense and agreement because recent findings from our lab and others indicate that nonstandard English-speaking children with SLI present difficulties with this aspect of language when compared to same dialect-speaking controls. These findings are consistent with two linguistic theories of SLI, the Extended Optional Infinitive account (EOI; Rice & Wexler, 1996; Rice, Wexler & Cleave, 1995) and the Feature-based Limited Functional Category account (F-LFC; Hegarty, 2005). Within the proposed work, we will further evaluate and specify the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE and complete four tests of the EOI and F-LFC models. The four tests involve: 1) the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE; 2) the nature of the tense and agreement systems of typically developing children who vary in their nonstandard dialect use; 3) the relation between measures of children's tense and agreement systems and their general language ability, cognition, and environment; and 4) the relation between children's overt marking of tense and agreement and their overt marking of other functional categories (negation, complementizers) within an utterance. For the first three tests, the models make similar predictions but for the fourth, the models make different predictions. To achieve these goals, we will complete one large-scale study of 240 children in eight participant groups. These groups will allow us to compare same-dialect speaking children with and without SLI to each other (Test 1); evaluate differences between groups of typically developing children who produce low, medium, and high densities of SAAE and SWE (Test 2); complete regression analyses (Test 3); and complete a functional category analysis of utterances that contain tense and agreement, negation, and complementizers (Test 4). The data will come from language samples, standardized testing, and experimental probes as has been done in studies of standard English. However, to adequately evaluate the children's language systems and test the predictions of the EOI and F-LFC models within SAAE and SWE, we will create dialect-appropriate stimuli and dialect-appropriate coding systems. Findings from the work will lead to improved clinical services for children and a reduction of the health disparities that exist in the rural Deep South and elsewhere. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South. The proposed studies seek to learn more about children within these communities by focusing on the grammatical profile of SLI within Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). The findings should lead to a better understanding of the SLI grammar profile within these dialects while also providing four tests of two linguistic models of SLI. These findings should result in greater representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this should lead to improved clinical services and a reduction of health disparities for children who live in the rural Deep South and elsewhere.           Health Impact Statement  Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South.

"Heart Failure Clinical Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The proposed Heart Failure Regional Clinical Center (HF-RCC) application provides a unique opportunity to access practicing physicians as well as rural and minority outreach to support heart failure research and education. The network is an academic - community physicians partnership pioneered by the Morehouse School of Medicine Community Physicians' Network (CRN), to promote clinical research and practice based quality improvement. The network allows seamless integration of NIH supported clinical protocols at the community practice level. The HF RCC builds up on this model by bringing together the largest Cardiology group practice, in North Atlanta, known in the southeast USA for leading edge practice and research with 2 of the largest and oldest minority owned Cardiology practices in the South Metro Atlanta and surrounding rural communities. The extraordinary geographic reach of the network, its socioeconomic and ethnic diversity is evident from the Heart Failure Registry database, a summary of which is included with this application. Finally, the affiliations with St. Joseph's Hospital and Grady Hospital, large tertiary care centers, respectively known nationally for award winning cardiovascular care and outstanding care delivery to the underserved, provide unprecedented opportunity and credibility to impact cardiovascular care and health disparities. The longstanding mission of MSM to promote equitable care for all is the ultimate engine and passion that drives the network. Indeed participating practices and hospitals have cited this commitment as a key motivator for their interest in the Community Physicians' Network. We have proposed an infrastructure based on our experience and expertise in recruiting and retaining difficult to reach patient populations. The two projects provide an opportunity to fully exploit the intellectual and infrastructure capacity of the Network. Both projects capitalize on the size of the Heart Failure patient population in our RCC, as well as expertise of investigators. Project one draws upon our research interest in remodeling in hypertensive heart disease and heart failure, and also takes advantage of our group's interest in the role of   NO in cardiac and vascular remodeling. The second project is largely based on the expertise of our   collaborator, Nicholas Chronos, MD in cell based therapies in preclinical and early phase clinical trials. The proposed clinical skills development core integrates existing clinical training resource such as the   successful Master of Science in Clinical Research Program at MSM and the sought after cardiovascular   research training program at St. Joseph's Research Institute. In summary, we have proposed a very unique application which should serve as a model for future collaborative research networks that seek to actively engage and integrate community practices, a key stated goals of the NIH to map initiative.

"Diagnostic Markers of Language Impairment in Bilinguals The estimated risk for language impairment (LI)in monolingual English speaking children is about 7%. A model for identifying language impairment, referredto as the EpiSLI system (Tomblin, Records, & Zhang, 1996), yields relatively high levels of specificity and sensitivity for identification of LI in kindergarten children from monolingual English speaking backgrounds. Systematic study is needed to determine a) the extent to which level of proficiency in English is related to risk for misidentification of language impairment, b) if the EpiSLI criteria can be applied to a new bilingual language test, c) to what extent testing (using a variety of assessment tasks) in English and the native language can be used to identify language impairment, and d) potential differences in the way bilingual learner's (language impaired vs. typical) performance on language measures changes with increased exposure to English. Due to the shortage of bilingual clinicians and the diversity of languages spoken in the US it would be helpful to determine the circumstances in which standardized testing, language learning measures, and/or processing measures administered in English can be used to reliably identify language impairment in bilingual children. We have planned a three phase study to address these issues. In phase 1,1500 Latino children will participate in language screening to determine the levels of risk across the bilingual population. In phase 2, a comparison of performance on standardized measures in Spanish and English will be administered to the at risk bilingual children identified in phase 1 to determine if the EpiSLI cut off values fold for bilinguals. Further, processing and learning measures will be administered in English to explore the extent to which such measures accurately predict language impairment at various levels of English proficiency. In phase 3, children will participate in follow up testing evaluating language growth. Assessment of the persistance of language impairment across a 1 year period will help determine whether increase in English language skills affects classification accuracy of language impairment when measures are utilized in English.

"Educational Television Program for Children of Immigrant Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The language barrier between immigrant parents and their English-dominant children is a pervasive and relatively unrecognized problem in an estimated 12 million U.S. households. This intergenerational language gap often leads to adverse health outcomes for both children and adults for the following reasons: (1) it hinders young children's ability to communicate with their parents when they feel sick; and (2) as children are inevitably relied upon as interpreters for family members during office visits and medical emergencies, they are ill-prepared both linguistically and mentally for such a difficult task.  This project seeks to develop a television program that can bridge the intergenerational language gap and improve the health status of all members of an immigrant household. During our Phase I study, we developed a pilot episode and successfully demonstrated that it was an effective tool for achieving both of the stated educational goals.

"Disparties in Nursing Home Care by Race and Payer Status DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate, a recently graduated health economist, with additional training and research experience that will enable him to pursue an academic career in aging with a focus on the economics of nursing home quality care issues. In order to fully understand and investigate patient-level quality measures, the candidate will need to acquire specialized knowledge and skills. He proposes a career development plan with a mentoring team of senior faculty that will provide clinical, measurement, and modeling expertise in the use of patient-level data. The research program consists of a study of within-facility variation in the quality of nursing home care. The first aim of this study tests whether disparities in nursing home care and nursing home outcomes exist across Medicaid and private-pay residents within a common facility. The second aim of this study evaluates whether disparities in nursing home care and nursing home outcomes exist across racial and ethnic minority and majority residents within a common facility. By using recent MDS data over multiple years, the proposed study will greatly increase our understanding of differences in nursing home quality by payer status and race. The results will allow providers, advocates, clinicians, consumers and policymakers to better evaluate and address within-facility disparities in nursing home care.

"Safety Net Hospitals and Minority Access to Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Safety net hospitals play a critical role in the US health system providing access to health services for vulnerable populations, especially low-income racial and ethnic minorities. However, these hospitals have faced increasing strain over the last decade due to public and private payment pressures, growing demand for indigent care, and the growing concentration of this care in fewer institutions. Given this, the closure or ownership conversion of even a few safety net hospitals could have major effects on communities whose residents depend on these institutions. Although several studies have examined the hospital safety net and others have examined health disparities among racial and ethnic minority groups, little research has linked these two areas. The National Institute of Health's PA-05-006 identified this research as a priority because institutional policies, such as hospital closure or conversion, could affect the accessible supply of racial and ethnic minority health care providers and thus exacerbate racial and ethnic disparities in access to care, health status, and outcomes. Our proposed analysis examines how patterns of access are affected by safety net hospital contraction, examining its effects on minority and non-minority individuals living in low- income areas. We develop multiple measures of accessibility, accounting for a variety of place-specific factors not typically used in health services research, such as a multivariate factor reflecting physical/geographical impedance and measures of acculturation and residential segregation. We use these accessibility measures to identify communities with the greatest access impediments following safety net hosptial closure or conversion. We then undertake case study research to assess which groups of individuals, as distinguished by socioeconomic factors, were most affected when access to safety net resources declined in their communities and what policy interventions may have limited or exacerbated these detrimental effects. Our research is important given continued budget problems in several states and the federal govemement. In relation to the latter, 2005 legislative action reduced Medicaid spending by $10 billion between 2007 and 2010 and the 2007 Bush Administration budget application called for an additional $35 billion cut over a ten- year period. Such large reductions in Medicaid support could push more safety net hospitals to close or convert ownership. It is important for policy makers, the public, and the health industry to know what this might mean for access to care if the loss of financial support results in further safety net contraction.           ",Safety Net Hospitals and Minority Access to Health Care,7597125,R01HL082707,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Medical Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Emergency Care ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Financial Support ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' minority health ', ' Hospital Closures ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Indigent Care ', ' Indigent ', ' Industry ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Masks ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' pressure ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Private Hospitals ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' Budgets ', ' Burn Units ', ' payment ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' County ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Hospital safety ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NHLBI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,355175,-0.02474304482560589
"Understanding Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Outcomes of Medicare Home Health C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reports have highlighted the significant cuts in Medicare home health benefits recently. Racial/ethnic minorities have been especially affected. Studies have provided some initial, but inconclusive, evidence that these decreases in service are having a larger impact on home health outcomes for minorities. Limitations in prior research, prevent us from determining whether and to what extent race is a critical factor in home health outcomes. Understanding racial/ethnic disparities in the home health system is essential for advancing the overall health of the Medicare population. By improving the health care and status of minority patients we stand to greatly improve the effectiveness of our healthcare system and reduce costs from morbidity and mortality. The goal of the study is to enhance understanding of the patient, agency, clinical practice, and system factors that contribute to racial disparities in home health as a first step toward alleviating disparities. The specific aims are to: examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and home health outcomes including health status and adverse events; explore the patient, agency, and system factors that mediate/moderate the relationship between race/ethnicity and home health outcomes; conduct qualitative interviews with home care agency staff to help interpret the quantitative findings, and explore the clinical practice factors that influence the relationship between race/ethnicity and outcomes. This mixed methods study will combine data from the Outcome Assessment Information Set (OASIS), Home Health Agency Standard Analytical File (HHASAF), Provider of Services (POS) file, census, and Area Resource File (ARF). By combining multiple data sets representing the entire population of Medicare home health users the study will analyze a comprehensive set of patient, clinical practice, agency, and system factors that may contribute to disparities; examine outcomes for more racial/ethnic groups than previous studies; enhance representativeness; better approximate the complex construct of health outcomes by examining its multiple dimensions; and have adequate power to examine multiple contributing factors with controls. Regression will be used to identify mediators and moderators. Change in health status between admission to home care and discharge will be measured via OASIS data items covering functional, physiologic, cognitive and behavioral dimensions of health. Adverse events such as emergency care, hospitalization, or discharge with care needs occurring during the home care episode will also be analyzed. The quantitative analysis will also be used to identify high and low performing agencies by race on outcomes for the qualitative interviews. Qualitative interviews with home health agency staff around the nation will be used to interpret the findings of the quantitative work and to more deeply explore clinical practice factors which contribute to disparities in home care. This sequential mixed methods study will enable critical evaluation of the impact of race on home health outcomes and agency staff views on what patient, clinical practice, agency, and system interventions would be most appropriate to implement change. Public Health Relevance: Health disparities are a critical public health concern for 2 reasons: 1) they are indicative of an underlying inequality in our health care system; and 2) they result in poorer outcomes for minority and other vulnerable populations. Our focus on how disparities occur in Medicare home health care, emphasizes factors amenable to change thereby enabling us to develop specific interventions to reduce such disparities. The elimination of racial/ethnic health disparities holds the greatest promise to improve the overall health status of our society, while at the same time directly benefiting vulnerable populations.                 Project Narrative Health disparities are a critical public health concern for 2 reasons: 1) they are indicative of an underlying inequality in our health care system; and 2) they result in poorer outcomes for minority and other vulnerable populations.

"Nursing Impact on Care Outcomes for Chronically Ill and Minority Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nursing Impact on Care Outcomes for Chronically Ill and Minority Patients This revised competing continuation (R01NR04513) extends a highly successful program of research that has influenced changes in practice and policy, and stimulated global interest in nursing outcomes research. We extend our work on the significant association between preventable hospitals deaths and the organizational context of nursing care into new domains of theoretical relevance and substantive interest, new patient populations, and new outcomes. We have documented in our current work significant increases in chronic health conditions among people seeking hospital care for acute medical illnesses such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute congestive heart failure, and for general surgery, reflecting changes in population health. We will determine whether nursing factors are particularly important for preventing adverse outcomes during hospitalization for these at-risk patients. Our greatest interest is in three conditions that are increasing significantly among hospitalized patients and have important implications for nursing care: obesity, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary disease. We look not only at the outcomes for individual patients with these underlying chronic conditions. We also examine whether the outcomes for patients without chronic conditions are poorer in hospitals with higher concentrations of patients with these particular chronic conditions. All else being equal, we expect that non-chronic patients in hospitals with high concentrations of chronic patients may not benefit as much from better nurse staffing and care environments as similar patients in hospitals with lower concentrations of chronic patients because nurses in the former hospitals devote relatively more attention to those at risk of poor outcomes but are not likely to be better staffed. Similarly, we turn our attention to racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes to test whether poorer outcomes for minorities are explained by a combination of multiple underlying chronic health conditions and the concentration of minorities in hospitals with poor nurse staffing and education and less satisfactory care environments. Surprisingly the large literature on health disparities rarely considers how nursing might be a factor that explains poor outcomes, which is a necessary step to understanding whether improving nurse staffing and care environments is likely to contribute to reducing disparities in hospital outcomes. The findings have implications for nurse staffing standards and hospital payment, particularly for minority-serving hospitals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in population health, including sharp increases in chronic conditions, contribute to the complexity of hospital care and increase the risk for poor outcomes. Disparities in hospital outcomes by race and ethnicity persist. This study examines whether improving nursing resources in hospitals would be a potentially effective strategy to improve outcomes in these overlapping populations.             Changes in population health, including sharp increases in chronic conditions, contribute to the complexity of  hospital care and increase the risk for poor outcomes.

"Disparities in Incontinence and Perineal Skin Damage in Nursing Home Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a study of race, ethnic, and socioeconomic (SES) disparities as they relate to the development and management of incontinence, perineal dermatitis (PD), pressure ulcers (PUs) and associated quality of life in older nursing home (NH) residents. Reports of disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage and their management are a serious ethical and clinical concern warranting further investigation. Incontinence, PUs and PD are long-standing, widespread, and costly problems to which race, ethnic and SES disparities may contribute significantly. Annual treatment costs are in the billions of dollars, and each condition is significantly associated with psychological distress, physical discomfort, and lower quality of life. Complications of PUs can be fatal. Reducing health disparities offers a profound opportunity for improving the health of disadvantaged minority populations. Because health outcomes of NH residents and disparities in those outcomes are influenced by multiple factors at the individual, group NH, and community levels before and during a NH stay, investigation to detangle their contributions requires a multi-level approach. Previous studies have focused primarily on individual level resident characteristics or controlled for only a few NH factors; none has used a multi-level, multi-factoral approach. Because of our datasets, we are uniquely able to simultaneously measure factors at the individual, NH, and community levels that are associated with disparities in the development, prevention, and management of fecal and/or urinary incontinence, PD, PUs, and associated quality of life. We will analyze three large population datasets: Minimum Data Set (MDS) records and practitioner orders for all residents of a large, for-profit NH chain, the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) files, and the US Census tract data. In addition, we will compare disparities in these health conditions and management plans in residents of the proprietary set of NHs with those in a set of national for-profit and non-profit NHs using a fourth database of MDS records (without practitioner orders) and OSCAR, and Census data in a multi-level sensitivity analysis. In so doing, we will provide context to our findings and strengthen our ability to make more informed recommendations. Our study will provide the best evidence to date about which of the many possible modifiable factors associated with disparities in these outcomes should be targeted for intervention and ascertain the level of their contribution. Therefore, our findings are critical before interventions aimed at reducing disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage can be undertaken or successful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of differences in the involuntary leakage of urine and stool, associated skin damage, and quality of life that exist because of race, ethnic background, and social and economic status of older nursing home residents. This study will also examine nursing home and community factors that may play a role in the occurrence, prevention, and management of these health problems that greatly reduce physical and psychological well-being.                    This is a study of differences in the involuntary leakage of urine and stool, associated skin damage, and quality of life that exist because of race, ethnic background, and social and economic status of older nursing home residents.

"Cross-Language Outcomes of Bilingual Experience in Typical and Atypical Developme    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population. Identification of language impairment (SLI) and careful description of its trajectory during the school-age years is one area where disparities continue to exist. One population that is currently understudied is the Spanish-English bilingual school population. Significant strides have been made in the identification of markers of language impairment in young bilingual (Spanish-English) children. There are emerging strategies and instruments that guide identification of true impairment vs. language differences in this population (e.g., Gutiirrez-Clellen, Restrepo, & Simon-Cereijido, 2006; Gutiirrez-Clellen & Simon-Cereijido, 2007). There is also more detail about the kinds of language changes that bilingual children make in their two languages as they transition from the home to the school language (Hammer, Lawrence, & Miccio, 2008). A number of studies examine reading outcomes in bilingual children as well. However, there is a lack of systematic longitudinal studies examining the consequences of SLI in bilingual children. Spanish speakers are the largest language minority in the US and they make up 79 percent of the school age limited English speaking population. During the school age years children need to move quickly from basic conversational skills in English to development of academic language skills. Yet, during the early second language acquisition, performance in each language is highly variable, demonstrated by inconsistent levels of fluency across each language (Bialystok, 2001). ELL children with SLI are at higher risk for low educational and linguistic outcomes. The higher risk comes from at least two major sources: (1) lack of English proficiency that limits academic access; and (2) their language impairment that puts them at-risk for other academic difficulties. We propose to examine developmental outcomes in three domains (phonology/phonotactics, vocabulary/semantics, morphosyntax) in bilingual children at three ability levels (SLI, typical developing-at risk, typically developing). This project has two main phases. In phase 1 we focus on risk for language impairment as a function of Spanish/English exposure and use patterns across three grades (preschool, first grade, and third). In phase 2 a multiple longitudinal design will be employed that will include 4 overlapping cohorts to span the preschool through 5th grade age range. We incorporate processing tasks tied to each domain designed to tap into children's ability to alter processing with experience (i.e., short term learning). Here, we focus on learning trajectories for bilingual children with and without SLI. The results will provide a unique perspective on the linking of development across domains (e.g., phonological skills supporting acquisition of morphosyntactic forms), within and across a bilingual child's languages, as well as how development is modulated by language exposure, impairment, and variations in production processes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population.

"New Mexico Race and Ethnicity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New Mexico Department of Health and the Health Policy Commission will improve the quality of race and ethnicity data in hospital discharge and emergency department databases in New Mexico. In addition, the project will collect tribal identifier data and establish methods and procedures for tribal identifiers as a model for other states. The New Mexico administrative code will be revised to require that hospitals report race and ethnicity data, consistent with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standard, and tribal identifier data to the State. Under the guidance of a state advisory committee, 5   10 pilot hospitals will field test the training materials that will be developed for the project. These will include hospital procedure, data collection, patient education and train-the-trainer materials. Once the pilot hospitals have begun reporting race and ethnicity data from hospitalizations successfully using these new methods, reporting will be expanded to all other non-federal hospitals. And once hospitalization race, ethnicity and tribal identifier reporting is well underway, reporting of race, ethnicity and tribal identifier will commence from emergency departments. Hospital specific compliance plans will be developed and modified to assure improvements in each hospital's data. Evaluation of this new approach in New Mexico will be focused on several complementary methods. Chart reviews at pilot hospitals will help determine if the new approach to race, ethnicity, and tribal identifier reporting has been adequately implemented. If not, procedures will be revised as necessary. Linkage of electronic hospital discharge records with birth certificate records and Indian Health Service records periodically will track improvements in the reliability of race, ethnicity and tribal identifier data. And phone calls to hospitalized persons following discharge to compare their race, ethnicity and tribal identifier by self-report with hospital records will track improvements in the validity of these data. Dissemination of these new methods to other states will be critical to the success of the project. New Mexico expects to have established a model for the collection, reporting and appropriate dissemination of tribal identifier data included in hospital data which will be disseminated to other states informally and through a published manuscript. The field tested data collection materials, patient education materials and training modules developed by the project will also be disseminated to other states.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New Mexico's Improving the Quality of Race and Ethnicity Data Project is relevant to public health because it will improve the reliability and validity of race, ethnicity and tribal affiliation hospital data in New Mexico and, through dissemination of methods and materials, in other states.

"Critical Care Excellence in Sepsis and Trauma (CREST)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic, 09-MD-101: Creating Transformational Approaches to Address Rural Health Disparities. A quasi-experimental clinical trial will test the effectiveness of the Critical Care Excellence in Sepsis and Trauma Program (CREST). The objective is to improve patient outcomes for sepsis and trauma by educating providers and providing access to specialist consultation via telemedicine technology to participating rural hospitals in the South Carolina (SC) Lowcountry and PeeDee regions. The Interstate-95 corridor transecting six SC counties is a predominantly rural area with a diverse patient population with limited health care resources. The healthcare and other disparities experienced by the 290,000 citizens of these counties are stark with 22% of the total population living below the federal poverty level, 4 of 6 being fully medically underserved, and 2 of 6 being partially medically underserved. Critical care and trauma care services and providers are in short supply. Without creative, alternative solutions to onsite intensivists and trauma specialists, rural hospitals will be unable to provide optimal care and patients with common critical conditions such as sepsis and trauma, will continue to pay a rural penalty of poorer outcomes. Substantial evidence supports reduced morbidity and mortality with intensivist- directed care for critically ill patients. Unfortunately, only 4% of US hospitals are estimated to meet this gold standard and over half have no intensivist coverage at all with rural hospitals being disproportionately affected. A major challenge is a national shortage of intensivists, trauma specialists, and other critical care staff, a problem likely to worsen as the population ages and demand for critical care increases. Furthermore, smaller hospitals often lack the economy of scale that makes a comprehensive critical care and trauma program feasible. Sepsis and trauma diagnoses represent over 1,700 visits annually to CREST hospitals' emergency departments and are leading causes for admission to an ICU. Nationally, sepsis is the 10th leading cause of death overall with increasing incidence as the population ages. Survival is directly related to appropriate initial evaluation and management in the first six critical hours. Trauma is the leading cause of death among Americans up to age 45 and the fourth leading cause for all ages. Trauma outcomes are directly related to management in the initial ""golden"" hour. Thus, both conditions represent high acuity, high stakes crises that provoke anxiety among non-specialist providers. Currently, rural Lowcountry patients suffering from these conditions do not have access to specialist directed care and are unlikely to acquire on-site access in the future. Via a public/private partnership using technological advances, CREST will test an economically efficient, creative, alternative solution to this dilemma. The care of patients with sepsis and trauma requires the delivery of appropriate, definitive care in the early stages of the illness. Hospitals with limited resources, including those in rural and underserved areas of the Low Country and Pee Dee regions of South Carolina, may be unable to consistently provide optimal care to these patients. In addition, the shortage of specialists nationally makes it more difficult for these hospitals to recruit and retain the specialists they need. Patients in these areas continue to pay the rural penalty of poorer outcomes. This proposal will provide specialist level care through telemedicine consults to rural emergency departments in the Low Country and Pee Dee regions of SC to improve outcomes for these patients.               Project Narrative The care of patients with sepsis and trauma requires the delivery of appropriate, definitive care in the early stages of the illness.

"Variation in the Safety of Back Pain-Related Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09): Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic, 09-AG-101: Geographic Disparities in Medicare Usage. The proposed project will describe geographic disparities in quality of care of back surgery and examine hospital/surgeon characteristics associated with rates of repeat surgery higher than those in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT), the largest clinical trial ever funded by NIAMS (2,472 patients, 53 elite surgeons, 13 top hospitals in 11 states, and over $27 million in funding). SPORT provides Level 1 and Level 2 evidence for treatment of disc hernia ion, spinal stenos is, and degenerative spondylolisthesis; we propose to use it as the reference standard for comparing outcomes in back surgery. In SPORT, not only did patients have positive physical findings and correlated imaging findings, they also had a duration of associated symptoms (6-12 weeks plus) such that surgery would be a reasonable option. Furthermore, all patients experienced shared decision making (""Informed Choice""), wherein their values and preferences were recorded, a much higher standard of informed consent than is traditionally practiced. Outcomes for SPORT have been published in the most prestigious medical journals, with >5-year follow-up data accruing. Thus, we know how ""safe"" back surgery can be for common arthritis-related back disorders under the ideal conditions. Now we need to know if clinical practice meets these standards; and if not, why not? Patients seeking relief for severe back and leg symptoms are vulnerable not only to misperceptions about efficacy of some types of back surgery, but they may also underestimate the true risks versus desired benefits. Choice of surgery is an important, irreversible decision. For some types of surgery, reliable estimate of repeat surgery risk may be enough for patients to decide against the procedure. Regional variation in utilization of back surgery makes obvious lack of consensus on indications, but little is known about regional variation in terms of safety or the impact of this variation on decision-making. We know that despite good and appropriate indications some patients, when well informed, will decline surgical treatment. In SPORT several hundred patients, despite having very appropriate indications, declined surgical intervention and remained satisfied with their treatment decisions. We know surgeons may offer different types of back surgery to similar patients, and un-indicated or ineffective surgery is unlikely to relieve symptoms. Persistent back symptoms, in turn, may lead to additional surgery. To operate on a patient who, when well informed, would not chose to be operated on is, in fact, a SAFETY issue: it puts the patient at unnecessary risk. Repeat lumbar surgery is an undesirable safety outcome that surgeons and patients care about. We propose to use population-based rates of reoperation as a tool to study disparities in quality of care for back surgery. Using reoperation rates in SPORT as safety benchmarks for back surgery, we will determine which regional, hospital and/or surgeon factors are associated with reoperation rates higher than rates observed in SPORT. High rates of repeat surgery may point to ineffective initial surgery (labeled as ""overuse"" by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Roundtable on Health Care Quality) or potentially avoidable complications of surgery (labeled by IOM as ""misuse""). After adjusting for patient factors and surgical case-mix, repeat back surgery rates one or two standard deviations higher than SPORT rates may suggest problems with technical performance of surgery (""misuse"") or poor surgical indications (""overuse""). The National Quality Forum (NQF) has identified safety as a national priority, ""aiming for 'zero' harm wherever and whenever possible"", and it has recommended back surgery among its areas of focus for developing overuse measures. We propose population-based evaluation of repeat surgery rates in Medicare patients using validated methods for ascertaining lumbar surgery in administrative electronic health data. We will develop two indicators for measuring quality of care in back surgery: (1) ""Misuse"" we define as the 30-day or 1-year repeat lumbar surgery rate higher than the upper limit of SPORT 95% confidence intervals; and (2) ""Overuse"" we define as 4-year repeat surgery rate higher than the upper limit of the SPORT 95% confidence interval. We will rank de-identified individual hospitals and surgeons by reoperation rate and identify hospital/surgeon features associated with Misuse and Overuse. We also will describe geographic variation in back surgery Overuse across the 344 Dartmouth Atlas United States Hospital Referral Regions (HRR) and 3,300 Hospital Service Areas (HSA). The proposed work will refine electronic claims research methodology to allow ongoing back surgery safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness evaluations, and provide a necessary component of policy and payment reform strategies for making back surgery safer for all patients.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will compare differences in quality of care for back surgery across different hospitals and different surgeons by seeing how often a second operation is needed 30-days, 1-year, and 4-years after the initial operation as a quality indicator. The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, the largest ever back surgery study in which top surgeons and top hospitals performed surgery on carefully selected patients, sets the standard for how ""safe"" back surgery can be. We will see where back surgery safety falls short of the SPORT benchmarks, and which hospital factors and surgeon factors are associated with making back surgery less safe. This knowledge can help patients seeking surgical relief of arthritis-related back and leg symptoms make better choices on where to have surgery, and it can guide performance and incentive policies to make spinal surgery safer for all patients.               PulicHeathReevance We will compare differences in quality of care for back surgery across different hospitals and different surgeons by seeing how often a second operation is needed 30-days, 1-year, and 4-years after the initial operation as a quality indicator.

"Tense and Agreement in SAAE and SWE by Dialect Density and SLI Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the work is to examine the tense and agreement systems of children with and without specific language impairment (SLI) in Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). Although strides have been made in the study of SLI in SAAE and SWE, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of these dialects, and of the manifestations of SLI within them. These gaps in the literature create barriers to the representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this impedes the development of valid and efficient clinical services for children who speak these dialects. The focus of the work is on tense and agreement because recent findings from our lab and others indicate that nonstandard English-speaking children with SLI present difficulties with this aspect of language when compared to same dialect-speaking controls. These findings are consistent with two linguistic theories of SLI, the Extended Optional Infinitive account (EOI; Rice & Wexler, 1996; Rice, Wexler & Cleave, 1995) and the Feature-based Limited Functional Category account (F-LFC; Hegarty, 2005). Within the proposed work, we will further evaluate and specify the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE and complete four tests of the EOI and F-LFC models. The four tests involve: 1) the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE; 2) the nature of the tense and agreement systems of typically developing children who vary in their nonstandard dialect use; 3) the relation between measures of children's tense and agreement systems and their general language ability, cognition, and environment; and 4) the relation between children's overt marking of tense and agreement and their overt marking of other functional categories (negation, complementizers) within an utterance. For the first three tests, the models make similar predictions but for the fourth, the models make different predictions. To achieve these goals, we will complete one large-scale study of 240 children in eight participant groups. These groups will allow us to compare same-dialect speaking children with and without SLI to each other (Test 1); evaluate differences between groups of typically developing children who produce low, medium, and high densities of SAAE and SWE (Test 2); complete regression analyses (Test 3); and complete a functional category analysis of utterances that contain tense and agreement, negation, and complementizers (Test 4). The data will come from language samples, standardized testing, and experimental probes as has been done in studies of standard English. However, to adequately evaluate the children's language systems and test the predictions of the EOI and F-LFC models within SAAE and SWE, we will create dialect-appropriate stimuli and dialect-appropriate coding systems. Findings from the work will lead to improved clinical services for children and a reduction of the health disparities that exist in the rural Deep South and elsewhere. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South. The proposed studies seek to learn more about children within these communities by focusing on the grammatical profile of SLI within Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). The findings should lead to a better understanding of the SLI grammar profile within these dialects while also providing four tests of two linguistic models of SLI. These findings should result in greater representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this should lead to improved clinical services and a reduction of health disparities for children who live in the rural Deep South and elsewhere.           Health Impact Statement  Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South.

"Nurse Practice Environment Influences in Reducing Disparities In Hospital Outcome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to prepare Margo Brooks Carthon, PhD, RN, for an independent health services research career, with a special focus on disparities research. The career development plan entails three approaches to achieve the immediate and long-term career goals of the candidate, including 1) completion of training dedicated to acquiring skills in advanced health outcomes research methods and statistics; 2) enlistment of an expert mentorship team including Dr. Linda Aiken, PhD, FAAN, RN, Dr. Herbert Smith and Dr. David Barton Smith and 3) the conduct of a study to evaluate the influence of nurse practice environments on hospital outcomes of minority patients, that will lead to future R-series grant applications. I have an offer for a faculty position from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing upon the completion of my post-doctoral research fellowship. The research project seeks to understand how characteristics of the nurse work force and the nurse practice environment influence outcomes among hospitalized minority patients. This study will employ a cross sectional, observational design to determine the effects of nurse work force and the practice environment on selected patient outcomes in order to assess what types of investments in nursing resources might be most beneficial to minority patient outcomes. The specific aims of the research project are to: 1) examine the difference in post operative mortality and failure to rescue rates among minority and non-minority patients, and determine how much of the differences in minority patient outcomes are explained by underlying patient characteristics such as comorbidites or characteristics of the hospitals where minorities seek care; and 2) determine to what extent differences in minority patient post surgical outcomes are associated with nurse staffing, the proportion of nurses with BSN education, and the quality of the nurse practice environment. It is anticipated that the results of the study will inform managerial and policy initiatives on how to improve health outcomes, particularly in hospitals serving a large proportion of minorities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal directly addresses the public health concern regarding disparities in health outcomes among hospitalized racial and ethnic minorities. Its results will represent one of the first initiatives to evaluate the influence of nursing care and the practice environment on minority patient outcomes and will provide a preliminary assessment of what kinds of investments in nursing are most beneficial.        This proposal directly addresses the public health concern regarding disparities in health outcomes among hospitalized racial and ethnic minorities.

"Diagnostic Markers of Language Impairment in Bilinguals The estimated risk for language impairment (LI)in monolingual English speaking children is about 7%. A model for identifying language impairment, referredto as the EpiSLI system (Tomblin, Records, & Zhang, 1996), yields relatively high levels of specificity and sensitivity for identification of LI in kindergarten children from monolingual English speaking backgrounds. Systematic study is needed to determine a) the extent to which level of proficiency in English is related to risk for misidentification of language impairment, b) if the EpiSLI criteria can be applied to a new bilingual language test, c) to what extent testing (using a variety of assessment tasks) in English and the native language can be used to identify language impairment, and d) potential differences in the way bilingual learner's (language impaired vs. typical) performance on language measures changes with increased exposure to English. Due to the shortage of bilingual clinicians and the diversity of languages spoken in the US it would be helpful to determine the circumstances in which standardized testing, language learning measures, and/or processing measures administered in English can be used to reliably identify language impairment in bilingual children. We have planned a three phase study to address these issues. In phase 1,1500 Latino children will participate in language screening to determine the levels of risk across the bilingual population. In phase 2, a comparison of performance on standardized measures in Spanish and English will be administered to the at risk bilingual children identified in phase 1 to determine if the EpiSLI cut off values fold for bilinguals. Further, processing and learning measures will be administered in English to explore the extent to which such measures accurately predict language impairment at various levels of English proficiency. In phase 3, children will participate in follow up testing evaluating language growth. Assessment of the persistance of language impairment across a 1 year period will help determine whether increase in English language skills affects classification accuracy of language impairment when measures are utilized in English.

"Deaf People and Healthcare    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Steven Barnett MD is a family physician whose career has focused on healthcare with deaf people and families who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf people who communicate in ASL are a medically underserved and understudied vulnerable minority with much in common with other linguistic and socio cultural minority groups. Dr. Barnett's career goal is to be a leading expert and independent researcher on the topic of health and healthcare with deaf people and their families. The University of Rochester is an ideal place to work toward that goal, since Rochester has a large deaf population and the University of Rochester Medical Center is motivated to become a center of excellence on health promotion and disease prevention with people who are deaf. In order to achieve his goal, Dr. Barnett will pursue more advanced research training, including formal coursework in survey methods, epidemiology and sampling methods. He will also work with mentors, consultant and advisors to create individualized curricula focused on skills development in mixed quantitative and qualitative research methods, advanced ASL, and psychometrics, including issues related to translation and adaptation of English language tools for use with non-English populations. Dr. Barnett will work with his mentors, consultant and community advisory board to conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the healthcare experiences of deaf adult ASL-users. They will do this by translating and adapting the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) ambulatory care survey in order to collect information in ASL from deaf people about their healthcare experiences. They will administer CAHPS-ASL to four groups of deaf adult ASL-users in Rochester to learn about healthcare experiences in different settings. Dr. Barnett will bring the data and analyses back to his community advisory board and they will work together to plan future research and interventions to address the health and healthcare disparities experienced by deaf people and their families. CAHPS-ASL will be the first national survey adapted to learn about healthcare experiences from deaf adult ASL-users in their own language. Creating accessible research and addressing disparities are goals consistent with Healthy People 2010 objectives and essential to improve the quality and effectiveness of healthcare for this vulnerable population.           ",Deaf People and Healthcare,7929892,K08HS015700,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K08,2010,127059,0.029169048343253845
"PILOT: Home Telemonitoring for Self Management Education of Patients with Lung Ca    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The application is a pilot for a post-hospital home telemonitoring intervention to help people with lung cancer (CA) recognize changes in their condition and contact a clinician before emergent care is needed. WV lung CA illness and death rates exceed US averages. Limited knowledge and access to care have contributed to significant health disparities for WV lung CA patients, especially in rural areas. There is a critical need for low cost, high quality interventions to assist patients during the first two weeks following hospital discharge before they have scheduled follow-up clinician visits. Phone-transmitted telemonitor data will be used to alert nurses to explain changes in signs/symptoms and coach patients on when and how to contact a clinician. Telemonitors will provide early evidence of disease-related changes which can then be recognized by patients and relayed to their clinician before they exacerbate. To date, there have been no studies of telemonitor data used for education of adults with lung CA. Measures of effectiveness will be patient contacts to nurses/physicians, changes in treatment, use and cost of health care resources for 2 months following hospital discharge, as well as patient quality of life (QOL), and functional status. Study specific aims are: (1) Describe changes in telemonitored physiological measurements and subjective symptoms over 14-days following discharge in the telemonitor group; (2) Examine the differences in functional status, QOL, and patient/family satisfaction with and without home telemonitor-based education for self-management; and (3) Analyze differences in nurse/physician contact, treatment changes, and healthcare resource utilization with and without home telemonitor surveillance education for self-management. This study is important because improved knowledgeable patient self-management could impact long term outcomes. Patient direct contacts to clinicians for treatment and self-management would be less costly compared to emergency care or rehospitalization. Successful completion of the study would also help to fill the gap in knowledge about changes in lung CA patients' vital signs and symptoms between hospital discharge and the usual 2 week post-hospital visit. Consistent with the missions of NIH and NCI to build a knowledge base to alleviate the burdens of illness and disability and provide continuing care of cancer patients, our R15 grant application supports patient self-management based on signs/ symptom identification for appropriate clinician contact before problems exacerbate, improving QOL for adults with lung CA, and examining the satisfaction of patients and families with limited (14 day) telemonitor use. Nursing knowledge will be used to interpret telemonitor data and educate cancer patients at home after hospitalization. Short term remote telemonitoring-based patient education offers a promising option to develop patient self-management knowledge and skills.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: High costs of care for patients with lung cancer have been related to frequent hospitalizations and emergency care visits. There is a critical need to identify interventions to help people with lung cancer recognize changes in their condition and contact a clinician before emergent care is needed. The proposed study uses a self-management model to test the use of home   telemonitors as risk indicators after discharge in a sample of Appalachian adults hospitalized with lung cancer and comorbidities. Phone-transmitted telemonitor information will assist nurses to explain changes in signs/symptoms and coach patients on when and how to contact a clinician.

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Efficiency DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our original P01 grant application was motivated by the remarkable differences in health care intensity in the US. In this resubmission, we sharpen our focus in three ways. The goal is to understand and improve efficiency, the target is a more actionable level for physicians and the hospitals where they work, and the means include collaborations with key stakeholders to design successful interventions. The projects are: 1. Measuring the Efficiency of Health Care Providers. This project develops measures of efficiency - both quality and costs - and explores their implications at the level of primary care physicians, physician groups, and hospitals. We use Medicare data, patient and physician surveys, and specialty board certification scores from the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Family Practice. 2. Causes and Consequences of Variation in Pharmacotherapy Efficiency. We describe and model variation in prescription drug use using longitudinal claims data from very large insurance providers in two states, studying both consequences of variation in prescription drug use in outcomes and the impact of a large, systemic 'shock' - Medicare Part D - on existing treatment patterns and outcomes. 3. Technological Growth and the Efficiency of Health Care Diffusion. We study the contribution of ""high- tech"" health care to cost growth, the diffusion of different types of medical innovations, whether high-quality health providers affect population-level health outcomes, and how provider networks affect diffusion. 4. Geography and Disparities in Health and Health Care. We propose hospital-level disparity ""report cards,"" to study sorting of patients to disproportionately Black hospitals and to test whether the preferences of patients from a recent nation-wide survey of Medicare enrollees are reflected in their treatments. Finally, we estimate how racial differences in surgical rates affect disparities in actual health outcomes. 5. Norms Governing Physician Decision-Making For Critically III Elders. We use qualitative methods to describe the norms and values that influence the use of life-sustaining treatments among critically ill elders in emergency rooms and hospitals. We plan to test the feasibility of one or more interventions to change practice norms with the broader aim of improving efficiency. Cores: The Cores include an initiative to work with seven leading hospitals to address inefficiency in the provision of care, data support, and health efficiency measures for users of the Health and Retirement Study. Relevance: The project seeks to understand why efficiency is so poor in the U.S. health care system: 30% of health care spending is wasted, and quality of care is seriously lacking. We also explore several approaches to improving quality and reducing unwarranted variations in expenditures.",Causes and Consequences of Health Care Efficiency,7793501,P01AG019783,[''],NIA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,P01,2010,1500867,-0.0025910792234496876
"Biophysical Measure To Predict Pressure Ulcers In Nursing Home Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will test the validity of a non-visual assessment strategy for stage I pressure ulcers (PUs) among nursing home (NH) residents with light or dark skin tones using a multi-site, longitudinal cohort design. PUs are common, often preventable, and costly; detection of early-stage PUs is important because intervention may prevent decline to more severe PUs. The standard method of detection, visual skin assessment for non- blanchable erythema, is somewhat reliable for individuals with light skin tones but detects changes after skin damage has already occurred. In addition, visual skin assessment fails to detect skin color changes in persons with darkly pigmented skin. Documented health disparities between African Americans and Caucasians for incidence of stage I PUs and prevention intervention may be related to deficiencies in detection. In our prior studies, we showed that a hand-held device that assesses sub-epidermal moisture (SEM), a measure of edema from inflammatory changes in the tissues, identified stage I PUs. Further, SEM was higher (e.g., increased edema and inflammation) when there was no visible skin damage at the time but a stage I PU was visible on the skin one week later; SEM values predicted 26 percent of the subsequent stage I PUs. Findings were similar in a small sub-sample of NH residents with dark skin tones. We propose to test the validity of this innovative approach to detecting PUs, particularly focusing on residents with dark skin tones; to test threshold SEM values for detecting stage I PUs and detecting progression of stage I PUs to stage II+ PUs. We will recruit 389 NH residents, 62 of whom will have dark skin tones, who are at risk for PU based on the Minimum Data Set Assessment from 24 NHs. Visual skin assessments and blinded SEM measures will be completed by research staff at least weekly for consented residents for 4 months. Skin tone of NH residents will be assessed using color tiles rather than by proxy measures of ethnicity as in previous research. In addition, participant demographics, MDS assessment data on functional level, and comorbid medical conditions will be obtained from medical record review. Risk assessments using the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sores will be collected at baseline. Generalized ordered logistic modeling, appropriately modeling the repeated observations and time-dependent measures, will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of SEM measures to identify future skin damage. Measurement of SEM represents a potentially important tool for decreasing the disparity of prevention interventions between persons with different skin tones. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement to Public Health This project is the next step in the evaluation of a new assessment technique for bedsores, a common problem for nursing home residents. If this measurement can identify skin damage at an earlier stage to allow prompt intervention, evidence will be powerful for evaluating its use through a clinical trial.

"Understanding Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many studies have documented important racial disparities in surgical outcomes but their etiologies are not clear. While we generally find better surgical outcomes (lower mortality) at teaching hospitals, and a higher rate of minority patients at these hospitals, the survival benefit at teaching hospitals does not seem to equally apply to white and black patients. This application will explore why we observe disparities in three common surgical specialties that are performed throughout most hospitals where surgery is practiced: general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery. The application will focus on a classic measure of surgical practice - the procedure time. While always available on chart review, the ability to study surgical procedure time on a vast scale with Medicare claims is new. Anesthesiologists began billing Medicare by the minute in 1994. Using these bills to estimate procedure length in a population of Pennsylvania patients, we have recently published that there was a significant and clinically important disparity in the length of operations based on race and income, after detailed adjustment for patient characteristics and procedure type. This disparity was greatest at hospitals with residency programs, where the procedure time of black patients in the lowest third of the income distribution was on average 31 minutes longer than that of white patients at the same level of income (P<0.0001). In non-resident hospitals the mean gap was 8 minutes (P<0.0001). In further work we have shown that the disparity in procedure length gets larger with longer procedure times (at the 95 percentile using quantile regression, the difference between blacks and whites is about 3 of an hour). Furthermore, in our examination of all teaching and non-teaching hospitals in the state of Pennsylvania, the 15 hospitals with the largest number of black patients undergoing orthopedic and general surgery, excess adjusted procedure time (black-white by hospital) was statistically significant in 5 of 15 hospitals, with their mean excess times ranging from 9 to 16 minutes. The strength of using operative time as a measure of disparity is that it reflects precisely what the surgical and anesthesia team have done, and is not confounded by patient compliance or preferences, as some other measures of process and outcome may be. This application aims: (1) To study and describe racial and income/SES disparity in procedure time across surgeons and hospitals; (2) To identify the determinants of disparity in procedure time across surgeons and hospitals. We will study those geographic, hospital, and surgeon characteristics associated with the greatest disparities in procedure time; and (3) To make practical recommendations to departments of surgery regarding procedure length and to create models to allow surgery departments to practically monitor such disparities in order to develop mechanisms to eliminate problems if found.  Project Narrative Minority Medicare patients undergoing surgery often have worse outcomes and longer procedure times than whites with comparable comorbidities and procedures. This project aims to understand this disparity between minority and white Americans undergoing surgery through studying disparities in procedure time.",Understanding Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes,7930588,R01AG032963,"['Residencies ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Shoulder ', ' Archives ', ' Societies ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' surgery specialty ', ' Surgical Profession ', ' Surgical Specialties ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Beds ', ' Belief ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' Familiarity ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Censuses ', ' Litigation ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' General Practices ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' medical specialist ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' primary outcome ', ' operation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Provider ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' Low income ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Length ', ' Caring ', ' Board Certification ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Hand ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Teaching Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Hospital Sizes ', ' Link ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Income Distributions ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Training ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Literature ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Malpractice ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' news ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' tool ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' ']",NIA,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2010,547602,0.0429236042925038
"Racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals for coronary heart disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this K08 application is to support Dr loana Popescu to become an independent investigator in the area of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. The application will involve the assimilation of new methodological skills and the analysis of a number of existing health care databases. In support of the application, Dr. Popescu has assembled a team of experienced mentors-Drs. Gary Rosenthal (Department of Internal Medicine), Gerald Rushton (Geography), and Kevin Leicht (Sociology), who bring expertise in complementary methodological areas and who have assisted Dr. Popescu in designing integrated plans for career development and research. The Career Plan includes advanced training in: 1) hierarchical biostatistical modeling and clinical research ethics; 2) the application of spatial analysis and geographic information systems methods in health care; and 3) methods for measuring residential segregation and understanding its sociological roots. These goals will be accomplished through targeted coursework, tutorials, directed readings, and direct research experiences guided by her mentors. The Research Plan will examine the interplay between geography, segregation and health care system factors, in order to build a comprehensive understanding of why black patients are less likely to receive care for acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass surgery in high quality hospitals. The Research Plan includes three incremental aims that capitalize on a number of national data sources, including: Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims files; US Census data; American Hospital Association surveys; the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile; and Dartmouth Atlas health care market data. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between race, proximity to the admitting and to high quality hospitals, and the likelihood of admission to high quality hospitals. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of residential segregation on disparities in admissions to high quality hospitals. Aim 3 will examine the effects of patterns of prior outpatient care on disparities in admission to high quality hospitals and will build Dr. Popescu's fluency in analyzing more complex outpatient physician claims files.              ",Racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals for coronary heart disease,7892267,K08HL095930,"['Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Accounting ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Guidelines ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geography ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Inpatients ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rights ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Atlases ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' skills ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Bypass ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Assimilations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Accounting ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2010,127027,0.04249426073131852
"The Caregiving Trajectory for Community-Dwelling Mexican-American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caregiving burden among Hispanic caregivers is a little understood and growing problem. As a result, research to address caregiver burden and prevent institutionalization in these populations is critical. It is estimated that there are over 42 million Hispanics in the U.S. and the cohort over age 65 is expected to grow faster than any other racial or ethnic group, tripling in number by 2050. Thirteen percent of Hispanic households currently provide care to an adult aged 50 or older whose life expectancy will increase to 87 years by 2050, surpassing all other ethnic groups. Given this dramatic shift in demographics, a burgeoning number of Hispanic families will be placed in a caregiving role. The purpose of this proposed study is to investigate the burden of caregiving in this at-risk population by describing the level, circumstances, and consequences of caregiver burden/strain, and determining the impact of cultural and contextual variables on caregiving and caregiver gain, along with factors that lead to nursing home admission. This proposed project is a longitudinal mixed methods descriptive study designed to intensively explore the natural course of caregiving, caregiving burden and strain, caregiver gain, and admission to nursing homes among Mexican-American families. One hundred ten caregiver-care recipient cases will be enrolled and followed for 15 months. Interviews and standardized questionnaires will be completed at baseline and every 10 weeks, with an additional measurement point if nursing home admission occurs. We will compare and contrast transitions and turning points in the caregiving trajectory (taking into account acculturation, the nature of the caregiver-care recipient relationship, gender, functional and cognitive status, and depression); identify factors that support caregiving; and determine what factors are most important in delaying institutionalization. The core component will be a case-oriented approach, that is, an intensive, qualitatively-driven, study of cases with an eye toward configurations of similarities and differences. A simultaneous, complementary, quantitatively-driven variable-oriented component will look for broad patterns across cases and enable the drawing of inferences based on these broad patterns. These approaches will be integrated throughout the analytic and interpretive phases of the study. This in-depth, systematic research into the caregiving trajectory should prove useful in designing interventions that are timed to occur simultaneously with known crisis points and help keep elders at home or to help families acknowledge when formal nursing home care should be sought. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using life course perspective, this longitudinal, descriptive, mixed methods study is designed to explore the natural course of caregiving, caregiving burden and strain, caregiver gain, and admission to nursing homes among 110 Mexican-American families. The core component will be a case-oriented approach, that is, an intensive, qualitatively-driven, study of cases with an eye toward configurations of similarities and differences.

"Improving Reporting of Race, Ethnicity, and Language in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  California is home to a large and diverse population of over 37 million individuals, including the largest Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, and Asian populations in the U.S. A large percentage of these individuals are linguistically isolated. Disparities in care are well documented to be significantly higher among racial/ethnic minorities and among those with language barriers. Although California requires race, ethnicity, and language reporting, a lack of specific guidelines for what, how, and when this data should be collected has contributed to inconsistency in reporting, a significant barrier to better understanding the magnitude of health disparities. California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD), a state agency, is responsible for the routine collection of patient-level hospital inpatient, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery data across the state. The Patient Discharge Database has over 4 million discharges annually and is the largest single constituent database contributing to the AHRQ National Inpatient Sample and the largest inpatient database offered by AHRQ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Over ten million emergency department encounters and 2.4 million ambulatory surgeries are reported to OSHPD annually. In response to RFA-HS-10-010, ""ARRA OS: Recovery Act 2009 Limited Competition: Enhanced State Data for Analysis and Tracking of Comparative Effectiveness Impact: Improved Clinical Content and Race-Ethnicity Data (R01),"" a team of allied researchers led by investigators from the University of California in collaboration with the leadership of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, propose a three- year programmatic intervention to improve the reliability, validity, and completeness of self-reported race, ethnicity, and primary language provided by hospitals in the three databases that are currently within OSHPD's regulatory mandate. The aims of the proposed project are to: 1. Perform a baseline assessment of race, ethnicity, and language data collection, reporting, and accuracy in  hospitals in California and comparison states. 2. Directly improve the accuracy and reliability of race, ethnicity, and language information collected by  hospitals (direct improvement to self-reported data). 3. Use supplemental data and statistical approaches to improve race and ethnicity measures reported by hospitals (indirect improvement to self-reported data). Through this AHRQ-funded project, we expect to make substantial and sustainable improvements to the reporting of race, ethnicity, and primary language among patients receiving care in California's hospitals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aim of the proposed research is to incrementally improve the completeness and accuracy of self-report race, ethnicity, and language collected from all patients treated as inpatients, emergency department patients, or receiving ambulatory surgery in California hospitals.

"Computational and Behavioral Evidence for Bilingual Aphasia Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population. Diagnosis and treatment of bilingual aphasia is one area where disparities continue to exist even though this topic is of great importance in an increasingly bilingual world. The current research on this topic, however, lacks specific recommendations on which languages should be trained in a bilingual aphasic individual and to what extent cross-language transfer occurs subsequent to rehabilitation. Factors contributing to the paucity of research in this area relate to the multitude of possible language combinations in a bilingual individual, the relative competency of the two languages of the bilingual individual and the effect of focal brain damage on bilingual language representation. It is, however, unfeasible to examine these issues without undertaking a large scale longitudinal study in this population. As a potential solution, the proposed project will systematically examine the extent of cross-language transfer subsequent to rehabilitation using a computational model. This model will be developed to simulate a bilingual language system in which language representations can vary by age of acquisition and relative proficiency, and will be subsequently lesioned and retrained to improve output. The training will be provided in one language and the extent of cross-language transfer will be examined. It is predicted that age of acquisition, the level of pre-morbid language proficiency and post-morbid language performance will influence the nature and degree of cross-language transfer. Further, the model's power to predict the optimal language to be treated will be compared to data obtained from behavioral interventions from a sample of patients with bilingual aphasia. The proposed work is innovative, because it uses a computational model to predict optimal rehabilitation protocols to facilitate the greatest amount of language recovery in bilingual aphasia. The successful completion of this project is expected to have an important impact on rehabilitation of stroke and bilingual aphasia as well as on the applications of computational modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project is relevant because it will address the important issue of language recovery following treatment in bilingual aphasic individuals by comparing performance in treated bilingual aphasic individuals with the performance of a computational model simulating aphasia in a bilingual lexicon. Establishment of the efficacy of rehabilitation in each of the languages of the bilingual aphasic individual is important because there are currently no clear recommendations on the best approach for rehabilitation of bilingual aphasia.           This project is relevant because it will address the important issue of language recovery following treatment in bilingual aphasic individuals by comparing performance in treated bilingual aphasic individuals with the performance of a computational model simulating aphasia in a bilingual lexicon.

"TDARS: Translated Document Assembly and Retrieval System (Phase II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, significant disparity exists in the vital healthcare documents being provided to limited English-proficient (LEP) patients. In 2007, a nationwide survey of hospitals by The Joint Commission found that only 50 percent of hospitals had translated informed consent documents. Even then, the translations were often only available in Spanish. Other types of documents were translated even less frequently. Hospitals, with limited budgets for language services, are struggling to allocate resources to create quality, translated documents for their patients. During the 2005 Roundtable on Health Disparity and Information Technology, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Office of Minority Health (OMH) identified a national repository of translated documents as a high priority need to reduce medical errors due to language miscommunication. During Phase I of this grant, we developed and evaluated a new web-accessible platform for documents that demonstrated feasibility in creating, managing, sharing, printing, and speaking documents to patients in foreign languages. This platform, called TDARS (Translated Document Assembly and Retrieval System), allows healthcare organizations to quickly assemble coherent vital healthcare documents, instantly create quality, translated versions that can be printed, and then instruct a computer to read the translated documents to the patients. TDARS offers a high degree of flexibility in customizing documents for each organization, enables documents to be shared among institutions, provides a method to comply with The Joint Commission's document access standards, and can do all this for less than the average cost of translating one document in one language - making a library of documents economically accessible to even the smallest hospitals. During Phase II, our objective is to develop a commercial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product for hospitals and other healthcare organizations offered through a subscription-pricing model. We will expand TDARS to include a core set of documents identified as being of greatest need during our Phase I evaluation, making them available in the languages identified as being most common and challenging nationwide (Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Russian, Arabic, Korean, and Somali). Thirty participating sites will be recruited that represent our target market population of small and medium-sized hospitals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A national repository of quality, pre-translated documents that can speak the documents to patients could dramatically reduce the disparity of information provided to our limited English proficient patients. Current methods of translating documents are expensive, the quality of translations is inconsistent, and efforts are being duplicated by multiple hospitals.

"""COA360: Measuring Cultural Competence in Healthcare""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase 1 STTR application seeks support for research to enhance the commercial viability of a tool to assess the ""cultural competence"" of health care organizations. The tool was developed by Dr. Thomas A.  LaVeist, who is director of the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The Cultural-competency Organizational Assessment - 360 (COA360) is a web-based tool to measure the cultural competence of healthcare organizations, and provides evidence-based interventions to help organizations improve. To date, the COA360 is the only cultural competency assessment tool to have undergone a rigorous validation study. The results of that study were published in the Journal of Healthcare Management (LaVeist et al. 2008). It is also the only cultural competency organizational assessment is administered online (COA360.ORG).  A pilot test of the website has been completed and additional refinements have been made based on that test. The next step in establishing the technical/scientific merit and feasibility of the COA360 is to conduct simultaneous assessments on several hospitals, an evaluation of the experiences of the participants using the system, and a subsequent study of the effects of use of the COA360 process on improving the cultural competency of healthcare organizations. Specifically, this application seeks to address three specific aims for Phase I of the STTR Process:     Specific Aim 1: to finalize the report format for the COA360.  Specific Aim 2: to conduct a systematic evaluation of the user experience using the COA360.  Specific Aim 3: to conduct a systematic evaluation of the efficacy of the COA360 report content and format.      In Phase 2 of STTR funding, the aims will be to: (1) develop an intervention website for the COA360 system. This will involve the development of a web-based tool to deliver evidence-based interventions to help healthcare organizations improve their ability to meet the needs of the increasingly diverse U.S.  population; (2)  enroll a set of healthcare units into a study to determine if exposure to the intervention  can improve cultural competency; (3) make additional enhancements to the system including  (translating the COA360 into other languages, incorporate enhanced online help into the web-based  system, and write a manual for the hospital point of contact.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The COA360 (Cultural-competency Organizational Assessment - 360) is a web-based tool to measure the cultural competence of healthcare organizations, and provides evidence-based interventions to help organizations improve. It is the only assessment tool to have undergone a rigorous validation study, and the only cultural competency organizational assessment administered online (COA360.ORG). Improving the cultural competence of a healthcare organization will lessen miscommunication between patients and healthcare providers, and increase provider sensitivity to the values, beliefs and health-related practices of the clients.  This would increase the cultural relevance and acceptability of health educational messages, improve the accuracy of diagnoses and interventions, and improve adherence.  The result should be improved patient satisfaction, better health outcomes, and a narrowing of gaps in disparities in health status and quality of care among racial/ethnic, religious and linguistic groups. We propose to conduct simultaneous assessments on several hospitals and to conduct an evaluation of the  experiences of the participants using the system, and conduct a study of the effects of use of the  COA360 process on improving the cultural competency of healthcare organizations.                   PROJECT NARRATIVE  The COA360 (Cultural-competency Organizational Assessment - 360) is a web-based tool to measure the  cultural competence of healthcare organizations, and provides evidence-based interventions to help  organizations improve.

"Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telemedicine can be defined as the delivery of healthcare services to distal locations by electronic connectivity. In recent years, telemedicine has expanded to include a wide range of remotely delivered services, including vital signs monitoring, medication management, ""telepsychiatry"" and others. The increasing utilization of telemedicine is driven by cost and, for distal (""underserved"") regions, a lack of professionals to deliver otherwise unavailable services. This proposal aims to develop a computerized assessment system capable of providing remote, audio-video-based administration of a wide range of commonly applied cognitive test instruments as well as behavioral-psychiatric measures (BPMs), in a similar manner as if the examiner were sitting face-to-face with the subject being evaluated. The proposed Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) will enable qualified clinicians to remotely conduct thorough neuropsychological or psychiatric evaluations of research subjects or patients with a range of acquired brain disorders for which such assessments are routinely applied, including: traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumor, neurotoxicologicalinsult,HIV-relatedencephalopathy,schizophrenia,and Alzheimer's disease. Remote locations broadly include clinical evaluation units at hospitals, managed care facilities, group practice sites, nursing homes, correctional facilities, regional health clinics, and in patient's homes, in both rural and metropolitan areas. The CARES will implement a fundamentally new approach in which a remote examiner views a full-screen, application-specific GUI that provides on- screen controls that will enable an examiner to: control the pace of the test session, repeat and supplement computerized instructions, immediately score verbal report or overt behavior in real time, and pause or terminate a test. Thus, the CARES is well suited for application in impaired populations that commonly require ongoing monitoring and supplemental instruction. Significantly, the CARES is a technological extension of a previously validated, dual-display, computerized assessment system in which the subject is physically accompanied by a human examiner. The GUI for this antecedent system will be adapted to host a high-resolution televideo window that permits an examiner and patient to see and talk to each other, establishing high-quality ""telepresence"", which is especially important for the administration of tests or BPMs involving subjective impressions or judgement of overt behavior. Accordingly, the CARES approach contrasts sharply with available, web-based assessments that are not only unaccompanied by an examiner, but suffer from rigid administration procedures, as well as multiple technical shortcomings, that significantly limit the range of test instruments that can be reliably administered to impaired individuals. In Phase II, the main objectives are to: 1) develop an application- optimized, standardized, mobile CARES Hardware Platform (CHP) with integrated peripheral devices and software utilities; and 2)compare the concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and user acceptability of accompanied computerized testing vs. remote computerized testing. The CARES will be the first system of its kind and will likely find immediate commercial application across a range of healthcare delivery networks, research settings, and controlled clinical trials.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) is a unique and highly innovative technology intended to facilitate televideo-based neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation services in areas that are currently ""underserved"" due to either geographic or economic obstacles that limit access to properly trained professionals who provide such services. Among these underserved populations are individuals living in rural areas or remote regions such as Indian reservations, individuals incarcerated in correctional facilities, and a variety of ""homebound"" individuals such as non-ambulatory patients or residents of nursing homes. The need to provide otherwise unavailable mental health services to these patients is a pressing disparity that the current project hopes to address.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) is a unique and highly innovative technology intended to facilitate televideo-based neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation services in areas that are currently ""underserved"" due to either geographic or economic obstacles that limit access to properly trained professionals who provide such services.

"Infrastucture for CER on Innovative Delivery Systems for Complex Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a statewide data infrastructure for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) on healthcare delivery innovations for complex patients in low-income communities. It addresses two CER priorities established by the Institute of Medicine in 2009 to evaluate outcomes of: (1) ""...comprehensive care coordination programs, such as the medical home, in managing children and adults with severe chronic disease, especially in populations with known health disparities""; and (2) ""accountable care systems ...for geographically defined populations of patients with one or more chronic diseases."" Responding to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality request for applications (RFA-HS-10-001) to expand research capability to study comparative effectiveness in complex patients, this project has three specific aims: 1. Build a sustainable longitudinal database of linked hospital, Medicaid, and charity care claims and encounter records in New Jersey for CER on strategies to improve the delivery of care to complex patients in low-income communities. 2. Build and evaluate measures of resource use and quality of care for CER on innovative delivery systems for complex patients in low-income communities using the database developed under Aim 1. 3. Demonstrate the potential of this new research infrastructure by conducting a pilot evaluation of health services resource use and quality for complex patients served by an innovative care coordination program in Camden, NJ. Designed to become an ongoing enterprise, the data infrastructure will initially consist of six years of state program administrative records. Products of this work will be disseminated widely and the database will be released for public use. The project builds on a long-standing collaboration between university researchers and agencies of New Jersey government, and will take place in the context of state policies encouraging innovation in health care delivery for low-income urban populations. New Jersey is especially well suited to CER on health system delivery innovations because it has exceptionally high rates of preventable utilization of expensive hospital care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with complex health conditions in low-income communities frequently experience inadequate and fragmented health services, leading to avoidable use of expensive hospital care and poor outcomes. This project will build research capacity to compare the cost and quality of health care delivery system innovations to care typically received by medically complex patients in low-income communities in New Jersey.          ",Infrastucture for CER on Innovative Delivery Systems for Complex Patients,8020258,R24HS019678,[''],AHRQ,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R24,2010,983802,-0.004479148446735151
"Understanding Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Outcomes of Medicare Home Health C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reports have highlighted the significant cuts in Medicare home health benefits recently. Racial/ethnic minorities have been especially affected. Studies have provided some initial, but inconclusive, evidence that these decreases in service are having a larger impact on home health outcomes for minorities. Limitations in prior research, prevent us from determining whether and to what extent race is a critical factor in home health outcomes. Understanding racial/ethnic disparities in the home health system is essential for advancing the overall health of the Medicare population. By improving the health care and status of minority patients we stand to greatly improve the effectiveness of our healthcare system and reduce costs from morbidity and mortality. The goal of the study is to enhance understanding of the patient, agency, clinical practice, and system factors that contribute to racial disparities in home health as a first step toward alleviating disparities. The specific aims are to: examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and home health outcomes including health status and adverse events; explore the patient, agency, and system factors that mediate/moderate the relationship between race/ethnicity and home health outcomes; conduct qualitative interviews with home care agency staff to help interpret the quantitative findings, and explore the clinical practice factors that influence the relationship between race/ethnicity and outcomes. This mixed methods study will combine data from the Outcome Assessment Information Set (OASIS), Home Health Agency Standard Analytical File (HHASAF), Provider of Services (POS) file, census, and Area Resource File (ARF). By combining multiple data sets representing the entire population of Medicare home health users the study will analyze a comprehensive set of patient, clinical practice, agency, and system factors that may contribute to disparities; examine outcomes for more racial/ethnic groups than previous studies; enhance representativeness; better approximate the complex construct of health outcomes by examining its multiple dimensions; and have adequate power to examine multiple contributing factors with controls. Regression will be used to identify mediators and moderators. Change in health status between admission to home care and discharge will be measured via OASIS data items covering functional, physiologic, cognitive and behavioral dimensions of health. Adverse events such as emergency care, hospitalization, or discharge with care needs occurring during the home care episode will also be analyzed. The quantitative analysis will also be used to identify high and low performing agencies by race on outcomes for the qualitative interviews. Qualitative interviews with home health agency staff around the nation will be used to interpret the findings of the quantitative work and to more deeply explore clinical practice factors which contribute to disparities in home care. This sequential mixed methods study will enable critical evaluation of the impact of race on home health outcomes and agency staff views on what patient, clinical practice, agency, and system interventions would be most appropriate to implement change. Public Health Relevance: Health disparities are a critical public health concern for 2 reasons: 1) they are indicative of an underlying inequality in our health care system; and 2) they result in poorer outcomes for minority and other vulnerable populations. Our focus on how disparities occur in Medicare home health care, emphasizes factors amenable to change thereby enabling us to develop specific interventions to reduce such disparities. The elimination of racial/ethnic health disparities holds the greatest promise to improve the overall health status of our society, while at the same time directly benefiting vulnerable populations.                 Project Narrative Health disparities are a critical public health concern for 2 reasons: 1) they are indicative of an underlying inequality in our health care system; and 2) they result in poorer outcomes for minority and other vulnerable populations.

"Estimating Hospital Outcome Quality: Applications to Pay-for-Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will pursue two major areas of research related to quality measurement and payment policy reform to improve value in healthcare. The first pertains to the evaluation and design of estimators of outcome quality and cost in order to profile the performance of healthcare providers. This research will evaluate the performance of existing estimators of outcome performance, propose new estimators, and validate the performance of these estimators to profile the quality, cost, and efficiency of hospitals and physician practices. The second area of research I will pursue is an evaluation of the Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) hospital-based pay-for-performance (P4P) program. I will test the effect of the P4P program on quality and cost for the areas incentivized in the program (maternity and newborn care, community acquired pneumonia, surgical infection prevention, pediatric asthma). I will also estimate the effect of the program on racial and ethnic disparities. To evaluate the performance of outcome measures, a simulation model will be constructed and a series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments will be designed and implemented. The basic approach is as follows: hypothetical providers are randomly assigned a ""true"" outcome score, a performance improvement trajectory, a patient risk score, a sample size, and a sample size trajectory. A random shock, inversely associated with sample size, is then created for each provider. Observed outcome scores, derived as a function of true outcome quality, patient risk, and the random shock are created for each hospital. Using only information on observed outcomes, true outcomes are then estimated using the candidate outcome estimators and the performance of these estimators is compared. The performance of these estimators will then be validated for hospitals and physicians using national Medicare data and data from Massachusetts. To evaluate the effect of the MassHealth program on quality, costs, and racial and ethnic disparities, I will draw on methods employed in my previous research. This will involve the use of panel data econometric techniques to test whether Massachusetts hospitals increased quality and decreased cost for MassHealth patients after the program was implemented. To examine the effect of the program on disparities, I will test for reductions in both within-hospital disparities in quality and between-hospital disparities in quality after the program was implemented. The skills and knowledge required to pursue my proposed research will be bolstered by an outstanding group of mentors and a robust education and career development plan. My mentors are leaders in the fields of payment and financing of healthcare, quality measurement, organizational research, health economics, and comparative effectiveness. Further, my mentors employ insights and perspectives from economics, political science, sociology, and clinical practice in their research, providing a rich and diverse intellectual environment from which I can draw upon as a mentee. In following my career development plan, I will enhance my methodological and programming skills, learn more about the responsible conduct of research, acquire knowledge of clinical practice and medical organization, and present my research findings and interact with colleagues at several national conferences. Research that successfully fulfills the aims of my K01 proposal will have important policy relevance. The proposed research will add to our knowledge about the use of outcome measures in pay-for-performance and public quality reporting while also providing further evidence about the effectiveness of pay-for- performance through the evaluation of the Massachusetts program. While ambitious, my track record of research achievement shows that I am capable of conducting research that achieves these aims. Further, the coursework and applied research conducted for the K01 will augment my research skills, enhancing my ability to achieve these aims. After collaborating with my mentors on this research, I will be have established myself as a researcher in the fields of P4P and quality measurement, positioning myself for R01 grants in these areas.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project has the potential to positively impact public health by creating more accurate estimators of healthcare provider outcome quality and cost and by contributing to the understanding of the effect of hospital-based pay-for-performance.

"TDARS: Translated Document Assembly and Retrieval System (Phase II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, significant disparity exists in the vital healthcare documents being provided to limited English-proficient (LEP) patients. In 2007, a nationwide survey of hospitals by The Joint Commission found that only 50 percent of hospitals had translated informed consent documents. Even then, the translations were often only available in Spanish. Other types of documents were translated even less frequently. Hospitals, with limited budgets for language services, are struggling to allocate resources to create quality, translated documents for their patients. During the 2005 Roundtable on Health Disparity and Information Technology, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Office of Minority Health (OMH) identified a national repository of translated documents as a high priority need to reduce medical errors due to language miscommunication. During Phase I of this grant, we developed and evaluated a new web-accessible platform for documents that demonstrated feasibility in creating, managing, sharing, printing, and speaking documents to patients in foreign languages. This platform, called TDARS (Translated Document Assembly and Retrieval System), allows healthcare organizations to quickly assemble coherent vital healthcare documents, instantly create quality, translated versions that can be printed, and then instruct a computer to read the translated documents to the patients. TDARS offers a high degree of flexibility in customizing documents for each organization, enables documents to be shared among institutions, provides a method to comply with The Joint Commission's document access standards, and can do all this for less than the average cost of translating one document in one language - making a library of documents economically accessible to even the smallest hospitals. During Phase II, our objective is to develop a commercial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product for hospitals and other healthcare organizations offered through a subscription-pricing model. We will expand TDARS to include a core set of documents identified as being of greatest need during our Phase I evaluation, making them available in the languages identified as being most common and challenging nationwide (Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Russian, Arabic, Korean, and Somali). Thirty participating sites will be recruited that represent our target market population of small and medium-sized hospitals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A national repository of quality, pre-translated documents that can speak the documents to patients could dramatically reduce the disparity of information provided to our limited English proficient patients. Current methods of translating documents are expensive, the quality of translations is inconsistent, and efforts are being duplicated by multiple hospitals. Both the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Office of Minority Health (OMH) have indicated that creating such a repository is a national priority.           Project Narrative A national repository of quality, pre-translated documents that can speak the documents to patients could dramatically reduce the disparity of information provided to our limited English proficient patients.

"Mechanisms for Enhancing Scholarly Achievements (MESA)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms for Enhancing Scholarly Achievements (MESA)  Abstract  The purpose of this randomized, controlled prospective-cohort-longitudinal study is to increase  understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the transition of a diverse group of Academic Health  Science Center graduate students who are enrolled in clinical programs of study (medicine, nursing,  dentistry, allied health, and public health) into planned pursuit of a clinical research scientist career. The framework for this initial test of an integrated series of interventions designed to build interdisciplinary research teams has a cognitive learning theory assumptive base specifying intra-person and organization resources that make it possible to reach desired scholarly achievement goals despite exposure to learning anxiety and uncertainty that accompanies entry into a team science learning frame. The theory informed  intervention strategies incorporate the following elements:  "" Motivation direction and strength interventions to foster the development of personal research   career goals;  "" Faculty and community mentor pool that link student participation with an interdisciplinary   research team;  "" Research team building support to promote collaboration and healthy competition;  "" Individual capacity building essential cognitive skills (problem solving, cognitive reframing, delay   in gratification and belief in self relative to research self-efficacy);  "" Participation across five semesters in team-based research projects directed toward health   promotion/restoration for persons from vulnerable populations;  "" A scholars' seminar series (across five semesters) focused on essential research content and   proficiencies.  Five aims and 10 linked hypotheses address a test of outcomes and modeling of the proposed learning process that begins with Motivator Direction and Strength and ends with Scholarly Activity and Career Path plan.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about the factors that influence the pursuit of a research career by minority persons.

"Role of English Fluency in Spanish Neuropsychological Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies primarily emanating from the cognitive science literature suggest both advantages and disadvantages of bilingualism for cognitive performance. The Interference Hypothesis suggests that while interacting in two languages (e.g., English and Spanish), bilinguals' capacity to communicate in one language decreases as a function of the second language interfering in their language-based cognitive processes. The Inhibitory Control Model, a refinement of this hypothesis, states that bilinguals must suppress the non-target language to allow production of the intended language. This constant experience with linguistic conflict resolution can be seen as practice of executive and attentional control, thus predicting a bilingual advantage on tasks requiring these abilities. While most of the work in bilingual neuro-cognition has been conducted using such cognitive science paradigms, often with college students, translation Into competent healthcare for linguistically diverse groups requires understanding how these performance predictions fit into an applied neuropsychology work frame, such as would be used when delivering care, and with a broader demographic representation. Given that Spanish speakers in the U.S. vary in English fluency, it is important to understand how this second language fluency affects neuropsychological (NP) performance in the first language. This has implications for the interpretation of test results when diagnosing brain dysfunction in bilingual patients. To this end, the proposed study will examine the effects of English fluency on Spanish language neuropsychological test performance hypothesizing relationships derived from existing cognitive science models. In addition, it will explore whether bilingual advantages observed in our preliminary data are explained by socioeconomic and acculturation differences between bilinguals and monolinguals. Finally, in order to understand the clinical significance of these potential performance differences, the proposed study will examine whether clinically meaningful bilingual advantages are observed in HIV+ individuals, a patient population in whom brain dysfunction is common. Participants will be 80 healthy HIV- men and women (40 bilingual and 40 demographically comparable monolingual), and 40 bilingual and 40 monolingual HIV+ participants with comparable demographic and disease characteristics. All will be native Spanish speakers of Mexican descent. Bilingualism will be determined based on a language preference questionnaire as well as objective measures of verbal fluency in each language. Participants will receive neuropsychological and psychosocial assessments. The knowledge gained will help to bridge health disparities in the competent neuropsychological assessment of diverse populations. My most direct goal will be to carry out the research plan proposed in this application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this type of research is to inform the development of valid ways to assess cognitive functioning in culturally and linguistically diverse populations. This will result in better quality of care across the spectrum of brain diseases, as such that caused by HIV. Understanding the ways in which socio-demographic characteristics impact cognition should ultimately, and ideally, not only affect the construction of assessment instruments but also point a direction in public policy toward maximizing the possibilities of an enriched developmental environment for people living under disadvantaged conditions. As a long-term goal Dr. Cherner and I would like to extend the already emerging international work of the   HNRC by setting up collaborations with other Latin American countries, to study the impact of neuro AIDS and associated conditions such as toxoplasmosis in different regions. My hope is that we can disseminate the knowledge obtained here in the U.S. Dr. to various countries in Latin America. Dr. Cherner, being a native of Argentina, and I, being a native of Colombia, make this goal a plausible one. It is my long term goal as a scientist and professor of a University in the United States that to one day I will be able to disseminate culturally appropriate assessment tools in developing countries were the need is great but resources are limited.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My most direct goal will be to carry out the research plan proposed in this application.

"Educational Television Program for Children of Immigrant Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The language barrier between immigrant parents and their English-dominant children is a pervasive and relatively unrecognized problem in an estimated 12 million U.S. households. This intergenerational language gap often leads to adverse health outcomes for both children and adults for the following reasons: (1) it hinders young children's ability to communicate with their parents when they feel sick; and (2) as children are inevitably relied upon as interpreters for family members during office visits and medical emergencies, they are ill-prepared both linguistically and mentally for such a difficult task.  This project seeks to develop a television program that can bridge the intergenerational language gap and improve the health status of all members of an immigrant household. During our Phase I study, we developed a pilot episode and successfully demonstrated that it was an effective tool for achieving both of the stated educational goals. This Phase II proposal seeks to build on that foundation and create a six-episode animated series, focusing on the issue of childhood nutrition and obesity prevention amongst the Hispanic population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed project will develop an innovative television series that combines language and health education and can be enjoyed by both children and parents. The television program aims to enhance children's language skills in their heritage language, improve immigrant parents' English proficiency, provide exposure to important health concepts, and promote intergenerational communication.             ",Educational Television Program for Children of Immigrant Families,7864321,R44HD054080,"['Sesame - dietary ', ' Sesame ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Length ', ' Advocate ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Family ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Institutes ', ' Ensure ', ' Language ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Learning ', ' obesity in children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' New York ', ' Immigrant ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Exposure to ', ' Program Development ', ' tool ', ' grandparent ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' programs ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Television ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Writing ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' instructor ', ' Services ', ' pediatric department ', ' age group ', ' elementary school ', ' sociolinguistics ', ' intergenerational ', ' phrases ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Controlled Study ', ' outreach ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Child Language ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' obesity prevention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' ']",NICHD,"TRANSCENDENT INTERNATIONAL, LLC",R44,2010,109026,0.02693819907682414
"University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  To improve our overall academic environment, the RISE program was initiated in 1998 to prepare students to become scientists. As part of this long-term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in three areas: (1) their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, (2) their limited research skills and experience, and (3) limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, four developmental activities are prescribed--visiting scientists, research skills, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators both at UPR Cayey and at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 40 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the U.S. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: (1) research and language skills with on-campus faculty mentors, (2) motivational visiting scientists, and (3) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the U.S. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPR Cayey alumni who will be biomedical research scientists.      During the last 8 years, 20 MBRS alumni completed Ph.D.s and 40 alumni began their Ph.D. studies. By doubling the number of alumni entering doctoral programs, RISE will impact the community. These UPR Cayey scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases.          ",University of Puerto Rico at Cayey-RISE Program,7813887,R25GM059429,"['Hand ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Internships ', ' Island ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' English Language ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Oral ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' Bibliography ', ' Visit ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' publication formats ', ' Comprehension ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PR CAYEY UNIVERSITY COLL,R25,2010,383551,0.0025883704558276825
"Disparities in Labor Analgesia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this postdoctoral fellowship will be to facilitate the candidate's development as a leader in health services research focused on healthcare disparities in the quality of care delivered to minority populations. Building on her background in obstetric anesthesiology and public health, the candidate proposes to develop additional skills during the award period through 1) coursework designed to expand her methodological skills; 2) interaction with a multidisciplinary team of sponsors and collaborators, including those in health services research (Dr. Romana Hasnain-Wynia), obstetrics (Dr. William Grobman), and anesthesiology (Dr. Cynthia Wong); and 3) a series of supervised research projects. The overall objective of these projects is to identify patient and provider factors that can be targeted for interventions at reducing disparities in labor analgesia utilization. This will be accomplished through three specific aims: (1) to assess the effect of race/ethnicity on labor and delivery providers' (anesthesiologist, obstetrician, nursing) analgesic recommendations using clinical vignettes, (2) to evaluate labor and delivery providers' (anesthesiologist, obstetrician, nursing) attitudes, beliefs, and practices regarding labor analgesia in patients of differing races/ethnicities through semi-structured interviews, and (3) to identify key patient factors associated with the decision to utilize epidural labor analgesia through semi-structured interviews. These projects, in conjunction with the chosen coursework and mentorship interactions, will allow the candidate to become proficient in qualitative and statistical methodology. Towards the end of the award period, the candidate plans to develop a career development award that will propose to: 1) design an educational intervention for patients to help educate them about labor analgesic options, its risks, and benefits; and 2) develop an educational tool for labor and delivery providers to help educate them about providing equitable care to women from diverse racial/ethnic/cultural backgrounds regarding their options for labor analgesia. This project will meet the mission of the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research by helping to improve the quality of healthcare for all Americans by ensuring that the care we are delivering is equitable.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and ethnic disparities resulting in inadequate treatment of pain in minority populations are a significant public health problem and a quality of care issue.

"Academic Career Award in Complementary and Alternative Medicine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NCCAM's 2005 Strategic Plan includes the exploration of organized health care delivery models which integrate complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) with conventional care. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey reports that approximately one in five adults use Herbs and non-vitamin Dietary Supplements (HDS). However, little is known about the number of inpatients in urban underserved hospitals who continue to use HDS while receiving treatment with allopathic medicines. Similarly, little is known about factors associated with potential HDS adverse events in hospital settings. Health information technology holds promise as an innovative and effective way to deliver HDS information to underserved patients and their physicians. This K07 application proposes essential first steps toward (1) developing a solid knowledge base about HDS use in underserved hospital patients, and (2) designing and piloting innovative methods to effectively deliver evidenced-based HDS information to underserved inpatients and their physicians, in particular through health information technology. The research objectives of this application are: (1) to contribute to the knowledge base about HDS use among minority inpatients; (2) to design culturally sensitive literacy-informed patient-centered information technology systems to teach about HDS; and (3) to develop a patient safety curriculum that will help clinicians document HDS use and communicate effectively with their patients about HDS. To achieve these objectives, this K07 application has three specific aims: (1) Investigate the association between HDS use, health literacy, medication use, and hospital utilization in a sample of 750 hospitalized patients; (2) Conduct a randomized clinical trial in sixty women who will receive a hospitalized discharge plan on cranberry delivered by a virtual patient advocate (a computerized, animated, empathic character), and a control group who receives the same information via a cranberry patient information sheet; and (3) Design, program, and evaluate a web-based HDS patient safety curriculum for clinicians, then utilize pre and post measures and chart reviews to assess its impact on clinician-patient HDS communication. Completion of this research will be supported by: (1) a core of highly skilled mentors and consultants; and (2) completion of a Graduate Certificate in Instructional Technology at the Boston University School of Education. The candidate's career goals are to become (1) an independent HDS research investigator and educator for underserved populations, and (2) a national leader in the use of health information technology for HDS patient and clinician education. To prepare herself to accomplish these career goals, as well as the research objectives outlined above, the candidate proposes (1) to undertake mentored training in patient safety, health care disparities, health literacy, and epidemiologic methods, and (2) to pursue course-working clinical trial design, statistical analysis, human subject protections, and online curriculum development.

"Tense and Agreement in SAAE and SWE by Dialect Density and SLI Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the work is to examine the tense and agreement systems of children with and without specific language impairment (SLI) in Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). Although strides have been made in the study of SLI in SAAE and SWE, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of these dialects, and of the manifestations of SLI within them. These gaps in the literature create barriers to the representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this impedes the development of valid and efficient clinical services for children who speak these dialects. The focus of the work is on tense and agreement because recent findings from our lab and others indicate that nonstandard English-speaking children with SLI present difficulties with this aspect of language when compared to same dialect-speaking controls. These findings are consistent with two linguistic theories of SLI, the Extended Optional Infinitive account (EOI; Rice & Wexler, 1996; Rice, Wexler & Cleave, 1995) and the Feature-based Limited Functional Category account (F-LFC; Hegarty, 2005). Within the proposed work, we will further evaluate and specify the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE and complete four tests of the EOI and F-LFC models. The four tests involve: 1) the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE; 2) the nature of the tense and agreement systems of typically developing children who vary in their nonstandard dialect use; 3) the relation between measures of children's tense and agreement systems and their general language ability, cognition, and environment; and 4) the relation between children's overt marking of tense and agreement and their overt marking of other functional categories (negation, complementizers) within an utterance. For the first three tests, the models make similar predictions but for the fourth, the models make different predictions. To achieve these goals, we will complete one large-scale study of 240 children in eight participant groups. These groups will allow us to compare same-dialect speaking children with and without SLI to each other (Test 1); evaluate differences between groups of typically developing children who produce low, medium, and high densities of SAAE and SWE (Test 2); complete regression analyses (Test 3); and complete a functional category analysis of utterances that contain tense and agreement, negation, and complementizers (Test 4). The data will come from language samples, standardized testing, and experimental probes as has been done in studies of standard English. However, to adequately evaluate the children's language systems and test the predictions of the EOI and F-LFC models within SAAE and SWE, we will create dialect-appropriate stimuli and dialect-appropriate coding systems. Findings from the work will lead to improved clinical services for children and a reduction of the health disparities that exist in the rural Deep South and elsewhere. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South. The proposed studies seek to learn more about children within these communities by focusing on the grammatical profile of SLI within Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). The findings should lead to a better understanding of the SLI grammar profile within these dialects while also providing four tests of two linguistic models of SLI. These findings should result in greater representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this should lead to improved clinical services and a reduction of health disparities for children who live in the rural Deep South and elsewhere.

"Heart Failure Clinical Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The proposed Heart Failure Regional Clinical Center (HF-RCC) application provides a unique opportunity to access practicing physicians as well as rural and minority outreach to support heart failure research and education. The network is an academic - community physicians partnership pioneered by the Morehouse School of Medicine Community Physicians' Network (CRN), to promote clinical research and practice based quality improvement. The network allows seamless integration of NIH supported clinical protocols at the community practice level. The HF RCC builds up on this model by bringing together the largest Cardiology group practice, in North Atlanta, known in the southeast USA for leading edge practice and research with 2 of the largest and oldest minority owned Cardiology practices in the South Metro Atlanta and surrounding rural communities. The extraordinary geographic reach of the network, its socioeconomic and ethnic diversity is evident from the Heart Failure Registry database, a summary of which is included with this application. Finally, the affiliations with St. Joseph's Hospital and Grady Hospital, large tertiary care centers, respectively known nationally for award winning cardiovascular care and outstanding care delivery to the underserved, provide unprecedented opportunity and credibility to impact cardiovascular care and health disparities. The longstanding mission of MSM to promote equitable care for all is the ultimate engine and passion that drives the network. Indeed participating practices and hospitals have cited this commitment as a key motivator for their interest in the Community Physicians' Network. We have proposed an infrastructure based on our experience and expertise in recruiting and retaining difficult to reach patient populations. The two projects provide an opportunity to fully exploit the intellectual and infrastructure capacity of the Network. Both projects capitalize on the size of the Heart Failure patient population in our RCC, as well as expertise of investigators. Project one draws upon our research interest in remodeling in hypertensive heart disease and heart failure, and also takes advantage of our group's interest in the role of   NO in cardiac and vascular remodeling. The second project is largely based on the expertise of our   collaborator, Nicholas Chronos, MD in cell based therapies in preclinical and early phase clinical trials. The proposed clinical skills development core integrates existing clinical training resource such as the   successful Master of Science in Clinical Research Program at MSM and the sought after cardiovascular   research training program at St. Joseph's Research Institute. In summary, we have proposed a very unique application which should serve as a model for future collaborative research networks that seek to actively engage and integrate community practices, a key stated goals of the NIH to map initiative.

"Hospital Care Environment, Neighborhood, and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are well-documented racial and ethnic disparities in the costly and often preventable outcomes of mortality, readmission, and prolonged hospitalization due to the common conditions of heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction. The causes and solutions for these disparities, however, are not clear. Evidence has begun to point toward differences in the hospitals where most minorities and non- minorities receive care as a source of disparities. Surprisingly, two important factors and their interrelationship, which may explain how hospital differences are associated with disparities and point to opportunities for targeted intervention, have received insufficient attention: the quality of nursing in the hospital in which patients are cared for and the characteristics of the neighborhoods of patients served by different hospitals. Nurses  provide vital bedside care, 24/7 surveillance, education, and care coordination that may narrow disparity gaps,  but little is known about the degree to which minority patients are treated in hospitals with lower quality nursing  and the effect of these differences on disparities. Nursing as a systems factor is an appealing feature to study because unlike many hospital characteristics, it can be improved through intervention by administrators or policymakers. Evidence suggests that most minority older adults are cared for in a relatively small proportion of hospitals. The quality of the nursing care environment (including nurse staffing level, level of nurse education, and a care environment supportive of professional nursing practice) can vary significantly from hospital to hospital and these factors affect patient outcomes. If differences in nursing care environment are shown to be associated with disparities, strategies targeting nursing in hospitals that predominantly serve minority- populations could be implemented.  We must also consider that outcomes variation by hospital may reflect differences in the populations that different hospitals treat. Although researchers often account for differences in individual characteristics, the effect of the hospital environment is rarely examined in relation to the effect of the neighborhood where patients live. Research shows that the socio-ecological qualities of an older adult's neighborhood (e.g., socioeconomic position, segregation, and primary care services availability) impact health outcomes. In addition to an independent effect, we expect that neighborhood factors affect older adults' access to high-quality hospital services including quality nursing care. We will use multilevel and cross-classified models as well as geographic information systems (GIS) methods to examine unique survey data from hospital nurses along with Medicare claims data that is geocoded and linked with neighborhood data.  Our approach will allow us to untangle the interrelated effects of the hospital care environment and patient neighborhood on racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes among older adults, point to interventions that may reverse disparities, and identify communities and hospitals that can most benefit from interventions.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes for older adults are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By examining the inter-related effects of the  hospital care environment and the neighborhoods from which hospitals draw patients, our study will help  explain previously unexplored causes of racial and ethnic disparities, inform efforts to improve the hospital care  environment, and target limited resources to the hospitals and communities that could most benefit from them.              Racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes for older adults are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care.

"Comparing language profiles of AAE-speaking children in poverty to those with SLI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children reared in poverty and those diagnosed with language impairments both perform poorly on standardized measures of language. Yet, the cause of poor performance for the groups is considered quite different, limited experiences and/or test bias as compared to faulty language systems. Further complicating the research is the fact that children from low-income backgrounds often speak a nonmainstream dialect. The goal of the current work is to address these issues by differentiating the language profiles of children from low- income backgrounds and those diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in narrowly defined groups. To accomplish this, we will evaluate past tense marking in four groups of African American English (AAE)-speaking children: 6-year old children from low-income backgrounds, their typically developing age- matched peers from middle income backgrounds, their typically developing language-matched peers from middle income backgrounds, and their typically developing age-matched peers diagnosed with SLI. The children's language abilities will be evaluated using spontaneous language sampling and established protocols for past tense and passive marking. Comparing group performance on these grammatical measures will further test whether the two groups demonstrate general language difficulties or more specific language difficulties (e.g., grammar or vocabulary). Such outcomes will contribute to advances in understanding individual variation across language profiles, further enhancing our diagnostic accuracy of SLI.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities exist for children reared in poverty. The goal of the proposed studies is to uncover the effects of poverty on language in a group of African American children from low-income families and those diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment.

"Biophysical Measure To Predict Pressure Ulcers In Nursing Home Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will test the validity of a non-visual assessment strategy for stage I pressure ulcers (PUs) among nursing home (NH) residents with light or dark skin tones using a multi-site, longitudinal cohort design. PUs are common, often preventable, and costly; detection of early-stage PUs is important because intervention may prevent decline to more severe PUs. The standard method of detection, visual skin assessment for non- blanchable erythema, is somewhat reliable for individuals with light skin tones but detects changes after skin damage has already occurred. In addition, visual skin assessment fails to detect skin color changes in persons with darkly pigmented skin. Documented health disparities between African Americans and Caucasians for incidence of stage I PUs and prevention intervention may be related to deficiencies in detection. In our prior studies, we showed that a hand-held device that assesses sub-epidermal moisture (SEM), a measure of edema from inflammatory changes in the tissues, identified stage I PUs. Further, SEM was higher (e.g., increased edema and inflammation) when there was no visible skin damage at the time but a stage I PU was visible on the skin one week later; SEM values predicted 26 percent of the subsequent stage I PUs. Findings were similar in a small sub-sample of NH residents with dark skin tones. We propose to test the validity of this innovative approach to detecting PUs, particularly focusing on residents with dark skin tones; to test threshold SEM values for detecting stage I PUs and detecting progression of stage I PUs to stage II+ PUs. We will recruit 389 NH residents, 62 of whom will have dark skin tones, who are at risk for PU based on the Minimum Data Set Assessment from 24 NHs. Visual skin assessments and blinded SEM measures will be completed by research staff at least weekly for consented residents for 4 months. Skin tone of NH residents will be assessed using color tiles rather than by proxy measures of ethnicity as in previous research. In addition, participant demographics, MDS assessment data on functional level, and comorbid medical conditions will be obtained from medical record review. Risk assessments using the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sores will be collected at baseline. Generalized ordered logistic modeling, appropriately modeling the repeated observations and time-dependent measures, will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of SEM measures to identify future skin damage. Measurement of SEM represents a potentially important tool for decreasing the disparity of prevention interventions between persons with different skin tones. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement to Public Health This project is the next step in the evaluation of a new assessment technique for bedsores, a common problem for nursing home residents. If this measurement can identify skin damage at an earlier stage to allow prompt intervention, evidence will be powerful for evaluating its use through a clinical trial. In addition, replacing methods of assessing skin damage that rely on skin color changes has the potential of reducing the severity of skin damage in persons with darkly pigmented skin, leading to reduction in observed health disparities and equalizing the chance of detecting damage at a point when prevention practices can be most effective.           Relevance Statement to Public Health This project is the next step in the evaluation of a new assessment technique for bedsores, a common problem for nursing home residents.

"Estimating Hospital Outcome Quality: Applications to Pay-for-Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will pursue two major areas of research related to quality measurement and payment policy reform to improve value in healthcare. The first pertains to the evaluation and design of estimators of outcome quality and cost in order to profile the performance of healthcare providers. This research will evaluate the performance of existing estimators of outcome performance, propose new estimators, and validate the performance of these estimators to profile the quality, cost, and efficiency of hospitals and physician practices. The second area of research I will pursue is an evaluation of the Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) hospital-based pay-for-performance (P4P) program. I will test the effect of the P4P program on quality and cost for the areas incentivized in the program (maternity and newborn care, community acquired pneumonia, surgical infection prevention, pediatric asthma). I will also estimate the effect of the program on racial and ethnic disparities. To evaluate the performance of outcome measures, a simulation model will be constructed and a series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments will be designed and implemented. The basic approach is as follows: hypothetical providers are randomly assigned a ""true"" outcome score, a performance improvement trajectory, a patient risk score, a sample size, and a sample size trajectory. A random shock, inversely associated with sample size, is then created for each provider. Observed outcome scores, derived as a function of true outcome quality, patient risk, and the random shock are created for each hospital. Using only information on observed outcomes, true outcomes are then estimated using the candidate outcome estimators and the performance of these estimators is compared. The performance of these estimators will then be validated for hospitals and physicians using national Medicare data and data from Massachusetts. To evaluate the effect of the MassHealth program on quality, costs, and racial and ethnic disparities, I will draw on methods employed in my previous research. This will involve the use of panel data econometric techniques to test whether Massachusetts hospitals increased quality and decreased cost for MassHealth patients after the program was implemented. To examine the effect of the program on disparities, I will test for reductions in both within-hospital disparities in quality and between-hospital disparities in quality after the program was implemented. The skills and knowledge required to pursue my proposed research will be bolstered by an outstanding group of mentors and a robust education and career development plan. My mentors are leaders in the fields of payment and financing of healthcare, quality measurement, organizational research, health economics, and comparative effectiveness. Further, my mentors employ insights and perspectives from economics, political science, sociology, and clinical practice in their research, providing a rich and diverse intellectual environment from which I can draw upon as a mentee. In following my career development plan, I will enhance my methodological and programming skills, learn more about the responsible conduct of research, acquire knowledge of clinical practice and medical organization, and present my research findings and interact with colleagues at several national conferences. Research that successfully fulfills the aims of my K01 proposal will have important policy relevance. The proposed research will add to our knowledge about the use of outcome measures in pay-for-performance and public quality reporting while also providing further evidence about the effectiveness of pay-for- performance through the evaluation of the Massachusetts program. While ambitious, my track record of research achievement shows that I am capable of conducting research that achieves these aims. Further, the coursework and applied research conducted for the K01 will augment my research skills, enhancing my ability to achieve these aims. After collaborating with my mentors on this research, I will be have established myself as a researcher in the fields of P4P and quality measurement, positioning myself for R01 grants in these areas.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project has the potential to positively impact public health by creating more accurate estimators of healthcare provider outcome quality and cost and by contributing to the understanding of the effect of hospital-based pay-for-performance. This research can be used to design payment policy that creates stronger incentives for value and quality improvement in healthcare.              Project Narrative The proposed project has the potential to positively impact public health by creating more accurate estimators of healthcare provider outcome quality and cost and by contributing to the understanding of the effect of hospital-based pay-for-performance.

"Role of English Fluency in Spanish Neuropsychological Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies primarily emanating from the cognitive science literature suggest both advantages and disadvantages of bilingualism for cognitive performance. The Interference Hypothesis suggests that while interacting in two languages (e.g., English and Spanish), bilinguals' capacity to communicate in one language decreases as a function of the second language interfering in their language-based cognitive processes. The Inhibitory Control Model, a refinement of this hypothesis, states that bilinguals must suppress the non-target language to allow production of the intended language. This constant experience with linguistic conflict resolution can be seen as practice of executive and attentional control, thus predicting a bilingual advantage on tasks requiring these abilities. While most of the work in bilingual neuro-cognition has been conducted using such cognitive science paradigms, often with college students, translation Into competent healthcare for linguistically diverse groups requires understanding how these performance predictions fit into an applied neuropsychology work frame, such as would be used when delivering care, and with a broader demographic representation. Given that Spanish speakers in the U.S. vary in English fluency, it is important to understand how this second language fluency affects neuropsychological (NP) performance in the first language. This has implications for the interpretation of test results when diagnosing brain dysfunction in bilingual patients. To this end, the proposed study will examine the effects of English fluency on Spanish language neuropsychological test performance hypothesizing relationships derived from existing cognitive science models. In addition, it will explore whether bilingual advantages observed in our preliminary data are explained by socioeconomic and acculturation differences between bilinguals and monolinguals. Finally, in order to understand the clinical significance of these potential performance differences, the proposed study will examine whether clinically meaningful bilingual advantages are observed in HIV+ individuals, a patient population in whom brain dysfunction is common. Participants will be 80 healthy HIV- men and women (40 bilingual and 40 demographically comparable monolingual), and 40 bilingual and 40 monolingual HIV+ participants with comparable demographic and disease characteristics. All will be native Spanish speakers of Mexican descent. Bilingualism will be determined based on a language preference questionnaire as well as objective measures of verbal fluency in each language. Participants will receive neuropsychological and psychosocial assessments. The knowledge gained will help to bridge health disparities in the competent neuropsychological assessment of diverse populations. My most direct goal will be to carry out the research plan proposed in this application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this type of research is to inform the development of valid ways to assess cognitive functioning in culturally and linguistically diverse populations. This will result in better quality of care across the spectrum of brain diseases, as such that caused by HIV. Understanding the ways in which socio-demographic characteristics impact cognition should ultimately, and ideally, not only affect the construction of assessment instruments but also point a direction in public policy toward maximizing the possibilities of an enriched developmental environment for people living under disadvantaged conditions. As a long-term goal Dr. Cherner and I would like to extend the already emerging international work of the   HNRC by setting up collaborations with other Latin American countries, to study the impact of neuro AIDS and associated conditions such as toxoplasmosis in different regions. My hope is that we can disseminate the knowledge obtained here in the U.S. Dr. to various countries in Latin America. Dr. Cherner, being a native of Argentina, and I, being a native of Colombia, make this goal a plausible one. It is my long term goal as a scientist and professor of a University in the United States that to one day I will be able to disseminate culturally appropriate assessment tools in developing countries were the need is great but resources are limited.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My most direct goal will be to carry out the research plan proposed in this application.

"Tense and Agreement in SAAE and SWE by Dialect Density and SLI Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the work is to examine the tense and agreement systems of children with and without specific language impairment (SLI) in Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). Although strides have been made in the study of SLI in SAAE and SWE, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of these dialects, and of the manifestations of SLI within them. These gaps in the literature create barriers to the representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this impedes the development of valid and efficient clinical services for children who speak these dialects. The focus of the work is on tense and agreement because recent findings from our lab and others indicate that nonstandard English-speaking children with SLI present difficulties with this aspect of language when compared to same dialect-speaking controls. These findings are consistent with two linguistic theories of SLI, the Extended Optional Infinitive account (EOI; Rice & Wexler, 1996; Rice, Wexler & Cleave, 1995) and the Feature-based Limited Functional Category account (F-LFC; Hegarty, 2005). Within the proposed work, we will further evaluate and specify the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE and complete four tests of the EOI and F-LFC models. The four tests involve: 1) the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE; 2) the nature of the tense and agreement systems of typically developing children who vary in their nonstandard dialect use; 3) the relation between measures of children's tense and agreement systems and their general language ability, cognition, and environment; and 4) the relation between children's overt marking of tense and agreement and their overt marking of other functional categories (negation, complementizers) within an utterance. For the first three tests, the models make similar predictions but for the fourth, the models make different predictions. To achieve these goals, we will complete one large-scale study of 240 children in eight participant groups. These groups will allow us to compare same-dialect speaking children with and without SLI to each other (Test 1); evaluate differences between groups of typically developing children who produce low, medium, and high densities of SAAE and SWE (Test 2); complete regression analyses (Test 3); and complete a functional category analysis of utterances that contain tense and agreement, negation, and complementizers (Test 4). The data will come from language samples, standardized testing, and experimental probes as has been done in studies of standard English. However, to adequately evaluate the children's language systems and test the predictions of the EOI and F-LFC models within SAAE and SWE, we will create dialect-appropriate stimuli and dialect-appropriate coding systems. Findings from the work will lead to improved clinical services for children and a reduction of the health disparities that exist in the rural Deep South and elsewhere. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South. The proposed studies seek to learn more about children within these communities by focusing on the grammatical profile of SLI within Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). The findings should lead to a better understanding of the SLI grammar profile within these dialects while also providing four tests of two linguistic models of SLI. These findings should result in greater representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this should lead to improved clinical services and a reduction of health disparities for children who live in the rural Deep South and elsewhere.           Health Impact Statement  Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South.

"Association between clinical decision support systems and health care disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health Information Technology (HIT) has been recommended as a means to lower health care costs, improve quality, and promote patient safety. One element of Health Information Technology that has helped improve quality of care is clinical decision support systems (CDSS). The proposed dissertation research will investigate the degree to which increased use of CDSS may contribute to reducing racial and rural/urban health quality disparities. Differences in process and outcome quality indicators will be studied by examining acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and pneumonia patients within hospitals with and without CDSS. Black and Hispanic patients have been shown to receive lower recommended care for these two conditions, and as a result suffer poorer health outcomes. Moreover, rural residents have been shown to receive lower recommended care for AMI as compared to their urban counterparts. This dissertation advances prior research by examining the potential for HIT systems, namely CDSS, to reduce disparities in processes of care by supporting adherence to clinical guidelines. Previous research has been limited by small, single-institution studies and selection biases; therefore, this dissertation will use national datasets along with propensity scores and multilevel models to examine the true treatment effect on reducing health disparities by CDSS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrating health information technology research with examinations of healthcare quality offers an innovative direction for addressing disparities in care based on race and residence. The work proposed here will focus on the associations between use of CDSS to support evidence-based medicine and (1) hospital adherence to clinical guidelines and health outcomes as measured by Hospital Compare from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) and (2) outcome quality disparities for vulnerable patients as measured by the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Policy makers will be able to use the results of this study to strengthen the case for fully functional electronic medical record (EMR) systems that include clinical decision support systems (CDSS).              Integrating health information technology research with examinations of healthcare quality offers an innovative direction for addressing disparities in care based on race and residence.

"Nurse Practice Environment Influences in Reducing Disparities In Hospital Outcome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to prepare Margo Brooks Carthon, PhD, RN, for an independent health services research career, with a special focus on disparities research. The career development plan entails three approaches to achieve the immediate and long-term career goals of the candidate, including 1) completion of training dedicated to acquiring skills in advanced health outcomes research methods and statistics; 2) enlistment of an expert mentorship team including Dr. Linda Aiken, PhD, FAAN, RN, Dr. Herbert Smith and Dr. David Barton Smith and 3) the conduct of a study to evaluate the influence of nurse practice environments on hospital outcomes of minority patients, that will lead to future R-series grant applications. I have an offer for a faculty position from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing upon the completion of my post-doctoral research fellowship. The research project seeks to understand how characteristics of the nurse work force and the nurse practice environment influence outcomes among hospitalized minority patients. This study will employ a cross sectional, observational design to determine the effects of nurse work force and the practice environment on selected patient outcomes in order to assess what types of investments in nursing resources might be most beneficial to minority patient outcomes. The specific aims of the research project are to: 1) examine the difference in post operative mortality and failure to rescue rates among minority and non-minority patients, and determine how much of the differences in minority patient outcomes are explained by underlying patient characteristics such as comorbidites or characteristics of the hospitals where minorities seek care; and 2) determine to what extent differences in minority patient post surgical outcomes are associated with nurse staffing, the proportion of nurses with BSN education, and the quality of the nurse practice environment. It is anticipated that the results of the study will inform managerial and policy initiatives on how to improve health outcomes, particularly in hospitals serving a large proportion of minorities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal directly addresses the public health concern regarding disparities in health outcomes among hospitalized racial and ethnic minorities. Its results will represent one of the first initiatives to evaluate the influence of nursing care and the practice environment on minority patient outcomes and will provide a preliminary assessment of what kinds of investments in nursing are most beneficial.        This proposal directly addresses the public health concern regarding disparities in health outcomes among hospitalized racial and ethnic minorities.

"Understanding Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many studies have documented important racial disparities in surgical outcomes but their etiologies are not clear. While we generally find better surgical outcomes (lower mortality) at teaching hospitals, and a higher rate of minority patients at these hospitals, the survival benefit at teaching hospitals does not seem to equally apply to white and black patients. This application will explore why we observe disparities in three common surgical specialties that are performed throughout most hospitals where surgery is practiced: general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery. The application will focus on a classic measure of surgical practice - the procedure time. While always available on chart review, the ability to study surgical procedure time on a vast scale with Medicare claims is new. Anesthesiologists began billing Medicare by the minute in 1994. Using these bills to estimate procedure length in a population of Pennsylvania patients, we have recently published that there was a significant and clinically important disparity in the length of operations based on race and income, after detailed adjustment for patient characteristics and procedure type. This disparity was greatest at hospitals with residency programs, where the procedure time of black patients in the lowest third of the income distribution was on average 31 minutes longer than that of white patients at the same level of income (P<0.0001). In non-resident hospitals the mean gap was 8 minutes (P<0.0001). In further work we have shown that the disparity in procedure length gets larger with longer procedure times (at the 95 percentile using quantile regression, the difference between blacks and whites is about 3 of an hour). Furthermore, in our examination of all teaching and non-teaching hospitals in the state of Pennsylvania, the 15 hospitals with the largest number of black patients undergoing orthopedic and general surgery, excess adjusted procedure time (black-white by hospital) was statistically significant in 5 of 15 hospitals, with their mean excess times ranging from 9 to 16 minutes. The strength of using operative time as a measure of disparity is that it reflects precisely what the surgical and anesthesia team have done, and is not confounded by patient compliance or preferences, as some other measures of process and outcome may be. This application aims: (1) To study and describe racial and income/SES disparity in procedure time across surgeons and hospitals; (2) To identify the determinants of disparity in procedure time across surgeons and hospitals. We will study those geographic, hospital, and surgeon characteristics associated with the greatest disparities in procedure time; and (3) To make practical recommendations to departments of surgery regarding procedure length and to create models to allow surgery departments to practically monitor such disparities in order to develop mechanisms to eliminate problems if found.  Project Narrative Minority Medicare patients undergoing surgery often have worse outcomes and longer procedure times than whites with comparable comorbidities and procedures. This project aims to understand this disparity between minority and white Americans undergoing surgery through studying disparities in procedure time.",Understanding Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes,8132951,R01AG032963,"['bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' time use ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Residencies ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Familiarity ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Low income ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Consent ', ' medical specialist ', ' Reporting ', ' base ', ' Testing ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outcome ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Training ', ' Infection ', ' Minority ', ' tool ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Measures ', ' Patients ', ' Age ', ' Characteristics ', ' experience ', ' Recommendation ', ' Area ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Physicians ', ' Time ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Belief ', ' Methods ', ' Clinical ', ' Schedule ', ' operation ', ' Hospitals ', ' primary outcome ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Population ', ' Literature ', ' United States ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Risk ', ' Training Programs ', ' Measurement ', ' Modeling ', ' Site ', ' Length ', ' Societies ', ' Shoulder ', ' Monitor ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' indexing ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Policies ', ' Provider ', ' Elements ', ' Awareness ', ' Work ', ' Institutes ', ' theories ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Caring ', ' Link ', ' Beds ', ' Categories ', ' Procedures ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Paper ', ' Writing ', ' Individual ', ' Data ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Archives ', ' Publishing ', ' social ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Communication ', ' Probability ', ' news ', ' Hospital Sizes ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Malpractice ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' General Practices ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Board Certification ', ' Medicare claim ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Teaching Hospitals ', ' Litigation ', ' Trust ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Income Distributions ', ' Censuses ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Process Measure ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' income insurance ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' surgery specialty ', ' Surgical Profession ', ' Surgical Specialties ', ' ']",NIA,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2011,515033,0.0429236042925038
"Nursing Impact on Care Outcomes for Chronically Ill and Minority Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nursing Impact on Care Outcomes for Chronically Ill and Minority Patients This revised competing continuation (R01NR04513) extends a highly successful program of research that has influenced changes in practice and policy, and stimulated global interest in nursing outcomes research. We extend our work on the significant association between preventable hospitals deaths and the organizational context of nursing care into new domains of theoretical relevance and substantive interest, new patient populations, and new outcomes. We have documented in our current work significant increases in chronic health conditions among people seeking hospital care for acute medical illnesses such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute congestive heart failure, and for general surgery, reflecting changes in population health. We will determine whether nursing factors are particularly important for preventing adverse outcomes during hospitalization for these at-risk patients. Our greatest interest is in three conditions that are increasing significantly among hospitalized patients and have important implications for nursing care: obesity, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary disease. We look not only at the outcomes for individual patients with these underlying chronic conditions. We also examine whether the outcomes for patients without chronic conditions are poorer in hospitals with higher concentrations of patients with these particular chronic conditions. All else being equal, we expect that non-chronic patients in hospitals with high concentrations of chronic patients may not benefit as much from better nurse staffing and care environments as similar patients in hospitals with lower concentrations of chronic patients because nurses in the former hospitals devote relatively more attention to those at risk of poor outcomes but are not likely to be better staffed. Similarly, we turn our attention to racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes to test whether poorer outcomes for minorities are explained by a combination of multiple underlying chronic health conditions and the concentration of minorities in hospitals with poor nurse staffing and education and less satisfactory care environments. Surprisingly the large literature on health disparities rarely considers how nursing might be a factor that explains poor outcomes, which is a necessary step to understanding whether improving nurse staffing and care environments is likely to contribute to reducing disparities in hospital outcomes. The findings have implications for nurse staffing standards and hospital payment, particularly for minority-serving hospitals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in population health, including sharp increases in chronic conditions, contribute to the complexity of hospital care and increase the risk for poor outcomes. Disparities in hospital outcomes by race and ethnicity persist. This study examines whether improving nursing resources in hospitals would be a potentially effective strategy to improve outcomes in these overlapping populations.             Changes in population health, including sharp increases in chronic conditions, contribute to the complexity of  hospital care and increase the risk for poor outcomes.

"Mechanisms for Enhancing Scholarly Achievements (MESA)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms for Enhancing Scholarly Achievements (MESA)  Abstract  The purpose of this randomized, controlled prospective-cohort-longitudinal study is to increase  understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the transition of a diverse group of Academic Health  Science Center graduate students who are enrolled in clinical programs of study (medicine, nursing,  dentistry, allied health, and public health) into planned pursuit of a clinical research scientist career. The framework for this initial test of an integrated series of interventions designed to build interdisciplinary research teams has a cognitive learning theory assumptive base specifying intra-person and organization resources that make it possible to reach desired scholarly achievement goals despite exposure to learning anxiety and uncertainty that accompanies entry into a team science learning frame. The theory informed  intervention strategies incorporate the following elements:  "" Motivation direction and strength interventions to foster the development of personal research   career goals;  "" Faculty and community mentor pool that link student participation with an interdisciplinary   research team;  "" Research team building support to promote collaboration and healthy competition;  "" Individual capacity building essential cognitive skills (problem solving, cognitive reframing, delay   in gratification and belief in self relative to research self-efficacy);  "" Participation across five semesters in team-based research projects directed toward health   promotion/restoration for persons from vulnerable populations;  "" A scholars' seminar series (across five semesters) focused on essential research content and   proficiencies.  Five aims and 10 linked hypotheses address a test of outcomes and modeling of the proposed learning process that begins with Motivator Direction and Strength and ends with Scholarly Activity and Career Path plan.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about the factors that influence the pursuit of a research career by minority persons. The proposed study will add to what is known about key elements, the mechanisms, which promote the achievement of successful research careers of minority persons who are returning for a graduate degree in medicine, nursing, dentistry, allied health and public health. The potential impact of having evidence  supported interventions that demonstrate the ability to increase the number of minority clinical  researchers is the potential to more quickly and efficiently to produce a research workforce that better  addresses the health needs of vulnerable populations.

"Cross-Language Outcomes of Bilingual Experience in Typical and Atypical Developme    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population. Identification of language impairment (SLI) and careful description of its trajectory during the school-age years is one area where disparities continue to exist. One population that is currently understudied is the Spanish-English bilingual school population. Significant strides have been made in the identification of markers of language impairment in young bilingual (Spanish-English) children. There are emerging strategies and instruments that guide identification of true impairment vs. language differences in this population (e.g., Gutiirrez-Clellen, Restrepo, & Simon-Cereijido, 2006; Gutiirrez-Clellen & Simon-Cereijido, 2007). There is also more detail about the kinds of language changes that bilingual children make in their two languages as they transition from the home to the school language (Hammer, Lawrence, & Miccio, 2008). A number of studies examine reading outcomes in bilingual children as well. However, there is a lack of systematic longitudinal studies examining the consequences of SLI in bilingual children. Spanish speakers are the largest language minority in the US and they make up 79 percent of the school age limited English speaking population. During the school age years children need to move quickly from basic conversational skills in English to development of academic language skills. Yet, during the early second language acquisition, performance in each language is highly variable, demonstrated by inconsistent levels of fluency across each language (Bialystok, 2001). ELL children with SLI are at higher risk for low educational and linguistic outcomes. The higher risk comes from at least two major sources: (1) lack of English proficiency that limits academic access; and (2) their language impairment that puts them at-risk for other academic difficulties. We propose to examine developmental outcomes in three domains (phonology/phonotactics, vocabulary/semantics, morphosyntax) in bilingual children at three ability levels (SLI, typical developing-at risk, typically developing). This project has two main phases. In phase 1 we focus on risk for language impairment as a function of Spanish/English exposure and use patterns across three grades (preschool, first grade, and third). In phase 2 a multiple longitudinal design will be employed that will include 4 overlapping cohorts to span the preschool through 5th grade age range. We incorporate processing tasks tied to each domain designed to tap into children's ability to alter processing with experience (i.e., short term learning). Here, we focus on learning trajectories for bilingual children with and without SLI. The results will provide a unique perspective on the linking of development across domains (e.g., phonological skills supporting acquisition of morphosyntactic forms), within and across a bilingual child's languages, as well as how development is modulated by language exposure, impairment, and variations in production processes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population. Identification of language impairment (SLI) and careful description of its trajectory during the school-age years is one area where disparities continue to exist.

We propose to study bilingual children with and without language impairment in order to reduce health disparities. Understanding the relationships among phonology, semantics, and morphosyntax will provide insights about possible supports these children need for making gains in their two languages. Documenting changes in language processing over time in both languages will contribute to the scientific knowledge base about expected trajectories.           One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population.

"TDARS: Translated Document Assembly and Retrieval System (Phase II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, significant disparity exists in the vital healthcare documents being provided to limited English-proficient (LEP) patients. In 2007, a nationwide survey of hospitals by The Joint Commission found that only 50 percent of hospitals had translated informed consent documents. Even then, the translations were often only available in Spanish. Other types of documents were translated even less frequently. Hospitals, with limited budgets for language services, are struggling to allocate resources to create quality, translated documents for their patients. During the 2005 Roundtable on Health Disparity and Information Technology, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Office of Minority Health (OMH) identified a national repository of translated documents as a high priority need to reduce medical errors due to language miscommunication. During Phase I of this grant, we developed and evaluated a new web-accessible platform for documents that demonstrated feasibility in creating, managing, sharing, printing, and speaking documents to patients in foreign languages. This platform, called TDARS (Translated Document Assembly and Retrieval System), allows healthcare organizations to quickly assemble coherent vital healthcare documents, instantly create quality, translated versions that can be printed, and then instruct a computer to read the translated documents to the patients. TDARS offers a high degree of flexibility in customizing documents for each organization, enables documents to be shared among institutions, provides a method to comply with The Joint Commission's document access standards, and can do all this for less than the average cost of translating one document in one language - making a library of documents economically accessible to even the smallest hospitals. During Phase II, our objective is to develop a commercial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product for hospitals and other healthcare organizations offered through a subscription-pricing model. We will expand TDARS to include a core set of documents identified as being of greatest need during our Phase I evaluation, making them available in the languages identified as being most common and challenging nationwide (Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Russian, Arabic, Korean, and Somali). Thirty participating sites will be recruited that represent our target market population of small and medium-sized hospitals.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A national repository of quality, pre-translated documents that can speak the documents to patients could dramatically reduce the disparity of information provided to our limited English proficient patients. Current methods of translating documents are expensive, the quality of translations is inconsistent, and efforts are being duplicated by multiple hospitals.

"Mechanisms for Enhancing Scholarly Achievements (MESA)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms for Enhancing Scholarly Achievements (MESA)  Abstract  The purpose of this randomized, controlled prospective-cohort-longitudinal study is to increase  understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the transition of a diverse group of Academic Health  Science Center graduate students who are enrolled in clinical programs of study (medicine, nursing,  dentistry, allied health, and public health) into planned pursuit of a clinical research scientist career. The framework for this initial test of an integrated series of interventions designed to build interdisciplinary research teams has a cognitive learning theory assumptive base specifying intra-person and organization resources that make it possible to reach desired scholarly achievement goals despite exposure to learning anxiety and uncertainty that accompanies entry into a team science learning frame. The theory informed  intervention strategies incorporate the following elements:  "" Motivation direction and strength interventions to foster the development of personal research   career goals;  "" Faculty and community mentor pool that link student participation with an interdisciplinary   research team;  "" Research team building support to promote collaboration and healthy competition;  "" Individual capacity building essential cognitive skills (problem solving, cognitive reframing, delay   in gratification and belief in self relative to research self-efficacy);  "" Participation across five semesters in team-based research projects directed toward health   promotion/restoration for persons from vulnerable populations;  "" A scholars' seminar series (across five semesters) focused on essential research content and   proficiencies.  Five aims and 10 linked hypotheses address a test of outcomes and modeling of the proposed learning process that begins with Motivator Direction and Strength and ends with Scholarly Activity and Career Path plan.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about the factors that influence the pursuit of a research career by minority persons. The proposed study will add to what is known about key elements, the mechanisms, which promote the achievement of successful research careers of minority persons who are returning for a graduate degree in medicine, nursing, dentistry, allied health and public health. The potential impact of having evidence  supported interventions that demonstrate the ability to increase the number of minority clinical  researchers is the potential to more quickly and efficiently to produce a research workforce that better  addresses the health needs of vulnerable populations.          Project Narrative  Little is known about the factors that influence the pursuit of a research career by minority persons.

"Disparities in Incontinence and Perineal Skin Damage in Nursing Home Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a study of race, ethnic, and socioeconomic (SES) disparities as they relate to the development and management of incontinence, perineal dermatitis (PD), pressure ulcers (PUs) and associated quality of life in older nursing home (NH) residents. Reports of disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage and their management are a serious ethical and clinical concern warranting further investigation. Incontinence, PUs and PD are long-standing, widespread, and costly problems to which race, ethnic and SES disparities may contribute significantly. Annual treatment costs are in the billions of dollars, and each condition is significantly associated with psychological distress, physical discomfort, and lower quality of life. Complications of PUs can be fatal. Reducing health disparities offers a profound opportunity for improving the health of disadvantaged minority populations. Because health outcomes of NH residents and disparities in those outcomes are influenced by multiple factors at the individual, group NH, and community levels before and during a NH stay, investigation to detangle their contributions requires a multi-level approach. Previous studies have focused primarily on individual level resident characteristics or controlled for only a few NH factors; none has used a multi-level, multi-factoral approach. Because of our datasets, we are uniquely able to simultaneously measure factors at the individual, NH, and community levels that are associated with disparities in the development, prevention, and management of fecal and/or urinary incontinence, PD, PUs, and associated quality of life. We will analyze three large population datasets: Minimum Data Set (MDS) records and practitioner orders for all residents of a large, for-profit NH chain, the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) files, and the US Census tract data. In addition, we will compare disparities in these health conditions and management plans in residents of the proprietary set of NHs with those in a set of national for-profit and non-profit NHs using a fourth database of MDS records (without practitioner orders) and OSCAR, and Census data in a multi-level sensitivity analysis. In so doing, we will provide context to our findings and strengthen our ability to make more informed recommendations. Our study will provide the best evidence to date about which of the many possible modifiable factors associated with disparities in these outcomes should be targeted for intervention and ascertain the level of their contribution. Therefore, our findings are critical before interventions aimed at reducing disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage can be undertaken or successful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of differences in the involuntary leakage of urine and stool, associated skin damage, and quality of life that exist because of race, ethnic background, and social and economic status of older nursing home residents. This study will also examine nursing home and community factors that may play a role in the occurrence, prevention, and management of these health problems that greatly reduce physical and psychological well-being.                   This is a study of differences in the involuntary leakage of urine and stool, associated skin damage, and quality  of life that exist because of race, ethnic background, and social and economic status of older nursing home  residents.

"Racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals for coronary heart disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this K08 application is to support Dr loana Popescu to become an independent investigator in the area of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. The application will involve the assimilation of new methodological skills and the analysis of a number of existing health care databases. In support of the application, Dr. Popescu has assembled a team of experienced mentors-Drs. Gary Rosenthal (Department of Internal Medicine), Gerald Rushton (Geography), and Kevin Leicht (Sociology), who bring expertise in complementary methodological areas and who have assisted Dr. Popescu in designing integrated plans for career development and research. The Career Plan includes advanced training in: 1) hierarchical biostatistical modeling and clinical research ethics; 2) the application of spatial analysis and geographic information systems methods in health care; and 3) methods for measuring residential segregation and understanding its sociological roots. These goals will be accomplished through targeted coursework, tutorials, directed readings, and direct research experiences guided by her mentors. The Research Plan will examine the interplay between geography, segregation and health care system factors, in order to build a comprehensive understanding of why black patients are less likely to receive care for acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass surgery in high quality hospitals. The Research Plan includes three incremental aims that capitalize on a number of national data sources, including: Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims files; US Census data; American Hospital Association surveys; the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile; and Dartmouth Atlas health care market data. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between race, proximity to the admitting and to high quality hospitals, and the likelihood of admission to high quality hospitals. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of residential segregation on disparities in admissions to high quality hospitals. Aim 3 will examine the effects of patterns of prior outpatient care on disparities in admission to high quality hospitals and will build Dr. Popescu's fluency in analyzing more complex outpatient physician claims files.              ",Racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals for coronary heart disease,8100198,K08HL095930,"['Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Data Sources ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Geography ', ' Inpatients ', ' residence ', ' Marketing ', ' Censuses ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Distant ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' career ', ' Decision Making ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Bypass ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Housing ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Travel ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Rights ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Data ', ' Funding ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Accounting ', ' base ', ' Methods ', ' Series ', ' Caring ', ' Complex ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Affect ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Modeling ', ' Mentors ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Techniques ', ' Training ', ' Services ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' high risk ', ' experience ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Measurable ', ' Hospitals ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Patients ', ' Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' career development ', ' skills ', ' Clinical ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Individual ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Award ', ' Area ', ' Guidelines ', ' cohort ', ' Goals ', ' Physicians ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Assimilations ', ' Research Ethics ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Sociology ', ' Atlases ', ' Demographic Accounting ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2011,127116,0.04249426073131852
"Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telemedicine can be defined as the delivery of healthcare services to distal locations by electronic connectivity. In recent years, telemedicine has expanded to include a wide range of remotely delivered services, including vital signs monitoring, medication management, ""telepsychiatry"" and others. The increasing utilization of telemedicine is driven by cost and, for distal (""underserved"") regions, a lack of professionals to deliver otherwise unavailable services. This proposal aims to develop a computerized assessment system capable of providing remote, audio-video-based administration of a wide range of commonly applied cognitive test instruments as well as behavioral-psychiatric measures (BPMs), in a similar manner as if the examiner were sitting face-to-face with the subject being evaluated. The proposed Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) will enable qualified clinicians to remotely conduct thorough neuropsychological or psychiatric evaluations of research subjects or patients with a range of acquired brain disorders for which such assessments are routinely applied, including: traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumor, neurotoxicologicalinsult,HIV-relatedencephalopathy,schizophrenia,and Alzheimer's disease. Remote locations broadly include clinical evaluation units at hospitals, managed care facilities, group practice sites, nursing homes, correctional facilities, regional health clinics, and in patient's homes, in both rural and metropolitan areas. The CARES will implement a fundamentally new approach in which a remote examiner views a full-screen, application-specific GUI that provides on- screen controls that will enable an examiner to: control the pace of the test session, repeat and supplement computerized instructions, immediately score verbal report or overt behavior in real time, and pause or terminate a test. Thus, the CARES is well suited for application in impaired populations that commonly require ongoing monitoring and supplemental instruction. Significantly, the CARES is a technological extension of a previously validated, dual-display, computerized assessment system in which the subject is physically accompanied by a human examiner. The GUI for this antecedent system will be adapted to host a high-resolution televideo window that permits an examiner and patient to see and talk to each other, establishing high-quality ""telepresence"", which is especially important for the administration of tests or BPMs involving subjective impressions or judgement of overt behavior. Accordingly, the CARES approach contrasts sharply with available, web-based assessments that are not only unaccompanied by an examiner, but suffer from rigid administration procedures, as well as multiple technical shortcomings, that significantly limit the range of test instruments that can be reliably administered to impaired individuals. In Phase II, the main objectives are to: 1) develop an application- optimized, standardized, mobile CARES Hardware Platform (CHP) with integrated peripheral devices and software utilities; and 2)compare the concurrent validity, test-retest reliability, and user acceptability of accompanied computerized testing vs. remote computerized testing. The CARES will be the first system of its kind and will likely find immediate commercial application across a range of healthcare delivery networks, research settings, and controlled clinical trials.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) is a unique and highly innovative technology intended to facilitate televideo-based neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation services in areas that are currently ""underserved"" due to either geographic or economic obstacles that limit access to properly trained professionals who provide such services. Among these underserved populations are individuals living in rural areas or remote regions such as Indian reservations, individuals incarcerated in correctional facilities, and a variety of ""homebound"" individuals such as non-ambulatory patients or residents of nursing homes. The need to provide otherwise unavailable mental health services to these patients is a pressing disparity that the current project hopes to address.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Computerized Assessment by Remote Examiner System (CARES) is a unique and highly innovative technology intended to facilitate televideo-based neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation services in areas that are currently ""underserved"" due to either geographic or economic obstacles that limit access to properly trained professionals who provide such services.

"Academic Career Award in Complementary and Alternative Medicine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NCCAM's 2005 Strategic Plan includes the exploration of organized health care delivery models which integrate complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) with conventional care. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey reports that approximately one in five adults use Herbs and non-vitamin Dietary Supplements (HDS). However, little is known about the number of inpatients in urban underserved hospitals who continue to use HDS while receiving treatment with allopathic medicines. Similarly, little is known about factors associated with potential HDS adverse events in hospital settings. Health information technology holds promise as an innovative and effective way to deliver HDS information to underserved patients and their physicians. This K07 application proposes essential first steps toward (1) developing a solid knowledge base about HDS use in underserved hospital patients, and (2) designing and piloting innovative methods to effectively deliver evidenced-based HDS information to underserved inpatients and their physicians, in particular through health information technology. The research objectives of this application are: (1) to contribute to the knowledge base about HDS use among minority inpatients; (2) to design culturally sensitive literacy-informed patient-centered information technology systems to teach about HDS; and (3) to develop a patient safety curriculum that will help clinicians document HDS use and communicate effectively with their patients about HDS. To achieve these objectives, this K07 application has three specific aims: (1) Investigate the association between HDS use, health literacy, medication use, and hospital utilization in a sample of 750 hospitalized patients; (2) Conduct a randomized clinical trial in sixty women who will receive a hospitalized discharge plan on cranberry delivered by a virtual patient advocate (a computerized, animated, empathic character), and a control group who receives the same information via a cranberry patient information sheet; and (3) Design, program, and evaluate a web-based HDS patient safety curriculum for clinicians, then utilize pre and post measures and chart reviews to assess its impact on clinician-patient HDS communication. Completion of this research will be supported by: (1) a core of highly skilled mentors and consultants; and (2) completion of a Graduate Certificate in Instructional Technology at the Boston University School of Education. The candidate's career goals are to become (1) an independent HDS research investigator and educator for underserved populations, and (2) a national leader in the use of health information technology for HDS patient and clinician education. To prepare herself to accomplish these career goals, as well as the research objectives outlined above, the candidate proposes (1) to undertake mentored training in patient safety, health care disparities, health literacy, and epidemiologic methods, and (2) to pursue course-working clinical trial design, statistical analysis, human subject protections, and online curriculum development.

"Causes and Consequences of Health Care Efficiency DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our original P01 grant application was motivated by the remarkable differences in health care intensity in the US. In this resubmission, we sharpen our focus in three ways. The goal is to understand and improve efficiency, the target is a more actionable level for physicians and the hospitals where they work, and the means include collaborations with key stakeholders to design successful interventions. The projects are: 1. Measuring the Efficiency of Health Care Providers. This project develops measures of efficiency - both quality and costs - and explores their implications at the level of primary care physicians, physician groups, and hospitals. We use Medicare data, patient and physician surveys, and specialty board certification scores from the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Family Practice. 2. Causes and Consequences of Variation in Pharmacotherapy Efficiency. We describe and model variation in prescription drug use using longitudinal claims data from very large insurance providers in two states, studying both consequences of variation in prescription drug use in outcomes and the impact of a large, systemic 'shock' - Medicare Part D - on existing treatment patterns and outcomes. 3. Technological Growth and the Efficiency of Health Care Diffusion. We study the contribution of ""high- tech"" health care to cost growth, the diffusion of different types of medical innovations, whether high-quality health providers affect population-level health outcomes, and how provider networks affect diffusion. 4. Geography and Disparities in Health and Health Care. We propose hospital-level disparity ""report cards,"" to study sorting of patients to disproportionately Black hospitals and to test whether the preferences of patients from a recent nation-wide survey of Medicare enrollees are reflected in their treatments. Finally, we estimate how racial differences in surgical rates affect disparities in actual health outcomes. 5. Norms Governing Physician Decision-Making For Critically III Elders. We use qualitative methods to describe the norms and values that influence the use of life-sustaining treatments among critically ill elders in emergency rooms and hospitals. We plan to test the feasibility of one or more interventions to change practice norms with the broader aim of improving efficiency. Cores: The Cores include an initiative to work with seven leading hospitals to address inefficiency in the provision of care, data support, and health efficiency measures for users of the Health and Retirement Study. Relevance: The project seeks to understand why efficiency is so poor in the U.S. health care system: 30% of health care spending is wasted, and quality of care is seriously lacking. We also explore several approaches to improving quality and reducing unwarranted variations in expenditures.",Causes and Consequences of Health Care Efficiency,8068758,P01AG019783,[''],NIA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,P01,2011,1448759,-0.0025910792234496876
"Comparing language profiles of AAE-speaking children in poverty to those with SLI  Abstract Children reared in poverty and those diagnosed with language impairments both perform poorly on standardized measures of language. Yet, the cause of poor performance for the groups is considered quite different, limited experiences and/or test bias as compared to faulty language systems. Further complicating the research is the fact that children from low-income backgrounds often speak a nonmainstream dialect. The goal of the current work is to address these issues by differentiating the language profiles of children from low- income backgrounds and those diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in narrowly defined groups. To accomplish this, we will evaluate past tense marking in four groups of African American English (AAE)-speaking children: 6-year old children from low-income backgrounds, their typically developing age- matched peers from middle income backgrounds, their typically developing language-matched peers from middle income backgrounds, and their typically developing age-matched peers diagnosed with SLI. The children's language abilities will be evaluated using spontaneous language sampling and established protocols for past tense and passive marking. Comparing group performance on these grammatical measures will further test whether the two groups demonstrate general language difficulties or more specific language difficulties (e.g., grammar or vocabulary). Such outcomes will contribute to advances in understanding individual variation across language profiles, further enhancing our diagnostic accuracy of SLI.  Public Health Relevance Statement Health disparities exist for children reared in poverty. The goal of the proposed studies is to uncover the effects of poverty on language in a group of African American children from low-income families and those diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment. By focusing our efforts on their grammatical profiles, our results should lead to improved clinical services for African American children, thus reducing health disparities.",Comparing language profiles of AAE-speaking children in poverty to those with SLI,8335190,R03DC012141,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' California ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Language ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Intelligence ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Tests ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Michigan ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Poverty ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Morphology ', ' Nature ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' regional difference ', ' Neurologic status ', ' Neurological status ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' 6 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' standardize measure ', ' child poverty ', ' ']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2012,149500,0.054447432734720316

"Disparities in Incontinence and Perineal Skin Damage in Nursing Home Elders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a study of race, ethnic, and socioeconomic (SES) disparities as they relate to the development and management of incontinence, perineal dermatitis (PD), pressure ulcers (PUs) and associated quality of life in older nursing home (NH) residents. Reports of disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage and their management are a serious ethical and clinical concern warranting further investigation. Incontinence, PUs and PD are long-standing, widespread, and costly problems to which race, ethnic and SES disparities may contribute significantly. Annual treatment costs are in the billions of dollars, and each condition is significantly associated with psychological distress, physical discomfort, and lower quality of life. Complications of PUs can be fatal. Reducing health disparities offers a profound opportunity for improving the health of disadvantaged minority populations. Because health outcomes of NH residents and disparities in those outcomes are influenced by multiple factors at the individual, group NH, and community levels before and during a NH stay, investigation to detangle their contributions requires a multi-level approach. Previous studies have focused primarily on individual level resident characteristics or controlled for only a few NH factors; none has used a multi-level, multi-factoral approach. Because of our datasets, we are uniquely able to simultaneously measure factors at the individual, NH, and community levels that are associated with disparities in the development, prevention, and management of fecal and/or urinary incontinence, PD, PUs, and associated quality of life. We will analyze three large population datasets: Minimum Data Set (MDS) records and practitioner orders for all residents of a large, for-profit NH chain, the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) files, and the US Census tract data. In addition, we will compare disparities in these health conditions and management plans in residents of the proprietary set of NHs with those in a set of national for-profit and non-profit NHs using a fourth database of MDS records (without practitioner orders) and OSCAR, and Census data in a multi-level sensitivity analysis. In so doing, we will provide context to our findings and strengthen our ability to make more informed recommendations. Our study will provide the best evidence to date about which of the many possible modifiable factors associated with disparities in these outcomes should be targeted for intervention and ascertain the level of their contribution. Therefore, our findings are critical before interventions aimed at reducing disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage can be undertaken or successful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of differences in the involuntary leakage of urine and stool, associated skin damage, and quality of life that exist because of race, ethnic background, and social and economic status of older nursing home residents. This study will also examine nursing home and community factors that may play a role in the occurrence, prevention, and management of these health problems that greatly reduce physical and psychological well-being.

"Impact of Physician non-English Language Proficiency Level on Cancer Screening     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Impact of Physician non-English Language Proficiency Level on Cancer Screening Project Summary/Abstract Communication between patients and clinicians is an essential component of cancer screening. Ineffective communication can lead to patient misunderstanding of the importance of cancer screening or disagreement with it, leading to poor adherence. Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) are at risk of disparities in cancer screening because of impaired communication with their clinicians. True language concordance occurs when clinicians are fluent in the languages their patients speak and offers an important way to reduce disparities for LEP patients. All too often though, there is only partial language concordance between patients and clinicians because the clinician does not speak the patient's language fluently but does not use an interpreter. When there is only partial language concordance, there are concerns for the quality of care provided. The goal upon completion of the proposed studies is to have evidence that will help establish standards for testing of, and allowing practice with, clinician non-English language proficiency and to reduce language-related disparities in cancer screening. The specific aims for this application are (1) To determine if a detailed self-reporting scale of clinician language proficiency correlates to the results of a validated oral proficiency test, (2) To explore clinicia characteristics that are predictors of accuracy in self-assessment of non-English language proficiency; (3) To assess whether breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening completion rates are higher for LEP patients with truly language concordant clinicians compared to those with partially language concordant clinicians. To achieve these aims, the proposed studies will first compare clinicians' self-assessment of their non-English language proficiency using the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) scale compared to the Clinician Cultural and Linguistic Assessment (CCLA), a gold standard, validated oral proficiency test. The two measures will be analyzed using quantile-quantile plots of the two distributions, the ILR and the CCLA. The analysis will also employ Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to assess the consistency of the ILR and the CCLA. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess the relationship between obtaining a passing score on the CCLA and spoken language history and provider demographic variables. Next, exploratory univariate and subsequent multivariate analyses will be performed to ascertain which factors are associated with the over- or underestimation of non-English language proficiency by clinicians. Finally, analyses will be conducted to assess the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency on breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. Hierarchical/multilevel modeling will be employed to account for patient, clinician and system level factors, with separate models conducted for each type of cancer screening. Level one will assess the probability of completing cancer screening at the patient level, including the covariates listed above. Level 2 will account for clinician factors listed above and level 3 will include clinician work sites.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Impact of Physician non-English Language Proficiency Level on Cancer Screening Project Narrative  Since many clinicians who provide language concordant care are not native speakers of their patients' language, studies are needed to help understand the degree of fluency a clinician needs in order to provide effective communication about cancer screening. Clinicians may be using varying levels of non-English language proficiency to communicate with limited English proficient patients, putting these patients at greater risk of cancer disparities. It is critical to assess the impact of the use of limited non-English language skills by clinicians on cancer screening.              The Impact of Physician non-English Language Proficiency Level on Cancer Screening ",Impact of Physician non-English Language Proficiency Level on Cancer Screening,8330389,R21CA168489,"['malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Goals ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Communication ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Nurse Practitioners ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Probability ', ' Physicians ', "" Physicians' Extenders "", "" Doctor's Assistants "", ' Physician Assistants ', ' Research ', ' Caring ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Clinical ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Testing ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Oral ', ' Services ', ' English Language ', ' Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' skills ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Characteristics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Provider ', ' cancer type ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2012,252601,0.017444557590269236

"Academic Career Award in Complementary and Alternative Medicine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NCCAM's 2005 Strategic Plan includes the exploration of organized health care delivery models which integrate complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) with conventional care. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey reports that approximately one in five adults use Herbs and non-vitamin Dietary Supplements (HDS). However, little is known about the number of inpatients in urban underserved hospitals who continue to use HDS while receiving treatment with allopathic medicines. Similarly, little is known about factors associated with potential HDS adverse events in hospital settings. Health information technology holds promise as an innovative and effective way to deliver HDS information to underserved patients and their physicians. This K07 application proposes essential first steps toward (1) developing a solid knowledge base about HDS use in underserved hospital patients, and (2) designing and piloting innovative methods to effectively deliver evidenced-based HDS information to underserved inpatients and their physicians, in particular through health information technology. The research objectives of this application are: (1) to contribute to the knowledge base about HDS use among minority inpatients; (2) to design culturally sensitive literacy-informed patient-centered information technology systems to teach about HDS; and (3) to develop a patient safety curriculum that will help clinicians document HDS use and communicate effectively with their patients about HDS. To achieve these objectives, this K07 application has three specific aims: (1) Investigate the association between HDS use, health literacy, medication use, and hospital utilization in a sample of 750 hospitalized patients; (2) Conduct a randomized clinical trial in sixty women who will receive a hospitalized discharge plan on cranberry delivered by a virtual patient advocate (a computerized, animated, empathic character), and a control group who receives the same information via a cranberry patient information sheet; and (3) Design, program, and evaluate a web-based HDS patient safety curriculum for clinicians, then utilize pre and post measures and chart reviews to assess its impact on clinician-patient HDS communication. Completion of this research will be supported by: (1) a core of highly skilled mentors and consultants; and (2) completion of a Graduate Certificate in Instructional Technology at the Boston University School of Education. The candidate's career goals are to become (1) an independent HDS research investigator and educator for underserved populations, and (2) a national leader in the use of health information technology for HDS patient and clinician education. To prepare herself to accomplish these career goals, as well as the research objectives outlined above, the candidate proposes (1) to undertake mentored training in patient safety, health care disparities, health literacy, and epidemiologic methods, and (2) to pursue course-working clinical trial design, statistical analysis, human subject protections, and online curriculum development. This award will effectively prepare the candidate to become a successful independently-funded HDS investigator, focused on the needs of underserved patients, and an expert in applying health information technology to the study and teaching of CAM.

"Estimating Hospital Outcome Quality: Applications to Pay-for-Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will pursue two major areas of research related to quality measurement and payment policy reform to improve value in healthcare. The first pertains to the evaluation and design of estimators of outcome quality and cost in order to profile the performance of healthcare providers. This research will evaluate the performance of existing estimators of outcome performance, propose new estimators, and validate the performance of these estimators to profile the quality, cost, and efficiency of hospitals and physician practices. The second area of research I will pursue is an evaluation of the Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) hospital-based pay-for-performance (P4P) program. I will test the effect of the P4P program on quality and cost for the areas incentivized in the program (maternity and newborn care, community acquired pneumonia, surgical infection prevention, pediatric asthma). I will also estimate the effect of the program on racial and ethnic disparities. To evaluate the performance of outcome measures, a simulation model will be constructed and a series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments will be designed and implemented. The basic approach is as follows: hypothetical providers are randomly assigned a ""true"" outcome score, a performance improvement trajectory, a patient risk score, a sample size, and a sample size trajectory. A random shock, inversely associated with sample size, is then created for each provider. Observed outcome scores, derived as a function of true outcome quality, patient risk, and the random shock are created for each hospital. Using only information on observed outcomes, true outcomes are then estimated using the candidate outcome estimators and the performance of these estimators is compared. The performance of these estimators will then be validated for hospitals and physicians using national Medicare data and data from Massachusetts. To evaluate the effect of the MassHealth program on quality, costs, and racial and ethnic disparities, I will draw on methods employed in my previous research. This will involve the use of panel data econometric techniques to test whether Massachusetts hospitals increased quality and decreased cost for MassHealth patients after the program was implemented. To examine the effect of the program on disparities, I will test for reductions in both within-hospital disparities in quality and between-hospital disparities in quality after the program was implemented. The skills and knowledge required to pursue my proposed research will be bolstered by an outstanding group of mentors and a robust education and career development plan. My mentors are leaders in the fields of payment and financing of healthcare, quality measurement, organizational research, health economics, and comparative effectiveness. Further, my mentors employ insights and perspectives from economics, political science, sociology, and clinical practice in their research, providing a rich and diverse intellectual environment from which I can draw upon as a mentee. In following my career development plan, I will enhance my methodological and programming skills, learn more about the responsible conduct of research, acquire knowledge of clinical practice and medical organization, and present my research findings and interact with colleagues at several national conferences. Research that successfully fulfills the aims of my K01 proposal will have important policy relevance. The proposed research will add to our knowledge about the use of outcome measures in pay-for-performance and public quality reporting while also providing further evidence about the effectiveness of pay-for- performance through the evaluation of the Massachusetts program. While ambitious, my track record of research achievement shows that I am capable of conducting research that achieves these aims. Further, the coursework and applied research conducted for the K01 will augment my research skills, enhancing my ability to achieve these aims. After collaborating with my mentors on this research, I will be have established myself as a researcher in the fields of P4P and quality measurement, positioning myself for R01 grants in these areas.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project has the potential to positively impact public health by creating more accurate estimators of healthcare provider outcome quality and cost and by contributing to the understanding of the effect of hospital-based pay-for-performance. This research can be used to design payment policy that creates stronger incentives for value and quality improvement in healthcare.

"Health IT in Ambulatory Care Settings: Effects on Quality and Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), devoted $19.2 billion to increase the use of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and other forms of information technology (IT) by healthcare providers. Underlying this substantial public subsidy is a belief that creating an electronic rather than a paper interface between patient information and healthcare providers can improve healthcare quality and also save money. Although recent studies have provided supportive evidence of a positive role for health IT in the hospital setting, less is known about the impact of IT use on quality in ambulatory care. This is despite the fact that most health services are delivered in such settings and the potential gains from health IT may be larger there. The proposed research will address that gap in two stages. First, it will develop a longitudinal national database on local area healt IT use that could potentially affect ambulatory care. The database will include health IT applications in place at ambulatory facilities as well as local hospitals and hospital systems. It will measure different types of health IT as well as the technological resources in place for health information exchange among ambulatory providers, between ambulatory providers and hospitals, and between providers and patients. The second stage of the research will estimate the impacts of various measures of local health IT on the quality of ambulatory care and on racial and ethnic disparities in health care quality. Estimation will be conducted on a merged panel database on local areas over time using multivariate regression models with local area controls and differences-in-differences models that control for unmeasured factors that are correlated with both quality and IT adoption.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: U.S. government investments in health information technology (IT) hold substantial promise for improving health care quality among U.S. residents and improving efficiency in the U.S. health care system.

"Hospital and County-Level Predictors of Immediate Breast Reconstruction Post-Mast     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immediate breast reconstruction post-mastectomy is underutilized and there are significant racial, economic and geographic disparities. This is despite the passing of the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA), which was signed into law in 1998. WHCRA mandated group health plans, health insurance companies and HMO's to cover breast reconstruction post-mastectomy. Preliminary analyses show that 23 percent of the variation in immediate breast reconstruction is due to between hospital differences and 17 percent is due to between county differences. The hospital and county-level factors that account for this variation have yet to be fully identified. The proposed research is aimed at identifying the hospital and county-level factors that influence the receipt of immediate breast reconstruction post mastectomy, above and beyond individual level factors. Individual-level data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) on ~42,000 women who underwent mastectomy to treat invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be combined with hospital-level data from the NIS, the American Hospital Association (AHA) and the American Community Survey (ACS) and county-level data from the Area Resource File (ARF). These datasets will provide information on the internal hospital environment (e.g., characteristics of the hospital inpatient population, hospital ownership status) as well as information on the county such as the density of plastic surgeons and socio-demographic characteristics of the county. In addition, the ACS data will be used to develop a geographic information system (GIS) based model of the socio-demographic characteristics of hospital neighborhoods to measure the external hospital environment. A three level generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) will be used to account for the non-independence of patients nested within hospitals and hospitals nested within counties. In this model patients will be the level one unit, hospitals will be the level two unit and counties will be the level three unit. The outcome wll be a binary variable classified by whether the patient received an immediate natural or expander/implant reconstruction or did not receive any type of immediate reconstruction. Accomplishing this research will greatly aid healthcare managers and policymakers in understanding the relative contribution of patient, hospital and county-level factors in the utilization of immediate breast reconstruction post-mastectomy. In addition, the proposed research will inform policymakers about how to reform existing policies, such as WHCRA, in order to increase utilization and eliminate disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will determine whether hospital (e.g., the proportion of patients that are non- white, the proportion of patients with public insurance and public ownership status) and county-level factors (e.g., the proportion of residents that live below the poverty level and the proportion of residents with < a high school degree) influence immediate breast reconstruction, independently of individual-level factors. The knowledge gained as a result of this research will inform policy makers about how to refine current healthcare policies such as the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, a federal policy implemented in 1998, to improve the access and utilization of breast reconstruction following mastectomy.              This project will determine whether hospital (e.g., the proportion of patients that are non- white, the proportion of patients with public insurance and public ownership status) and county-level factors (e.g., the proportion of residents that live below the poverty level and the proportion of residents with < a high school degree) influence immediate breast reconstruction, independently of individual-level factors.

"Hospital Quality Reports for Expectant Mothers: Considering Race and Language     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited English proficiency (LEP) and race/ethnicity have not been well studied in consumer reporting of hospital quality, though these factors present barriers to quality health care. Public quality reports are also underused among minority and LEP groups. The science of consumer reporting is missing core knowledge of how individuals from diverse racial/ethnic groups, including those with LEP, use hospital quality measures, what they value and understand from existing quality reports, and whether additional information or presentation features might encourage higher use. The field is also missing personalized, relevant, easy-to- understand quality reporting templates designed for distinct cultural groups and/or non-English language speakers. These issues are particularly relevant for many Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) subgroups that have distinct cultural preferences, health disparities, and high proportions of LEP. Childbirth, the most common reason women are hospitalized in the U.S., is a particularly expensive area of the health care system with known health outcome disparities and quality concerns. Pregnant women are likely to be particularly activated consumers with strong interest in hospital quality and sufficient advance notice about the upcoming hospitalization to research the topic. Improving the use of public hospital quality reports for pregnant women across diverse racial/ethnic and LEP groups could help drive overall quality improvement in childbirth and reduce maternal health outcome disparities. In order to address key knowledge gaps in the science of public reporting and to meet quality improvement and disparity reduction goals, we will: (1): Quantify inpatient maternal health quality outcomes and childbirth hospitalization patterns among diverse AA/PI and LEP populations in Hawaii to strengthen empirical evidence on this understudied topic, to determine relevant populations for Aims 2-3, and to provide group-specific results for personalized maternal inpatient quality metrics in Aim 3; (2): Describe utilization, usefulness, ease-of-use, and preferences for public reports of inpatient maternal health quality across diverse AA/PI and LEP groups by interviewing 400 women with a recent hospital delivery. Findings will be contextualized within the constraints, decision inputs, and factors relevant to the childbirth hospital decision, which are expected to vary across groups; and (3): Design and pilot test a personalized, interactive, consumer-focused website concerning the maternal hospital delivery decision, including useful and easy-to-understand inpatient quality measures. This product will draw from empirical evidence, consumer informatics theory, and web design best practices. The usefulness and usability of an English version will be pilot tested in 2 AA/PI groups (n=40) with disparities in Aim 1 and distinct preferences in Aim 2. A non-English version will be tested in an LEP group (n=20) with many speakers in the U.S., large health disparities from Aim 1, and known preferences from Aim 2.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will improve the science of consumer reporting of public hospital quality information by describing how individuals from diverse racial/ethnic groups and those with limited English proficiency use maternity- focused hospital quality information, what they value and understand from existing public reports on this topic, and whether additional information or presentation features might encourage higher use.

"Understanding Disparities in Patient-Centered Hospital Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the underlying causes of health disparities and developing effective methods to promote equitable health outcomes is a critical health policy goal. While we have substantial data showing large gaps in care between minority and non-minority patients, we have made little progress in eliminating these gaps. Previous studies indicate that optimal patient experiences with care may improve health outcomes and health status, and that minority patients report worse experiences with outpatient care than white patients. Yet, we have limited data on potential racial and ethnic disparities in patients' experiences in the hospital setting and factors that might explain these gaps. New national policy efforts, which aim to reward or penalize hospitals based on their performance on metrics of patient experience, create a need to understand whether hospitals that disproportionately care for minorities have worse performance and how we might intervene. Our work will examine both patient and hospital-level factors to better understand within and between hospital differences in patients' experiences and provide critically important data for interventions to promote equitable care. We propose to use patient-level data on patient experiences with hospital care from the HCAHPS database to examine four aims. We begin by examining whether there are racial or ethnic differences in care overall. We then examine the degree to which disparities in experience are due to ""within"" hospital differences, ""between"" hospital differences, or both. Our second aim will be to examine factors that explain or modify disparities within hospitals. Third, we will examine if the proportion of minority patients in a hospital is associated with hospital performance on patient experience metrics, and whether leadership's commitment to patient experience, financial health, and nurse staffing levels explain the relationship between proportion of minorities and patient experience. Finally, we will determine the role of these factors in improving patient experience over time. Our work will paint a national portrait of experiences of black, Hispanic, and white Americans in U.S. hospitals and provide timely data to ensure that national policies to improve care do not worsen disparities. We will quantify the degree to which disparities exist and whether they affect certain subgroups more than others. For example, if disparities in experience are most pronounced among the elderly or among hospitals with a large proportion of minority patients, these findings will provide targets for interventions. The analysis on institutional mediators should provide useful guidance about what interventions will most effectively reduce disparities in patient experience. Finally, our longitudinal analysis on how minority-serving hospitals improve over time will provide key insights about where to place future efforts to promote equitable, patient-centered care among all Americans.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ensuring optimal patient experience, a centerpiece of delivering high quality care, is now an integral part of a major national policy effort to reward hospitals based on performance. Unfortunately, we lack empirical data to help policymakers and clinical leaders improve minorities' experiences and ensure equitable delivery of care. Our study, which aims to determine whether racial and ethnic minorities have worse experiences with hospital care than non-minorities and whether key factors explain racial and ethnic differences in patient experience, will provide important and actionable information to ensure that national policy efforts to improve hospital care promote equity as well as quality.              Ensuring optimal patient experience, a centerpiece of delivering high quality care, is now an integral part of a major national policy effort to reward hospitals based on performance.

Identification of language impairment (SLI) and careful description of its trajectory during the school-age years is one area where disparities continue to exist. One population that is currently understudied is the Spanish-English bilingual school population. Significant strides have been made in the identification of markers of language impairment in young bilingual (Spanish-English) children. There are emerging strategies and instruments that guide identification of true impairment vs. language differences in this population (e.g., Gutiirrez-Clellen, Restrepo, & Simon-Cereijido, 2006; Gutiirrez-Clellen & Simon-Cereijido, 2007). There is also more detail about the kinds of language changes that bilingual children make in their two languages as they transition from the home to the school language (Hammer, Lawrence, & Miccio, 2008). A number of studies examine reading outcomes in bilingual children as well. However, there is a lack of systematic longitudinal studies examining the consequences of SLI in bilingual children. Spanish speakers are the largest language minority in the US and they make up 79 percent of the school age limited English speaking population. During the school age years children need to move quickly from basic conversational skills in English to development of academic language skills. Yet, during the early second language acquisition, performance in each language is highly variable, demonstrated by inconsistent levels of fluency across each language (Bialystok, 2001). ELL children with SLI are at higher risk for low educational and linguistic outcomes. The higher risk comes from at least two major sources: (1) lack of English proficiency that limits academic access; and (2) their language impairment that puts them at-risk for other academic difficulties. We propose to examine developmental outcomes in three domains (phonology/phonotactics, vocabulary/semantics, morphosyntax) in bilingual children at three ability levels (SLI, typical developing-at risk, typically developing). This project has two main phases. In phase 1 we focus on risk for language impairment as a function of Spanish/English exposure and use patterns across three grades (preschool, first grade, and third). In phase 2 a multiple longitudinal design will be employed that will include 4 overlapping cohorts to span the preschool through 5th grade age range. We incorporate processing tasks tied to each domain designed to tap into children's ability to alter processing with experience (i.e., short term learning). Here, we focus on learning trajectories for bilingual children with and without SLI. The results will provide a unique perspective on the linking of development across domains (e.g., phonological skills supporting acquisition of morphosyntactic forms), within and across a bilingual child's languages, as well as how development is modulated by language exposure, impairment, and variations in production processes.

"Effect of Emergency Care Availability on Racial Disparities in Access & Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial differences in the burden of cardiovascular disease contribute significantly to health disparities observed in the United States. Timely access to emergency care is critical for diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF), yet access to emergency departments (EDs) varies substantially across communities. The deterioration of ED access, due to either ED closure or crowding (henceforth ""ED access block""), is associated with increased mortality rates. It has been posited that ED closures may improve acute care by removing poor-performers in a competitive market such that there is a tradeoff between distance traveled and quality of care. The risk of this assumption however, is that if ED closures occur mainly in minority communities, there could be differential effects on minority communities. We seek to fill this gap in the literature. Our long-term goal is to identify system-level mechanisms in emergency care delivery that contribute to disparities across various segments of the population. Our objectives are (1) to identify whether ED access block is a possible contributor to the widening of process and health outcome disparities between black and white patients with CHF and AMI; and (2) whether improved access (as a result of ED openings) may reduce disparities. We will link Medicare claims, hospital surveys, location data, and daily ambulance diversion logs from 2001 to 2010 to address the following Specific Aims (sample size is ~6 million admissions): Aim 1: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority patients relative to others within a community and whether ED openings can reduce those disparities. We hypothesize that ED access block results in a higher percentage of black patients being admitted to facilities with lower level technology, receiving inferior treatment, and experiencing worse patient outcomes as compared to white patients. Aim 2: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority-serving hospitals and whether ED openings can reduce disparities. We hypothesize that minority-serving hospitals are disproportionately burdened with a higher patient load and experience deteriorating quality relative to other facilities with the same level of ED access block. Aim 3: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority-heavy communities and whether ED openings can reduce disparities. We hypothesize that minority-heavy communities experience reduced technology access and quality relative to others when exposed to ED access block. Achieving these aims will offer an unusually complete picture of the potential mechanisms through which disparities can occur at patient-, facility-, and community-levels. Such mechanisms will inform policy makers whether certain measures are needed to improve efficiency of care and minimize disparities. Our framework can be applied broadly to investigate other types of disparities where ED access is critical.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the research is to determine whether emergency department closures or crowding widens racial disparities in access and outcomes at patient-, facility-, and community-levels; and whether improved access as a result of ED opening can reduce such disparities. Health policies aiming to improve efficiency of care delivery can have unintended consequences of widening health disparities. Our results will offer an unusually complete picture of the potential mechanisms through which disparities can occur at different levels of care delivery, as well as inform policies with specific measures that may be applied to minimize disparities.              The objective of the research is to determine whether emergency department closures or crowding widens racial disparities in access and outcomes at patient-, facility-, and community-levels; and whether improved access as a result of ED opening can reduce such disparities.

"Racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals for coronary heart disease The primary goal of this K08 application is to support Dr loana Popescu to become an independent investigator in the area of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. The application will involve the assimilation of new methodological skills and the analysis of a number of existing health care databases. In support of the application, Dr. Popescu has assembled a team of experienced mentors-Drs. Gary Rosenthal (Department of Internal Medicine), Gerald Rushton (Geography), and Kevin Leicht (Sociology), who bring expertise in complementary methodological areas and who have assisted Dr. Popescu in designing integrated plans for career development and research. The Career Plan includes advanced training in: 1) hierarchical biostatistical modeling and clinical research ethics; 2) the application of spatial analysis and geographic information systems methods in health care; and 3) methods for measuring residential segregation and understanding its sociological roots. These goals will be accomplished through targeted coursework, tutorials, directed readings, and direct research experiences guided by her mentors. The Research Plan will examine the interplay between geography, segregation and health care system factors, in order to build a comprehensive understanding of why black patients are less likely to receive care for acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass surgery in high quality hospitals. The Research Plan includes three incremental aims that capitalize on a number of national data sources, including: Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims files; US Census data; American Hospital Association surveys; the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile; and DartmouthAtlas health care market data. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between race, proximity to the admitting and to high quality hospitals, and the likelihood of admission to high quality hospitals. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of residential segregation on disparities in admissions to high quality hospitals. Aim 3 will examine the effects of patterns of prior outpatient care on disparities in admission to high quality hospitals and will build Dr. Popescu's fluency in analyzing more complex outpatient physician claims files. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Despite sustained national attention, significant gaps remain in research on causes of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. The proposed projects will bring an important contribution to elucidating the geographic and social context factors contributing to these persistent disparities.

"An Analysis of the Impact of Linguistic and Paralinguistic Variables in Mediated    DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant):  Of the financial, structural, and personal barriers that limit access to healthcare, language is one of the most persistent. Despite this, empirical research delving into the complexities of mediated (interpreted) human interaction in healthcare settings is scarce, and many of the studies that do exist pose serious limitations when considered in the light of current linguistic theoretical frameworks. The influx of language-minority patients into the U.S. health system has led to a flurry of interest in the healthcare interpreter by medical researchers, with a number of studies in recent years being conducted to compare the performance of ad hoc interpreters to ""professional"" interpreters; to analyze misunderstanding and breakdown in communication caused by interpreters; and to develop approaches to testing the language proficiency and interpreting skills of healthcare interpreters. These studies have been carried out in isolation, with little input from the science of linguistics, in which studies in interaction have been conducted for decades. They fail to tease apart important variables related to the profile of the interpreter and provider, and to the interactional goals of particular communicative events in healthcare. The purpose of this research is to improve healthcare access provided to language minority patients (speakers of Spanish and ASL, in particular) by revealing some of the underlying obstacles (linguistic contributors) to healthcare patient-provider interaction. These contributors will be identified through qualitative and quantitative data collection approaches, including video recorded provider-patient encounters at a large hospital in south Texas. Demographics will also be collected on providers, patients, and interpreters and relationships between their profiles and linguistic contributors to miscommunication will be explored. This research is grounded in concepts derived from interactional sociolinguistics and conversation analysis.           Project Narrative Although language is discussed frequently in the literature as one of the major contributors to health disparities, empirical research delving into the complexities of mediated (interpreted) human interaction in healthcare settings is scarce. This study will explore and compare interpreted and non-interpreted interaction in healthcare settings, with a specific focus on breakdowns in communication. Qualitative and quantitative analyses will be conducted to identify linguistic contributors to miscommunication and their correlation with interpreter, provider, and patient profiles.

"Understanding Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many studies have documented important racial disparities in surgical outcomes but their etiologies are not clear. While we generally find better surgical outcomes (lower mortality) at teaching hospitals, and a higher rate of minority patients at these hospitals, the survival benefit at teaching hospitals does not seem to equally apply to white and black patients. This application will explore why we observe disparities in three common surgical specialties that are performed throughout most hospitals where surgery is practiced: general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery. The application will focus on a classic measure of surgical practice - the procedure time. While always available on chart review, the ability to study surgical procedure time on a vast scale with Medicare claims is new. Anesthesiologists began billing Medicare by the minute in 1994. Using these bills to estimate procedure length in a population of Pennsylvania patients, we have recently published that there was a significant and clinically important disparity in the length of operations based on race and income, after detailed adjustment for patient characteristics and procedure type. This disparity was greatest at hospitals with residency programs, where the procedure time of black patients in the lowest third of the income distribution was on average 31 minutes longer than that of white patients at the same level of income (P<0.0001). In non-resident hospitals the mean gap was 8 minutes (P<0.0001). In further work we have shown that the disparity in procedure length gets larger with longer procedure times (at the 95 percentile using quantile regression, the difference between blacks and whites is about 3 of an hour). Furthermore, in our examination of all teaching and non-teaching hospitals in the state of Pennsylvania, the 15 hospitals with the largest number of black patients undergoing orthopedic and general surgery, excess adjusted procedure time (black-white by hospital) was statistically significant in 5 of 15 hospitals, with their mean excess times ranging from 9 to 16 minutes. The strength of using operative time as a measure of disparity is that it reflects precisely what the surgical and anesthesia team have done, and is not confounded by patient compliance or preferences, as some other measures of process and outcome may be. This application aims: (1) To study and describe racial and income/SES disparity in procedure time across surgeons and hospitals; (2) To identify the determinants of disparity in procedure time across surgeons and hospitals. We will study those geographic, hospital, and surgeon characteristics associated with the greatest disparities in procedure time; and (3) To make practical recommendations to departments of surgery regarding procedure length and to create models to allow surgery departments to practically monitor such disparities in order to develop mechanisms to eliminate problems if found. Project Narrative Minority Medicare patients undergoing surgery often have worse outcomes and longer procedure times than whites with comparable comorbidities and procedures.

"RISE Program Option I: University of Puerto Rico at Cayey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The RISE program continues to transform the academic environment at UPR-Cayey by focusing on the preparation of students to become scientists. As part of this long term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in four areas, 1- their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, 2- their limited research skills and experience, 3- limited quantitative and qualitative skills, and 4- limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, five developmental activities are prescribed- visiting scientists, research skills, discovery chemistry, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting alumni scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. RISE students will take Discovery Chemistry to quantitative and qualitative skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 60 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the USA. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: 1) research and language skills with faculty mentors; 2) motivational visiting alumni scientists; 3) inquiry methodology by chemistry faculty and 4) research lab experience with either on- island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the USA. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPRC alumni who will be biomedical research scientists. During the last 5 years (2005-09), 32 RISE alumni completed Ph.D.s from major research universities; a 100% increase over the previous five-year period. By doubling the number of Ph.D. alumni, RISE will impact the community. These UPRC scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases.

"Nurse Practice Environment Influences in Reducing Disparities In Hospital Outcome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to prepare Margo Brooks Carthon, PhD, RN, for an independent health services research career, with a special focus on disparities research. The career development plan entails three approaches to achieve the immediate and long-term career goals of the candidate, including 1) completion of training dedicated to acquiring skills in advanced health outcomes research methods and statistics; 2) enlistment of an expert mentorship team including Dr. Linda Aiken, PhD, FAAN, RN, Dr. Herbert Smith and Dr. David Barton Smith and 3) the conduct of a study to evaluate the influence of nurse practice environments on hospital outcomes of minority patients, that will lead to future R-series grant applications. I have an offer for a faculty position from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing upon the completion of my post-doctoral research fellowship. The research project seeks to understand how characteristics of the nurse work force and the nurse practice environment influence outcomes among hospitalized minority patients. This study will employ a cross sectional, observational design to determine the effects of nurse work force and the practice environment on selected patient outcomes in order to assess what types of investments in nursing resources might be most beneficial to minority patient outcomes. The specific aims of the research project are to: 1) examine the difference in post operative mortality and failure to rescue rates among minority and non-minority patients, and determine how much of the differences in minority patient outcomes are explained by underlying patient characteristics such as comorbidites or characteristics of the hospitals where minorities seek care; and 2) determine to what extent differences in minority patient post surgical outcomes are associated with nurse staffing, the proportion of nurses with BSN education, and the quality of the nurse practice environment. It is anticipated that the results of the study will inform managerial and policy initiatives on how to improve health outcomes, particularly in hospitals serving a large proportion of minorities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal directly addresses the public health concern regarding disparities in health outcomes among hospitalized racial and ethnic minorities. Its results will represent one of the first initiatives to evaluate the influence of nursing care and the practice environment on minority patient outcomes and will provide a preliminary assessment of what kinds of investments in nursing are most beneficial.

"The quality of care in minority serving hospitals explains cancer disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Does variation in the quality of care in minority serving hospitals explain cancer disparities? Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the US and the second most common cause of cancer death. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes are well documented in the literature, but there is little about the mechanisms that support and maintain disparities. More recent explanations suggest that the quality of care in hospitals where minorities cluster for treatment may play a role. Aims and Hypotheses: The overall objective of the current study is to assess clinical performance in the institutions where minorities cluster for colorectal cancer (CRC) care and elucidate how the quality of care in these settings correlate with outcome disparities. The central hypothesis is that minorities cluster for CRC care in hospitals with low compliance with evidence based care and higher complication rates; and that use of these hospitals, as well as the quality of care delivered therein, will explin some of the observed disparities in CRC. Methods: Retrospective data analysis of a large, all-state, all-age, all-payer administrative data set comprised a linkage between the California Cancer Registry, the California Patient Discharge and Hospital Annual Financial Data. Minority-serving hospitals (MSH) will be defined by density of black and Hispanic patients. These hospitals will be further characterized as to Medicaid utilization rates, annual surgical volume, National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer center designation; and performance on evidence based measures of care (12 lymph node examination, chemotherapy for stage III disease and preoperative staging for rectal cancer) and Patient safety indicator (PSI) rates (postoperative sepsis and respiratory failure). The AHRQ software will be used to calculate PSI rates. Analysis: A combination of Pearson chi-squared analysis will be used to define and characterize MSH and compare performance of MSH against other hospitals on quality measures and PSI's. Cox proportional hazard and multi- level (hierarchical) modeling will be used to assess the correlation of MSH use and performance on 5-year mortality. Multi-level modeling will be used to distinguish the effects of the hospital from the effects of patient characteristics on mortality         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Does variation in the quality of care in minority serving hospitals explain cancer disparities? The current proposal investigating variation in the quality o care in minority serving hospitals has public health relevance because these hospitals not only serve minorities, but also serve the poor and uninsured. As the rate of un- and underinsurance increases across the country, and as the implementation of health care reform begins, the results of our study may inform policy to improve cancer care and reduce cancer disparities.              Does variation in the quality of care in minority serving hospitals explain cancer disparities?

"Tense and Agreement in SAAE and SWE by Dialect Density and SLI Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the work is to examine the tense and agreement systems of children with and without specific language impairment (SLI) in Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). Although strides have been made in the study of SLI in SAAE and SWE, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of these dialects, and of the manifestations of SLI within them. These gaps in the literature create barriers to the representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this impedes the development of valid and efficient clinical services for children who speak these dialects. The focus of the work is on tense and agreement because recent findings from our lab and others indicate that nonstandard English-speaking children with SLI present difficulties with this aspect of language when compared to same dialect-speaking controls. These findings are consistent with two linguistic theories of SLI, the Extended Optional Infinitive account (EOI; Rice & Wexler, 1996; Rice, Wexler & Cleave, 1995) and the Feature-based Limited Functional Category account (F-LFC; Hegarty, 2005). Within the proposed work, we will further evaluate and specify the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE and complete four tests of the EOI and F-LFC models. The four tests involve: 1) the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE; 2) the nature of the tense and agreement systems of typically developing children who vary in their nonstandard dialect use; 3) the relation between measures of children's tense and agreement systems and their general language ability, cognition, and environment; and 4) the relation between children's overt marking of tense and agreement and their overt marking of other functional categories (negation, complementizers) within an utterance. For the first three tests, the models make similar predictions but for the fourth, the models make different predictions. To achieve these goals, we will complete one large-scale study of 240 children in eight participant groups. These groups will allow us to compare same-dialect speaking children with and without SLI to each other (Test 1); evaluate differences between groups of typically developing children who produce low, medium, and high densities of SAAE and SWE (Test 2); complete regression analyses (Test 3); and complete a functional category analysis of utterances that contain tense and agreement, negation, and complementizers (Test 4). The data will come from language samples, standardized testing, and experimental probes as has been done in studies of standard English. However, to adequately evaluate the children's language systems and test the predictions of the EOI and F-LFC models within SAAE and SWE, we will create dialect-appropriate stimuli and dialect-appropriate coding systems. Findings from the work will lead to improved clinical services for children and a reduction of the health disparities that exist in the rural Deep South and elsewhere. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South. The proposed studies seek to learn more about children within these communities by focusing on the grammatical profile of SLI within Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). The findings should lead to a better understanding of the SLI grammar profile within these dialects while also providing four tests of two linguistic models of SLI. These findings should result in greater representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this should lead to improved clinical services and a reduction of health disparities for children who live in the rural Deep South and elsewhere.

"Identifying Ways to Reduce Readmissions Among Minority-Serving U.S. Hospitals     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia are three of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the Medicare program, and each is associated with high 30-day readmission rates. Although readmissions are common across all patient groups, black patients are more likely than white patients to be readmitted for reasons that are not well understood. The site of care likely plays an important role: care for minorities is concentrated among a small number of minority-serving hospitals (MSHs), which provide a lower quality of care and have worse outcomes, including higher readmission rates. However, even among MSHs, there are large variations: in preliminary analyses, we found three-fold variations in readmission rates (e.g. for AMI, 12.2% in the best versus 35.7% in the worst quartile) with some MSHs achieving results comparable to the best hospitals nationally. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made reducing readmissions a priority by requiring that Medicare lower payments to hospitals with high readmission rates and in preliminary analyses for this proposal, we found that MSHs have nearly three times greater odds of being in the worst quartile of performance nationally. If these hospitals fail to improve, the new policy is likely to worsen existing disparities in care. However, we know little about why some MSHs have low readmission rates while others lag behind. Helping MSHs reduce readmissions is critically important, but we lack the empirical data to make evidence-based recommendations. We propose to examine key patient-, hospital-, and market-level factors that explain the large variations in readmission among MSHs, and determine if the presence of these factors explains gaps in performance between MSHs and non-MSHs. We will use case studies to characterize readmission prevention practices at MSHs with the highest and lowest risk-adjusted readmission rates. We will then use a national survey of hospital Chief Medical Officers to create the first national picture of current knowledge, priorities, and programs around readmissions. Finally, we will use administrative databases to examine the degree to which these factors explain variations in readmissions among MSHs, whether the important factors we identify also explain variation at non-MSHs, and whether they explain disparities between non-MSHs and MSHs. Understanding the substantial variations in readmission rates among MSHs will allow us to identify key factors that are actionable and relevant to MSHs. These data will help policymakers craft effective and novel interventions help MSHs improve care for all their patients, thus reducing disparities in readmissions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia are three of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the Medicare program, and each is associated with high 30-day readmission rates. Black patients have higher readmission rates than white patients for these conditions, and much of this difference is driven by site of care: minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) have higher rates of readmissions than non-MSHs. Even within MSHs, there are nearly three-fold differences in readmission rates, suggesting there are ample opportunities to improve. Our study will use a mixed-methods approach, including case studies, a national survey of hospital Chief Medical Officers, and multilevel modeling with Medicare data, to understand patient-, hospital-, and market-level factors that impact rates of readmissions at MSHs, with the goal of identifying actionable factors that could help policymakers craft effective policies to improve care among these providers and reduce racial disparities in this important health outcome.              Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia are three of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the Medicare program, and each is associated with high 30-day readmission rates.

"Socio-behavioral Training and Research (STaR) Program for Nursing College Student     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in disease prevention, health behavior change, and healthcare delivery require collaboration and integration between a range of disciplines and professions, including nurses, physicians and behavioral scientists. The proposed project is a collaborative effort between the Wayne State University (WSU) Pediatric Prevention Research Center located in the School of Medicine (PPRC-SOM) and the WSU College of Nursing (CON). The multidisciplinary PPRC faculty and staff are engaged in a range of domestic and international socio-behavioral health intervention research projects focused on the development and adaptation of evidence-based programming to decrease health risks for children, adolescents, and their families. PPRC faculty are also actively involved in training and mentoring young scientists in the U.S. and internationally. The CON includes faculty members representing clinical experts and active nurse scientists. In the winter 2011 term, the CON had an enrollment of 215 undergraduate and 444 graduate-level students of which 28% are from non-white ethnic groups and 20.9% are male. More than 50% of CON students receive some form of financial aid. The CON is home to the Center for Health Research (CHR) through which faculty members are engaged in nursing research conducted in the context of an urban environment contributing to the science to reduce disparities and improve health outcomes in diverse communities. The proposed Socio- behavioral Training and Research (STaR) program will target junior and senior nursing students from CON. The STaR program combines established mentoring approaches and modern communication technologies to support this diverse group of young men and women toward careers in research and nursing science. The STaR program will be transdisciplinary and organized within Newman's Catalytic Capacity Building Model, which offers a conceptual framework for effective mentoring. The specific aims of the program are:  1) Expand on the existing infrastructure at the PPRC and CON to train undergraduate nursing students in transdisciplinary socio-behavioral health research;  2) Enhance and expand the research skills of undergraduate nursing students with the goal of improving their ability to transition to either graduate studies and/or research work environments;  3) Provide research training to students from diverse backgrounds underrepresented in the health- related sciences;  4) Establish an on-going training program that will provide a sustained linkage for transdisciplinary research and education between faculty mentors, current trainees, and STaR alumni;  5) Utilize continuous process and outcome evaluations (quantitative and qualitative) to provide feedback between program administrators, and mentors, trainees, and alumni throughout the five-year implementation of the STaR program.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project is designed to address nursing faculty shortages at both the baccalaureate and graduate levels and the need for more nursing scientists.

We have documented in our current work significant increases in chronic health conditions among people seeking hospital care for acute medical illnesses such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute congestive heart failure, and for general surgery, reflecting changes in population health. We will determine whether nursing factors are particularly important for preventing adverse outcomes during hospitalization for these at-risk patients. Our greatest interest is in three conditions that are increasing significantly among hospitalized patients and have important implications for nursing care: obesity, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary disease. We look not only at the outcomes for individual patients with these underlying chronic conditions. We also examine whether the outcomes for patients without chronic conditions are poorer in hospitals with higher concentrations of patients with these particular chronic conditions. All else being equal, we expect that non-chronic patients in hospitals with high concentrations of chronic patients may not benefit as much from better nurse staffing and care environments as similar patients in hospitals with lower concentrations of chronic patients because nurses in the former hospitals devote relatively more attention to those at risk of poor outcomes but are not likely to be better staffed. Similarly, we turn our attention to racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes to test whether poorer outcomes for minorities are explained by a combination of multiple underlying chronic health conditions and the concentration of minorities in hospitals with poor nurse staffing and education and less satisfactory care environments. Surprisingly the large literature on health disparities rarely considers how nursing might be a factor that explains poor outcomes, which is a necessary step to understanding whether improving nurse staffing and care environments is likely to contribute to reducing disparities in hospital outcomes. The findings have implications for nurse staffing standards and hospital payment, particularly for minority-serving hospitals.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in population health, including sharp increases in chronic conditions, contribute to the complexity of hospital care and increase the risk for poor outcomes. Disparities in hospital outcomes by race and ethnicity persist. This study examines whether improving nursing resources in hospitals would be a potentially effective strategy to improve outcomes in these overlapping populations.

"Hospital Care Environment, Neighborhood, and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are well-documented racial and ethnic disparities in the costly and often preventable outcomes of mortality, readmission, and prolonged hospitalization due to the common conditions of heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction. The causes and solutions for these disparities, however, are not clear. Evidence has begun to point toward differences in the hospitals where most minorities and non- minorities receive care as a source of disparities. Surprisingly, two important factors and their interrelationship, which may explain how hospital differences are associated with disparities and point to opportunities for targeted intervention, have received insufficient attention: the quality of nursing in the hospital in which patients are cared for and the characteristics of the neighborhoods of patients served by different hospitals. Nurses  provide vital bedside care, 24/7 surveillance, education, and care coordination that may narrow disparity gaps,  but little is known about the degree to which minority patients are treated in hospitals with lower quality nursing  and the effect of these differences on disparities. Nursing as a systems factor is an appealing feature to study because unlike many hospital characteristics, it can be improved through intervention by administrators or policymakers. Evidence suggests that most minority older adults are cared for in a relatively small proportion of hospitals. The quality of the nursing care environment (including nurse staffing level, level of nurse education, and a care environment supportive of professional nursing practice) can vary significantly from hospital to hospital and these factors affect patient outcomes. If differences in nursing care environment are shown to be associated with disparities, strategies targeting nursing in hospitals that predominantly serve minority- populations could be implemented.  We must also consider that outcomes variation by hospital may reflect differences in the populations that different hospitals treat. Although researchers often account for differences in individual characteristics, the effect of the hospital environment is rarely examined in relation to the effect of the neighborhood where patients live. Research shows that the socio-ecological qualities of an older adult's neighborhood (e.g., socioeconomic position, segregation, and primary care services availability) impact health outcomes. In addition to an independent effect, we expect that neighborhood factors affect older adults' access to high-quality hospital services including quality nursing care. We will use multilevel and cross-classified models as well as geographic information systems (GIS) methods to examine unique survey data from hospital nurses along with Medicare claims data that is geocoded and linked with neighborhood data.  Our approach will allow us to untangle the interrelated effects of the hospital care environment and patient neighborhood on racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes among older adults, point to interventions that may reverse disparities, and identify communities and hospitals that can most benefit from interventions.         Racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes for older adults are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By examining the inter-related effects of the  hospital care environment and the neighborhoods from which hospitals draw patients, our study will help  explain previously unexplored causes of racial and ethnic disparities, inform efforts to improve the hospital care  environment, and target limited resources to the hospitals and communities that could most benefit from them.

"Improving Nursing Home Compare to Meet the Needs of Minority Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elders and potential users of nursing home public report cards do not have uniform care needs or information preferences. Yet little is known about how information use, needs, and preferences vary across population groups. Further, no nursing home report cards present performance measures stratified by race/ethnicity. The goals of this study are to identify ways in which Nursing Home Compare (NHC) can be improved to better meet the needs and preferences of minority populations and to test NHC measure stratification by race/ethnicity. To this end, this study seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1 Collect feedback from minority elders, caregivers, and other stakeholders on their opinions of NHC and about how the report cards might be changed to better suit their needs and priorities; 2. Use existing data to create NHC performance measures stratified by population group and a set of related disparities measures and determine the statistical relevance and feasibility of such measures; 3. Determine whether different population members find measure stratification and disparities measures useful in seeking nursing home care. This study will focus on the nursing home public reporting needs and preferences of African American/black elders and Hispanic/Latino elders. Initial consumer feedback on needs and preferences will be collected through focus groups and interviews with elders and family members of these groups, in addition to non-Hispanic white elders and family members and discharge planners. Data from the Minimum Data Set regarding resident characteristics and outcomes will be used to create several forms of NHC performance indicators, stratified by population group, and a set of related disparities measures. Statistical testing and trends analysis will be conducted to ascertain the relevance and feasibility of stratifying measures. Finally, these measures will be presented to the different population group members to collect data on their opinions of the usefulness and value of such measures.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Makers of private and public report cards can use the findings from this study to understand how information needs and preferences vary by race/ethnicity and to inform efforts to increase report card use among these groups. Policymakers and nursing home administrators can use the findings to understand the extent to which care varies by population group within facilities. Findings will also provide insight into the statistical feasibiity of using stratified and disparities measures in nursing home public reporting, as well as consumers' perceived value such information has in making nursing home decisions.              Makers of private and public report cards can use the findings from this study to understand how information needs and preferences vary by race/ethnicity and to inform efforts to increase report card use among these groups.

"UCLA/CDU Partnership for Enhancing Diversity of Nurses with Research Careers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities for individuals from under-represented minority groups (URMGs) continue to plague the US population. The roots of this problem are many and complex, but of great relevance is the dearth of individuals from URMGs in the health professions workforce, with serious disparities in the ethnic/racial composition of the workforce being particularly pronounced in nursing. The 2008 NSSRN survey showed 32.1% of Black/African American nurses and 39.4% of Latino nurses had baccalaureate degrees; for all racial/ethnic groups combined, only 11.4% had graduate degrees including PhDs. This state exists at a time when the US population is becoming older and more ethnically diverse. Given this dire state of affairs, we are proposing to enhance an existing relationship between the Schools of Nursing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU), an Historically Black Graduate Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution, for the purpose developing and implementing an integrated plan of individual and institutional activities to prepare masters students from URMGs to make a seamless transition to doctoral education. The long term goal of this project is to increase the ethnic/racial diversity of those prepared to pursue research careers in nursing focusing on research about aging adults (45+ years) by (1) increasing involvement of master's students and faculty at CDU SON in the scientific enterprise through structured development activities; (2) enriching the research course offerings and scientific environment at CDU SON to prepare master's students to seamlessly transition to doctoral education; and (3) facilitating student advancement to the UCLA SON via systems that facilitate student enrollment and scientific exchange between faculty at UCLA and CDU.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities persist despite efforts to curb them.

"Biophysical Measure To Predict Pressure Ulcers In Nursing Home Residents  Project Abstract This study will test the validity of a non-visual assessment strategy for stage I pressure ulcers (PUs) among nursing home (NH) residents with light or dark skin tones using a multi-site, longitudinal cohort design. PUs are common, often preventable, and costly; detection of early-stage PUs is important because intervention may prevent decline to more severe PUs. The standard method of detection, visual skin assessment for non- blanchable erythema, is somewhat reliable for individuals with light skin tones but detects changes after skin damage has already occurred. In addition, visual skin assessment fails to detect skin color changes in persons with darkly pigmented skin. Documented health disparities between African Americans and Caucasians for incidence of stage I PUs and prevention intervention may be related to deficiencies in detection. In our prior studies, we showed that a hand-held device that assesses sub-epidermal moisture (SEM), a measure of edema from inflammatory changes in the tissues, identified stage I PUs. Further, SEM was higher (e.g., increased edema and inflammation) when there was no visible skin damage at the time but a stage I PU was visible on the skin one week later; SEM values predicted 26% of the subsequent stage I PUs. Findings were similar in a small sub-sample of NH residents with dark skin tones. We propose to test the validity of this innovative approach to detecting PUs, particularly focusing on residents with dark skin tones; to test threshold SEM values for detecting stage I PUs and detecting progression of stage I PUs to stage II+ PUs. We will recruit 389 NH residents, 62 of whom will have dark skin tones, who are at risk for PU based on the Minimum Data Set Assessment from 24 NHs. Visual skin assessments and blinded SEM measures will be completed by research staff at least weekly for consented residents for 4 months. Skin tone of NH residents will be assessed using color tiles rather than by proxy measures of ethnicity as in previous research. In addition, participant demographics, MDS assessment data on functional level, and comorbid medical conditions will be obtained from medical record review. Risk assessments using the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sores will be collected at baseline. Generalized ordered logistic modeling, appropriately modeling the repeated observations and time-dependent measures, will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of SEM measures to identify future skin damage. Measurement of SEM represents a potentially important tool for decreasing the disparity of prevention interventions between persons with different skin tones.  Relevance Statement to Public Health This project is the next step in the evaluation of a new assessment technique for bedsores, a common problem for nursing home residents. If this measurement can identify skin damage at an earlier stage to allow prompt intervention, evidence will be powerful for evaluating its use through a clinical trial. In addition, replacing methods of assessing skin damage that rely on skin color changes has the potential of reducing the severity of skin damage in persons with darkly pigmented skin, leading to reduction in observed health disparities and equalizing the chance of detecting damage at a point when prevention practices can be most effective.",Biophysical Measure To Predict Pressure Ulcers In Nursing Home Residents,8267549,R01NR010736,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Attention ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Government ', ' Hand ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Logistic Models ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Pigments ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk ', ' Sacral Bone ', ' sacrum ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Ulceration ', ' Ulcer ', ' Erythema ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Caucasians ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Healed ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Staging ', ' Redness ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' skin color ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Skin ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Prevention Protocols ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' Early treatment ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2012,307458,0.022727245525079705
"Bridges to the Bacclaureate Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) partnership between the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing (NHWSN) at Emory University and the Nursing Program at Georgia Perimeter College (GPC). The program focuses on identifying students from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups - groups who are underrepresented in nursing and nursing science as well - and supporting them through the associate degree to the baccalaureate in nursing (BSN) and on to careers in nursing science in the PhD program in Nursing at Emory or at similar research-intensive institutions. BttB aims to increase the number of underrepresented students who complete the AS degree in Nursing at GPC and enter the BSN program at NHWSN; who develop skills and knowledge in nursing science; and who are socialized into the culture and profession of nursing science and move forward to doctoral studies. BttB responds to national needs to address the nursing shortage by developing a next generation of nursing scientists to be faculty in schools of nursing who both teach and create the evidence for improved practice. It also addresses the IOM call for nursing leadership to work with other professions to develop innovative solutions to the nation's health care crisis and to the persistent problem of health disparities. The BttB program will consist of five elements; (1) recruitment and enrollment; (2) research exposure; (3) research immersion; (4) academic programming; and (5) mentoring, advising, and counseling. Faculty from both institutions will participate in selecting GPC students into the BttB program in their first semester in the GPC nursing program. Research roundtables and summer and school-year research immersion experiences will strengthen the environment of research at GPC and will enable students to learn about nursing science both conceptually and experientially. The roundtable and immersion experiences will continue when students transfer to NHWSN and enter an RN-BSN program that is specifically tailored to accommodate their prior training and to further immerse them in nursing science. At NHWSN, BttB students will be in an environment characterized by the active conduct of funded research by a large number of tenured and tenure track faculty.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) program seeks to move underrepresented students from an associate degree in nursing (AS) program through a bachelor degree in nursing (BSN) program and to a point of readiness for doctoral training in nursing science.

"Hospital Quality Reports for Expectant Mothers: Considering Race and Language     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited English proficiency (LEP) and race/ethnicity have not been well studied in consumer reporting of hospital quality, though these factors present barriers to quality health care. Public quality reports are also underused among minority and LEP groups. The science of consumer reporting is missing core knowledge of how individuals from diverse racial/ethnic groups, including those with LEP, use hospital quality measures, what they value and understand from existing quality reports, and whether additional information or presentation features might encourage higher use. The field is also missing personalized, relevant, easy-to- understand quality reporting templates designed for distinct cultural groups and/or non-English language speakers. These issues are particularly relevant for many Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) subgroups that have distinct cultural preferences, health disparities, and high proportions of LEP. Childbirth, the most common reason women are hospitalized in the U.S., is a particularly expensive area of the health care system with known health outcome disparities and quality concerns. Pregnant women are likely to be particularly activated consumers with strong interest in hospital quality and sufficient advance notice about the upcoming hospitalization to research the topic. Improving the use of public hospital quality reports for pregnant women across diverse racial/ethnic and LEP groups could help drive overall quality improvement in childbirth and reduce maternal health outcome disparities. In order to address key knowledge gaps in the science of public reporting and to meet quality improvement and disparity reduction goals, we will: (1): Quantify inpatient maternal health quality outcomes and childbirth hospitalization patterns among diverse AA/PI and LEP populations in Hawaii to strengthen empirical evidence on this understudied topic, to determine relevant populations for Aims 2-3, and to provide group-specific results for personalized maternal inpatient quality metrics in Aim 3; (2): Describe utilization, usefulness, ease-of-use, and preferences for public reports of inpatient maternal health quality across diverse AA/PI and LEP groups by interviewing 400 women with a recent hospital delivery. Findings will be contextualized within the constraints, decision inputs, and factors relevant to the childbirth hospital decision, which are expected to vary across groups; and (3): Design and pilot test a personalized, interactive, consumer-focused website concerning the maternal hospital delivery decision, including useful and easy-to-understand inpatient quality measures. This product will draw from empirical evidence, consumer informatics theory, and web design best practices. The usefulness and usability of an English version will be pilot tested in 2 AA/PI groups (n=40) with disparities in Aim 1 and distinct preferences in Aim 2. A non-English version will be tested in an LEP group (n=20) with many speakers in the U.S., large health disparities from Aim 1, and known preferences from Aim 2.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will improve the science of consumer reporting of public hospital quality information by describing how individuals from diverse racial/ethnic groups and those with limited English proficiency use maternity- focused hospital quality information, what they value and understand from existing public reports on this topic, and whether additional information or presentation features might encourage higher use. We will use this information to design and test a personalized, consumer-focused website with the goal of improving the use of public hospital quality reports for pregnant women across diverse racial/ethnic and linguistic groups.            ",Hospital Quality Reports for Expectant Mothers: Considering Race and Language,8550004,R21HS021903,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R21,2013,316741,0.03572899616144202
"Using Quality Improvement to Benchmark and Reduce Disparities in Surgical Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Institute of Medicine defines the six pillars of 'quality' in health care as 'safe, effective, patient- centered, timely, efficient, and equitable'.In an effort to improve the delivery of health care nationwide, provider organizations have mounted numerous Quality Improvement initiatives. However, the achievement of equity remains a challenge as numerous reports document the persistence of disparities despite a wave of Quality Improvement programs. In this context, the delivery of surgical care is under the microscope at multiple levels and the measurement of surgical outcomes is becoming routine. While metrics to compare provider performance in other categories of 'quality' exist, there is currently no standardized method of benchmarking equity in surgical care. This is true despite extensive literature documenting disparate outcomes in surgical care in AHRQ priority populations such as racial and ethnic minorities. Our project addresses this critical barrier in tw critical steps: (1) demonstrating the feasibility of benchmarking racial and ethnic disparities in surgical care by developing and publishing an innovative methodology to capture nationwide variation in racial and ethnic disparities for three surgical procedures by hospital provider, and (2) characterizing hospital attributes that correlate with equitable performance. This project confirms the hypothesis that disparities in surgical care are not uniform across all providers. Our preliminary data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample reveal performance variation by hospital in the Observed likelihood of providing surgical procedures for racial and ethnic minority patients (i.e. Blacks, Hispanics) when compared to a risk-adjusted Expected likelihood of the same for nonminority White patients. This fundamentally challenges the popular paradigm that racial and ethnic disparities in surgery result primarily from patient factors such as socioeconomic status, insurance status, comorbidities, or even the genetics of race itself. In accordance with the AHRQ mission ""to enhance the quality of health care services for all Americans"", this project introduces a novel measurement tool for policy-makers and providers to benchmark disparities in surgical care and enables the deployment of Quality Improvement tools towards achieving equity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In accordance with the AHRQ mission to enhance the quality of health care services for all Americans, we propose a methodology to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in surgical care. Despite extensive documentation of disparities in surgery, organizations monitoring quality in surgical care do not currently report disparities to providers. Our project introduces a novel statistical model to benchmark variation in surgical disparities by provider to identify hospitals where the tools of Quality Improvement should be focused to promote equitable care for Priority Populations.                ",Using Quality Improvement to Benchmark and Reduce Disparities in Surgical Care,8593582,F32HS022398,[''],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2013,58442,0.014243615492736613
"Disparities in Incontinence and Perineal Skin Damage in Nursing Home Elders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a study of race, ethnic, and socioeconomic (SES) disparities as they relate to the development and management of incontinence, perineal dermatitis (PD), pressure ulcers (PUs) and associated quality of life in older nursing home (NH) residents. Reports of disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage and their management are a serious ethical and clinical concern warranting further investigation. Incontinence, PUs and PD are long-standing, widespread, and costly problems to which race, ethnic and SES disparities may contribute significantly. Annual treatment costs are in the billions of dollars, and each condition is significantly associated with psychological distress, physical discomfort, and lower quality of life. Complications of PUs can be fatal. Reducing health disparities offers a profound opportunity for improving the health of disadvantaged minority populations. Because health outcomes of NH residents and disparities in those outcomes are influenced by multiple factors at the individual, group NH, and community levels before and during a NH stay, investigation to detangle their contributions requires a multi-level approach. Previous studies have focused primarily on individual level resident characteristics or controlled for only a few NH factors; none has used a multi-level, multi-factoral approach. Because of our datasets, we are uniquely able to simultaneously measure factors at the individual, NH, and community levels that are associated with disparities in the development, prevention, and management of fecal and/or urinary incontinence, PD, PUs, and associated quality of life. We will analyze three large population datasets: Minimum Data Set (MDS) records and practitioner orders for all residents of a large, for-profit NH chain, the Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) files, and the US Census tract data. In addition, we will compare disparities in these health conditions and management plans in residents of the proprietary set of NHs with those in a set of national for-profit and non-profit NHs using a fourth database of MDS records (without practitioner orders) and OSCAR, and Census data in a multi-level sensitivity analysis. In so doing, we will provide context to our findings and strengthen our ability to make more informed recommendations. Our study will provide the best evidence to date about which of the many possible modifiable factors associated with disparities in these outcomes should be targeted for intervention and ascertain the level of their contribution. Therefore, our findings are critical before interventions aimed at reducing disparities in incontinence and perineal skin damage can be undertaken or successful.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of differences in the involuntary leakage of urine and stool, associated skin damage, and quality of life that exist because of race, ethnic background, and social and economic status of older nursing home residents. This study will also examine nursing home and community factors that may play a role in the occurrence, prevention, and management of these health problems that greatly reduce physical and

"Mechanisms for Enhancing Scholarly Achievements (MESA) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms for Enhancing Scholarly Achievements (MESA) Abstract The purpose of this randomized, controlled prospective-cohort-longitudinal study is to increase understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the transition of a diverse group of Academic Health Science Center graduate students who are enrolled in clinical programs of study (medicine, nursing, dentistry, allied health, and public health) into planned pursuit of a clinical research scientist career. The framework for this initial test of an integrated series of interventions designed to build interdisciplinary research teams has a cognitive learning theory assumptive base specifying intra-person and organization resources that make it possible to reach desired scholarly achievement goals despite exposure to learning anxiety and uncertainty that accompanies entry into a team science learning frame. The theory informed intervention strategies incorporate the following elements: "" Motivation direction and strength interventions to foster the development of personal research career goals; "" Faculty and community mentor pool that link student participation with an interdisciplinary research team; "" Research team building support to promote collaboration and healthy competition; "" Individual capacity building essential cognitive skills (problem solving, cognitive reframing, delay in gratification and belief in self relative to research self-efficacy); "" Participation across five semesters in team-based research projects directed toward health promotion/restoration for persons from vulnerable populations; "" A scholars' seminar series (across five semesters) focused on essential research content and proficiencies. Five aims and 10 linked hypotheses address a test of outcomes and modeling of the proposed learning process that begins with Motivator Direction and Strength and ends with Scholarly Activity and Career Path plan.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about the factors that influence the pursuit of a research career by minority persons. The proposed study will add to what is known about key elements, the mechanisms, which promote the achievement of successful research careers of minority persons who are returning for a graduate degree in medicine, nursing, dentistry, allied health and public health.

"A Layered, Multi-Agent System To Facilitate Healthcare Team Processes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Response to an Emergency Cesarean Delivery (ECD) at rural hospitals is complicated not only by inefficiencies in monitoring and early detection of fetal and/or maternal distress during labor, but by the conditions of the rural settin. Many rural hospitals lack the resources to have round-the-clock surgical staff and operating rooms reserved for cesarean delivery. Despite the availability of superior inexpensive technologies, an ECD team is often summoned to surgery using inadequate pager and telephone methods. People who must, or choose to, live in rural areas are no less deserving of timely and effective emergency obstetrical care than those in large cities. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality defines failure to Rescue, the lack of effectiveness and timeliness of actions taken once early medical complications are recognized, as one of the measures of quality of care. Delays in response as well as errors and omissions can lead to failures to rescue the fetus and mother, leading to increased mortality and neonatal morbidity. Based on preliminary work with an existing prototype, Bauer Labs proposes to test the feasibility and to conduct further research and the development of an intelligent e-summoning and enterprise management system aimed at coordinating the effective and timely assembly of the ECD team and the preparation of patients and operating room according to best practice guidelines. Our system has the capability to not only summon the surgical team, but also to facilitate communication among team members, coordinate team decisions, standardize preparation activities, and keep personnel informed of the status of the team, the patient, and the operating room. Furthermore, our system provides an interface between the electronic medical record (EMR), and commercially available asset management and patient tracking solutions aimed at providing needed decision and coordination support. In phase 1, we propose to: A) Fully evaluate the effectiveness and operability of the existing prototype under a simulated clinical ECD and gather input from users on further system development. B) Build a robust and reliable second generation prototype meeting the technical and operability requirements identified in the previous evaluation. C) Develop the methods to integrate patient medical information from the EMR into the summoning system using Bauer Lab's proprietary multi-agent system technology. D) Develop the interface between our system with off-the-shelf asset management and patient tracking solutions. E) Evaluate the effectiveness and operability of our system in reducing errors, increasing communication, and meeting the 30-minute ""decision-to-incision"" interval target during total team and hospital ECD simulation trials. The ultimate goal o this project is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using intelligent and integrated healthcare delivery management systems based on Bauer Lab's proprietary multi-agent system technology to prevent failures to rescue by intelligently integrating clinical, logistical, and operational information, and presenting it to the care team in a manner that integrates non-intrusively with the clinical workflow.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to capture detailed knowledge about clinical processes and use it in real-time to guide procedures, provide decision support, capture and display patient data, and alert the medical team to critical information will be a major improvement in the capabilities of the medical system, leading to the reduction of delays, omissions, and other errors during emergency surgical interventions. These improvements will reduce the time from decision-to-incision in Emergency Cesarean Delivery and reduce the likelihood of mishaps resulting in patient (mother and fetus) morbidity and mortality.            ","A Layered, Multi-Agent System To Facilitate Healthcare Team Processes",8547092,R43MD007121,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Engineering ', ' Equipment ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Fetus ', ' Goals ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Oregon ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' incision ', ' Otomy ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' medical complication ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Distress ', ' Visual ', ' Rural ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Simulate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' fetal ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' simulation ', ' member ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' ACOG ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' neonatal morbidity ', ' wound ', ' Trauma ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' Systems Development ', ' ']",NIMHD,"BAUER LABS, LLC",R43,2013,188975,0.014708448552084821
"UCLA/CDU Partnership for Enhancing Diversity of Nurses with Research Careers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities for individuals from under-represented minority groups (URMGs) continue to plague the US population. The roots of this problem are many and complex, but of great relevance is the dearth of individuals from URMGs in the health professions workforce, with serious disparities in the ethnic/racial composition of the workforce being particularly pronounced in nursing. The 2008 NSSRN survey showed 32.1% of Black/African American nurses and 39.4% of Latino nurses had baccalaureate degrees; for all racial/ethnic groups combined, only 11.4% had graduate degrees including PhDs. This state exists at a time when the US population is becoming older and more ethnically diverse. Given this dire state of affairs, we are proposing to enhance an existing relationship between the Schools of Nursing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU), an Historically Black Graduate Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution, for the purpose developing and implementing an integrated plan of individual and institutional activities to prepare masters students from URMGs to make a seamless transition to doctoral education. The long term goal of this project is to increase the ethnic/racial diversity of those prepared to pursue research careers in nursing focusing on research about aging adults (45+ years) by (1) increasing involvement of master's students and faculty at CDU SON in the scientific enterprise through structured development activities; (2) enriching the research course offerings and scientific environment at CDU SON to prepare master's students to seamlessly transition to doctoral education; and (3) facilitating student advancement to the UCLA SON via systems that facilitate student enrollment and scientific exchange between faculty at UCLA and CDU.           Health disparities persist despite efforts to curb them. Encouraging more diverse, underrepresented minority individuals to pursue doctoral education in the health care field, such as nursing, is one documented way to reduce health disparities. This application proposes collaboration between University of California Los Angeles and Charles Drew University to provide the supportive and educational activities required to prepare a more diverse nursing workforce at the doctoral level, who will ask the relevant research questions and develop the science that will ultimately reduce health disparities.

"Comparative effectiveness of home care environments for diverse elders' outcomes  Project Summary      The candidate is a community/public health nurse and gerontological health services researcher  committed to comparative effectiveness research on home health delivery systems. Her short-term training  objectives are (1) to develop comparative effectiveness research methods expertise and (2) data management  and analytic methods specific to home health care datasets and research design issues. Long term research  goals are to improve the design and deliver of home health nursing care outcomes for a rapidly aging and  increasingly diverse population. In addition to focused research, career development plans include interaction  with colleagues on her mentoring/research team, formal course work will be taken in comparative effectiveness  research methods. The University of Pennsylvania will provide an outstanding environment for her career  development. Resources include access to eminent interdisciplinary faculty who collaborate through focused  Research Centers in Health Services Research, Aging and Comparative Effectiveness Research, across the  Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Sociology, Statistics, and Business. Guided by excellent mentors, in a superb  training environment, with access to rich datasets and strong preliminary data, this proposal addresses three  specific aims: 1) Compare the effectiveness of nursing delivery system strategies (more nurses educated at  the baccalaureate level, ""front-loading"" of nursing visits, and supportive agency work environments) to improve  home health patient outcomes~ 2) Determine if and under what conditions the impact of nursing on home  health outcomes is contingent upon informal caregiver assistance~ and 3) Determine the extent of racial/ethnic  disparities in home health outcomes, and determine which nursing system delivery strategies are most likely to  be associated with improved outcomes for racial/ethnic minority patients and clinically complex older adults.     The proposed training and research will utilize the latest advances in comparative effectiveness  research methods to detect racial/ethnic disparities in home health outcomes, understand the contributing  factors (individual, family, community and health systems), and evaluate the comparative effectiveness of   nursing delivery system strategies on improving outcomes for home health patients under different individual  and socio-environmental circumstances. This innovative project will capitalize on a unique data set, comprised  of nurse surveys providing detailed information about nursing care and work environment within home health  agencies in nearly 250 home health agencies that serve older adults living in diverse communities. The nurse  survey results combined with independent home health care patient assessment and outcomes data provides  a window into each patient's unique circumstances, including the complexity and severity of their health status  and care needs, as well as information about their living environment and informal caregivers. Linkages with  additional administrative and public datasets will provide additional key variables regarding home health  agency service patterns and community measures of crime, segregation, socio-economic status and health  care provider availability/shortages. The proposed research is significant because it will highlight the value of  different home health nursing delivery strategies for improving patient outcomes among vulnerable populations  may be achieved. The challenge being addressed--how to best provide safe, effective, and affordable home  health nursing care to diverse patients--affects patient outcomes across the continuum of care from home to  medical home and hospital. Limited evidence is available to guide home health care systems administrators in  making decisions about the pros and cons of home health nursing delivery system strategies. The best  combination of home health nursing care delivery strategies may be categorically different depending on the  presence of informal family caregivers and community supports. Professional home health nursing care and  informal (lay) or community care may interact synergistically to increase the effectiveness of systems level  intervention, for example, by reducing the intensity of services needed. The comparative effectiveness study  proposed will form a critical body of evidence needed to translate effective nursing delivery system strategies  into evidence-based practice recommendations that providers, payers, purchasers, policy makers, other  principle investigators, and the public can trust.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine the relationships among nursing care delivery, the availability of informal caregivers, and patients' race and ethnicity on the health outcomes of older adults.

More recent data suggest that the number of minority nursing homes residents is increasing dramatically, while the number of white residents is declining. These new demographic changes raise concerns about whether nursing homes are able to serve appropriately the needs of patients with increasingly diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The quality of care delivered in nursing homes has been a longstanding issue plaguing the industry, and continues to be the focus of federal and state policies aimed at improving it. Extant evidence suggests that these policies, including strengthened state quality regulations, improved Medicaid reimbursements, and more recent efforts to foster market competition (e.g., the repeal of the Certificate of Need requirement; the national quality reporting), have improved nursing home quality and outcomes during the past decade. As the industry makes headway and improves quality in response to these policy and market trends, it is important to recognize that improvements in overall nursing home quality may not automatically benefit all subgroups of patients equally. Indeed, despite evidence of overall improvements, a large body of literature continues to document racial/ethnic disparities in nursing home quality. In particular, our recent work, published in the Journal of American Medical Association, has for the first time provided evidence that while pressure ulcer outcomes in nursing homes have improved for both non-Hispanic whites and minorities, the gap between these two groups of patients remained unchanged. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to answer two very important questions: 1) Does this phenomenon, of improvement in quality for all concomitant with a persistent gap between racial/ethnic groups, exist in other areas of known disparities for nursing home care? and 2) Can we identify specific policy and market characteristics that have been successful not only in improving quality but also in closing the racial and ethnic gap in quality? The proposed project will achieve these goals by investigating the longitudinal and cross sectional impact of each of three major types of nursing home quality drivers - state regulation of quality, Medicaid reimbursement, and market competition - on the racial/ethnic quality gap and its persistence. The information generated by this project will contribute to the knowledge regarding the ways with which major nursing home policies impact equity of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The proposed project will investigate the longitudinal and cross sectional impact of each of three major types of nursing home quality drivers - state regulation of quality, Medicaid reimbursement, and market competition - on the racial/ethnic quality gap and its persistence.                ",Impacts of nursing home competition & state policies on disparities in quality,8476905,R01MD007662,"['abstracting ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Certificate of Need ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Industry ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Patients ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Publishing ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2013,405530,0.07514040581430492
"Tense and Agreement in SAAE and SWE by Dialect Density and SLI Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the work is to examine the tense and agreement systems of children with and without specific language impairment (SLI) in Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). Although strides have been made in the study of SLI in SAAE and SWE, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of these dialects, and of the manifestations of SLI within them. These gaps in the literature create barriers to the representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this impedes the development of valid and efficient clinical services for children who speak these dialects. The focus of the work is on tense and agreement because recent findings from our lab and others indicate that nonstandard English-speaking children with SLI present difficulties with this aspect of language when compared to same dialect-speaking controls. These findings are consistent with two linguistic theories of SLI, the Extended Optional Infinitive account (EOI; Rice & Wexler, 1996; Rice, Wexler & Cleave, 1995) and the Feature-based Limited Functional Category account (F-LFC; Hegarty, 2005). Within the proposed work, we will further evaluate and specify the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE and complete four tests of the EOI and F-LFC models. The four tests involve: 1) the nature of the SLI tense and agreement deficit within SAAE and SWE; 2) the nature of the tense and agreement systems of typically developing children who vary in their nonstandard dialect use; 3) the relation between measures of children's tense and agreement systems and their general language ability, cognition, and environment; and 4) the relation between children's overt marking of tense and agreement and their overt marking of other functional categories (negation, complementizers) within an utterance. For the first three tests, the models make similar predictions but for the fourth, the models make different predictions. To achieve these goals, we will complete one large-scale study of 240 children in eight participant groups. These groups will allow us to compare same-dialect speaking children with and without SLI to each other (Test 1); evaluate differences between groups of typically developing children who produce low, medium, and high densities of SAAE and SWE (Test 2); complete regression analyses (Test 3); and complete a functional category analysis of utterances that contain tense and agreement, negation, and complementizers (Test 4). The data will come from language samples, standardized testing, and experimental probes as has been done in studies of standard English. However, to adequately evaluate the children's language systems and test the predictions of the EOI and F-LFC models within SAAE and SWE, we will create dialect-appropriate stimuli and dialect-appropriate coding systems. Findings from the work will lead to improved clinical services for children and a reduction of the health disparities that exist in the rural Deep South and elsewhere.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities exist for children who live in the rural Deep South. The proposed studies seek to learn more about children within these communities by focusing on the grammatical profile of SLI within Southern African American English (SAAE) and Southern White English (SWE). The findings should lead to a better understanding of the SLI grammar profile within these dialects while also providing four tests of two linguistic models of SLI. These findings should result in greater representation of SAAE- and SWE-speaking children within applied and theoretical research, and this should lead to improved clinical services and a reduction of health disparities for children who live in the rural Deep South and elsewhere.

"Understanding Disparities in Patient-Centered Hospital Care  Project Abstract Understanding the underlying causes of health disparities and developing effective methods to promote equitable health outcomes is a critical health policy goal. While we have substantial data showing large gaps in care between minority and non-minority patients, we have made little progress in eliminating these gaps. Previous studies indicate that optimal patient experiences with care may improve health outcomes and health status, and that minority patients report worse experiences with outpatient care than white patients. Yet, we have limited data on potential racial and ethnic disparities in patients' experiences in the hospital setting and factors that might explain these gaps. New national policy efforts, which aim to reward or penalize hospitals based on their performance on metrics of patient experience, create a need to understand whether hospitals that disproportionately care for minorities have worse performance and how we might intervene. Our work will examine both patient and hospital-level factors to better understand within and between hospital differences in patients' experiences and provide critically important data for interventions to promote equitable care. We propose to use patient-level data on patient experiences with hospital care from the HCAHPS database to examine four aims. We begin by examining whether there are racial or ethnic differences in care overall. We then examine the degree to which disparities in experience are due to ""within"" hospital differences, ""between"" hospital differences, or both. Our second aim will be to examine factors that explain or modify disparities within hospitals. Third, we will examine if the proportion of minority patients in a hospital is associated with hospital performance on patient experience metrics, and whether leadership's commitment to patient experience, financial health, and nurse staffing levels explain the relationship between proportion of minorities and patient experience. Finally, we will determine the role of these factors in improving patient experience over time. Our work will paint a national portrait of experiences of black, Hispanic, and white Americans in U.S. hospitals and provide timely data to ensure that national policies to improve care do not worsen disparities. We will quantify the degree to which disparities exist and whether they affect certain subgroups more than others. For example, if disparities in experience are most pronounced among the elderly or among hospitals with a large proportion of minority patients, these findings will provide targets for interventions. The analysis on institutional mediators should provide useful guidance about what interventions will most effectively reduce disparities in patient experience. Finally, our longitudinal analysis on how minority-serving hospitals improve over time will provide key insights about where to place future efforts to promote equitable, patient-centered care among all Americans.  Project Narrative Ensuring optimal patient experience, a centerpiece of delivering high quality care, is now an integral part of a major national policy effort to reward hospitals based on performance. Unfortunately, we lack empirical data to help policymakers and clinical leaders improve minorities' experiences and ensure equitable delivery of care. Our study, which aims to determine whether racial and ethnic minorities have worse experiences with hospital care than non-minorities and whether key factors explain racial and ethnic differences in patient experience, will provide important and actionable information to ensure that national policy efforts to improve hospital care promote equity as well as quality.",Understanding Disparities in Patient-Centered Hospital Care,8449590,R01MD006230,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Hospitals ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' Paint ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' payment ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Portraits ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' policy implication ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NIMHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2013,381628,0.06713720039884395
"The quality of care in minority serving hospitals explains cancer disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Does variation in the quality of care in minority serving hospitals explain cancer disparities? Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the US and the second most common cause of cancer death. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes are well documented in the literature, but there is little about the mechanisms that support and maintain disparities. More recent explanations suggest that the quality of care in hospitals where minorities cluster for treatment may play a role. Aims and Hypotheses: The overall objective of the current study is to assess clinical performance in the institutions where minorities cluster for colorectal cancer (CRC) care and elucidate how the quality of care in these settings correlate with outcome disparities. The central hypothesis is that minorities cluster for CRC care in hospitals with low compliance with evidence based care and higher complication rates; and that use of these hospitals, as well as the quality of care delivered therein, will explin some of the observed disparities in CRC. Methods: Retrospective data analysis of a large, all-state, all-age, all-payer administrative data set comprised a linkage between the California Cancer Registry, the California Patient Discharge and Hospital Annual Financial Data. Minority-serving hospitals (MSH) will be defined by density of black and Hispanic patients. These hospitals will be further characterized as to Medicaid utilization rates, annual surgical volume, National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer center designation; and performance on evidence based measures of care (12 lymph node examination, chemotherapy for stage III disease and preoperative staging for rectal cancer) and Patient safety indicator (PSI) rates (postoperative sepsis and respiratory failure). The AHRQ software will be used to calculate PSI rates. Analysis: A combination of Pearson chi-squared analysis will be used to define and characterize MSH and compare performance of MSH against other hospitals on quality measures and PSI's. Cox proportional hazard and multi- level (hierarchical) modeling will be used to assess the correlation of MSH use and performance on 5-year mortality. Multi-level modeling will be used to distinguish the effects of the hospital from the effects of patient characteristics on mortality           Does variation in the quality of care in minority serving hospitals explain cancer disparities? The current proposal investigating variation in the quality o care in minority serving hospitals has public health relevance because these hospitals not only serve minorities, but also serve the poor and uninsured. As the rate of un- and underinsurance increases across the country, and as the implementation of health care reform begins, the results of our study may inform policy to improve cancer care and reduce cancer disparities.

"Estimating Hospital Outcome Quality: Applications to Pay-for-Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will pursue two major areas of research related to quality measurement and payment policy reform to improve value in healthcare. The first pertains to the evaluation and design of estimators of outcome quality and cost in order to profile the performance of healthcare providers. This research will evaluate the performance of existing estimators of outcome performance, propose new estimators, and validate the performance of these estimators to profile the quality, cost, and efficiency of hospitals and physician practices. The second area of research I will pursue is an evaluation of the Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) hospital-based pay-for-performance (P4P) program. I will test the effect of the P4P program on quality and cost for the areas incentivized in the program (maternity and newborn care, community acquired pneumonia, surgical infection prevention, pediatric asthma). I will also estimate the effect of the program on racial and ethnic disparities. To evaluate the performance of outcome measures, a simulation model will be constructed and a series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments will be designed and implemented. The basic approach is as follows: hypothetical providers are randomly assigned a ""true"" outcome score, a performance improvement trajectory, a patient risk score, a sample size, and a sample size trajectory. A random shock, inversely associated with sample size, is then created for each provider. Observed outcome scores, derived as a function of true outcome quality, patient risk, and the random shock are created for each hospital. Using only information on observed outcomes, true outcomes are then estimated using the candidate outcome estimators and the performance of these estimators is compared. The performance of these estimators will then be validated for hospitals and physicians using national Medicare data and data from Massachusetts. To evaluate the effect of the MassHealth program on quality, costs, and racial and ethnic disparities, I will draw on methods employed in my previous research. This will involve the use of panel data econometric techniques to test whether Massachusetts hospitals increased quality and decreased cost for MassHealth patients after the program was implemented. To examine the effect of the program on disparities, I will test for reductions in both within-hospital disparities in quality and between-hospital disparities in quality after the program was implemented. The skills and knowledge required to pursue my proposed research will be bolstered by an outstanding group of mentors and a robust education and career development plan. My mentors are leaders in the fields of payment and financing of healthcare, quality measurement, organizational research, health economics, and comparative effectiveness. Further, my mentors employ insights and perspectives from economics, political science, sociology, and clinical practice in their research, providing a rich and diverse intellectual environment from which I can draw upon as a mentee. In following my career development plan, I will enhance my methodological and programming skills, learn more about the responsible conduct of research, acquire knowledge of clinical practice and medical organization, and present my research findings and interact with colleagues at several national conferences. Research that successfully fulfills the aims of my K01 proposal will have important policy relevance. The proposed research will add to our knowledge about the use of outcome measures in pay-for-performance and public quality reporting while also providing further evidence about the effectiveness of pay-for- performance through the evaluation of the Massachusetts program. While ambitious, my track record of research achievement shows that I am capable of conducting research that achieves these aims. Further, the coursework and applied research conducted for the K01 will augment my research skills, enhancing my ability to achieve these aims. After collaborating with my mentors on this research, I will be have established myself as a researcher in the fields of P4P and quality measurement, positioning myself for R01 grants in these areas.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project has the potential to positively impact public health by creating more accurate estimators of healthcare provider outcome quality and cost and by contributing to the understanding of the effect of hospital-based pay-for-performance. This research can be used to design payment policy that creates stronger incentives for value and quality improvement in healthcare.

"The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality of treatment for cancer-associated complications, those complications directly attributable to the cancer itself or that result from chemotherapy and/or radiation, have received little attention. This is particularly problematic as cancer-associated complications are associated with significant morbidity, are often accompanied by pain and discomfort, and require the expenditure of substantial healthcare resources for treatment. The management of cancer-associated complications is compounded by the availability of a myriad of treatment options, many of which are unproven and associated with significant cost. Little is known about the factors that influence allocation of care for thes complications and what factors influence outcome. The health care a patient receives and its associated outcomes are influenced by the interplay of a number of patient, physician, and hospital factors. For acute inpatient medical conditions the characteristics of the hospital in which a patient is treated play a crucial role. There is growing recognition that there is widespread between-hospital variation in how care is allocated and that these differences in practice patterns explain a large portion of treatment variability. Uninsured and minority patients are particularly vulnerable to these hospital level disparities as these patients are disproportionately more likely to receive care at facilities with limited clinical and financial resources that may adversely affect quality. In this proposal we will determine the quality of treatment for hospitalized patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of: febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia of malignancy, esophagitis, and acute cancer-associated pain. For each cancer-associated complication we will determine patterns of treatment, the factors that underlie treatment decisions, and the effect of prompt initiation of guideline-based therapy on outcomes. For each condition we will first examine the utilization of guideline-based and non-indicated treatments. We will then comprehensively examine the influence of patient, physician, and hospital characteristics as well as between- hospital variations on the allocation of guideline-based care. We hypothesize that there is substantial variation in treatment between hospitals that is unexplained by traditional measures. Finally, we will perform novel causal inference and mediation analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects operating through a mediator of prompt guideline-based treatment on outcomes (length of stay, readmission, cost, non-routine discharge and mortality) for each complication. In addition to including a number of novel statistical methodologies, this proposal will utilize a unique database ideally suited to the study of these complications. The data from these studies will lead to immediately actionable results that can be used to guide the implementation pragmatic hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To date, the complications that result either directly from cancer or from its treatment have received almost no attention. Our findings will provide important data on the management of these complications to patients, providers, and payers that are immediately actionable and can guide the development of targeted hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications.                ",The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp,8457724,R01CA169121,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Expenditure ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neutropenia ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Consensus ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' novel ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Treatment-Associated Cancer ', ' Therapy-Related Cancer ', ' Therapy-Associated Cancers ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Tumor ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Iatrogenic Cancer ', ' Treatment-Related Cancer ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' chemotherapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' common treatment ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,332000,-0.01548694870834524
"Hospital Care Environment, Neighborhood, and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are well-documented racial and ethnic disparities in the costly and often preventable outcomes of mortality, readmission, and prolonged hospitalization due to the common conditions of heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction. The causes and solutions for these disparities, however, are not clear. Evidence has begun to point toward differences in the hospitals where most minorities and non- minorities receive care as a source of disparities. Surprisingly, two important factors and their interrelationship, which may explain how hospital differences are associated with disparities and point to opportunities for targeted intervention, have received insufficient attention: the quality of nursing in the hospital in which patients are cared for and the characteristics of the neighborhoods of patients served by different hospitals. Nurses  provide vital bedside care, 24/7 surveillance, education, and care coordination that may narrow disparity gaps,  but little is known about the degree to which minority patients are treated in hospitals with lower quality nursing  and the effect of these differences on disparities. Nursing as a systems factor is an appealing feature to study because unlike many hospital characteristics, it can be improved through intervention by administrators or policymakers. Evidence suggests that most minority older adults are cared for in a relatively small proportion of hospitals. The quality of the nursing care environment (including nurse staffing level, level of nurse education, and a care environment supportive of professional nursing practice) can vary significantly from hospital to hospital and these factors affect patient outcomes. If differences in nursing care environment are shown to be associated with disparities, strategies targeting nursing in hospitals that predominantly serve minority- populations could be implemented.  We must also consider that outcomes variation by hospital may reflect differences in the populations that different hospitals treat. Although researchers often account for differences in individual characteristics, the effect of the hospital environment is rarely examined in relation to the effect of the neighborhood where patients live. Research shows that the socio-ecological qualities of an older adult's neighborhood (e.g., socioeconomic position, segregation, and primary care services availability) impact health outcomes. In addition to an independent effect, we expect that neighborhood factors affect older adults' access to high-quality hospital services including quality nursing care. We will use multilevel and cross-classified models as well as geographic information systems (GIS) methods to examine unique survey data from hospital nurses along with Medicare claims data that is geocoded and linked with neighborhood data.  Our approach will allow us to untangle the interrelated effects of the hospital care environment and patient neighborhood on racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes among older adults, point to interventions that may reverse disparities, and identify communities and hospitals that can most benefit from interventions.         Racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes for older adults are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By examining the inter-related effects of the  hospital care environment and the neighborhoods from which hospitals draw patients, our study will help  explain previously unexplored causes of racial and ethnic disparities, inform efforts to improve the hospital care  environment, and target limited resources to the hospitals and communities that could most benefit from them.

"Academic Career Award in Complementary and Alternative Medicine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NCCAM's 2005 Strategic Plan includes the exploration of organized health care delivery models which integrate complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) with conventional care. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey reports that approximately one in five adults use Herbs and non-vitamin Dietary Supplements (HDS). However, little is known about the number of inpatients in urban underserved hospitals who continue to use HDS while receiving treatment with allopathic medicines. Similarly, little is known about factors associated with potential HDS adverse events in hospital settings. Health information technology holds promise as an innovative and effective way to deliver HDS information to underserved patients and their physicians. This K07 application proposes essential first steps toward (1) developing a solid knowledge base about HDS use in underserved hospital patients, and (2) designing and piloting innovative methods to effectively deliver evidenced-based HDS information to underserved inpatients and their physicians, in particular through health information technology. The research objectives of this application are: (1) to contribute to the knowledge base about HDS use among minority inpatients; (2) to design culturally sensitive literacy-informed patient-centered information technology systems to teach about HDS; and (3) to develop a patient safety curriculum that will help clinicians document HDS use and communicate effectively with their patients about HDS. To achieve these objectives, this K07 application has three specific aims: (1) Investigate the association between HDS use, health literacy, medication use, and hospital utilization in a sample of 750 hospitalized patients; (2) Conduct a randomized clinical trial in sixty women who will receive a hospitalized discharge plan on cranberry delivered by a virtual patient advocate (a computerized, animated, empathic character), and a control group who receives the same information via a cranberry patient information sheet; and (3) Design, program, and evaluate a web-based HDS patient safety curriculum for clinicians, then utilize pre and post measures and chart reviews to assess its impact on clinician-patient HDS communication. Completion of this research will be supported by: (1) a core of highly skilled mentors and consultants; and (2) completion of a Graduate Certificate in Instructional Technology at the Boston University School of Education. The candidate's career goals are to become (1) an independent HDS research investigator and educator for underserved populations, and (2) a national leader in the use of health information technology for HDS patient and clinician education. To prepare herself to accomplish these career goals, as well as the research objectives outlined above, the candidate proposes (1) to undertake mentored training in patient safety, health care disparities, health literacy, and epidemiologic methods, and (2) to pursue course-working clinical trial design, statistical analysis, human subject protections, and online curriculum development. This award will effectively prepare the candidate to become a successful independently-funded HDS investigator, focused on the needs of underserved patients, and an expert in applying health information technology to the study and teaching of CAM.

"Improving Nursing Home Compare to Meet the Needs of Minority Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elders and potential users of nursing home public report cards do not have uniform care needs or information preferences. Yet little is known about how information use, needs, and preferences vary across population groups. Further, no nursing home report cards present performance measures stratified by race/ethnicity. The goals of this study are to identify ways in which Nursing Home Compare (NHC) can be improved to better meet the needs and preferences of minority populations and to test NHC measure stratification by race/ethnicity. To this end, this study seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1 Collect feedback from minority elders, caregivers, and other stakeholders on their opinions of NHC and about how the report cards might be changed to better suit their needs and priorities; 2. Use existing data to create NHC performance measures stratified by population group and a set of related disparities measures and determine the statistical relevance and feasibility of such measures; 3. Determine whether different population members find measure stratification and disparities measures useful in seeking nursing home care. This study will focus on the nursing home public reporting needs and preferences of African American/black elders and Hispanic/Latino elders. Initial consumer feedback on needs and preferences will be collected through focus groups and interviews with elders and family members of these groups, in addition to non-Hispanic white elders and family members and discharge planners. Data from the Minimum Data Set regarding resident characteristics and outcomes will be used to create several forms of NHC performance indicators, stratified by population group, and a set of related disparities measures. Statistical testing and trends analysis will be conducted to ascertain the relevance and feasibility of stratifying measures. Finally, these measures will be presented to the different population group members to collect data on their opinions of the usefulness and value of such measures.          Makers of private and public report cards can use the findings from this study to understand how information needs and preferences vary by race/ethnicity and to inform efforts to increase report card use among these groups. Policymakers and nursing home administrators can use the findings to understand the extent to which care varies by population group within facilities. Findings will also provide insight into the statistical feasibiity of using stratified and disparities measures in nursing home public reporting, as well as consumers' perceived value such information has in making nursing home decisions.

"Comparing language profiles of AAE-speaking children in poverty to those with SLI  Abstract Children reared in poverty and those diagnosed with language impairments both perform poorly on standardized measures of language. Yet, the cause of poor performance for the groups is considered quite different, limited experiences and/or test bias as compared to faulty language systems. Further complicating the research is the fact that children from low-income backgrounds often speak a nonmainstream dialect. The goal of the current work is to address these issues by differentiating the language profiles of children from low- income backgrounds and those diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in narrowly defined groups. To accomplish this, we will evaluate past tense marking in four groups of African American English (AAE)-speaking children: 6-year old children from low-income backgrounds, their typically developing age- matched peers from middle income backgrounds, their typically developing language-matched peers from middle income backgrounds, and their typically developing age-matched peers diagnosed with SLI. The children's language abilities will be evaluated using spontaneous language sampling and established protocols for past tense and passive marking. Comparing group performance on these grammatical measures will further test whether the two groups demonstrate general language difficulties or more specific language difficulties (e.g., grammar or vocabulary). Such outcomes will contribute to advances in understanding individual variation across language profiles, further enhancing our diagnostic accuracy of SLI.  Public Health Relevance Statement Health disparities exist for children reared in poverty. The goal of the proposed studies is to uncover the effects of poverty on language in a group of African American children from low-income families and those diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment. By focusing our efforts on their grammatical profiles, our results should lead to improved clinical services for African American children, thus reducing health disparities.",Comparing language profiles of AAE-speaking children in poverty to those with SLI,8517642,R03DC012141,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Language ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Intelligence ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language Tests ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Michigan ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Poverty ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Morphology ', ' Nature ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' regional difference ', ' Neurologic status ', ' Neurological status ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' 6 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' standardize measure ', ' child poverty ', ' ']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2013,142025,0.054447432734720316
"Racial disparities in access to high quality hospitals for coronary heart disease The primary goal of this K08 application is to support Dr loana Popescu to become an independent investigator in the area of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. The application will involve the assimilation of new methodological skills and the analysis of a number of existing health care databases. In support of the application, Dr. Popescu has assembled a team of experienced mentors-Drs. Gary Rosenthal (Department of Internal Medicine), Gerald Rushton (Geography), and Kevin Leicht (Sociology), who bring expertise in complementary methodological areas and who have assisted Dr. Popescu in designing integrated plans for career development and research. The Career Plan includes advanced training in: 1) hierarchical biostatistical modeling and clinical research ethics; 2) the application of spatial analysis and geographic information systems methods in health care; and 3) methods for measuring residential segregation and understanding its sociological roots. These goals will be accomplished through targeted coursework, tutorials, directed readings, and direct research experiences guided by her mentors. The Research Plan will examine the interplay between geography, segregation and health care system factors, in order to build a comprehensive understanding of why black patients are less likely to receive care for acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass surgery in high quality hospitals. The Research Plan includes three incremental aims that capitalize on a number of national data sources, including: Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims files; US Census data; American Hospital Association surveys; the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile; and DartmouthAtlas health care market data. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between race, proximity to the admitting and to high quality hospitals, and the likelihood of admission to high quality hospitals. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of residential segregation on disparities in admissions to high quality hospitals. Aim 3 will examine the effects of patterns of prior outpatient care on disparities in admission to high quality hospitals and will build Dr. Popescu's fluency in analyzing more complex outpatient physician claims files. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Despite sustained national attention, significant gaps remain in research on causes of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. The proposed projects will bring an important contribution to elucidating the geographic and social context factors contributing to these persistent disparities.

"An Analysis of the Impact of Linguistic and Paralinguistic Variables in Mediated    DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant):  Of the financial, structural, and personal barriers that limit access to healthcare, language is one of the most persistent. Despite this, empirical research delving into the complexities of mediated (interpreted) human interaction in healthcare settings is scarce, and many of the studies that do exist pose serious limitations when considered in the light of current linguistic theoretical frameworks. The influx of language-minority patients into the U.S. health system has led to a flurry of interest in the healthcare interpreter by medical researchers, with a number of studies in recent years being conducted to compare the performance of ad hoc interpreters to ""professional"" interpreters; to analyze misunderstanding and breakdown in communication caused by interpreters; and to develop approaches to testing the language proficiency and interpreting skills of healthcare interpreters. These studies have been carried out in isolation, with little input from the science of linguistics, in which studies in interaction have been conducted for decades. They fail to tease apart important variables related to the profile of the interpreter and provider, and to the interactional goals of particular communicative events in healthcare. The purpose of this research is to improve healthcare access provided to language minority patients (speakers of Spanish and ASL, in particular) by revealing some of the underlying obstacles (linguistic contributors) to healthcare patient-provider interaction. These contributors will be identified through qualitative and quantitative data collection approaches, including video recorded provider-patient encounters at a large hospital in south Texas. Demographics will also be collected on providers, patients, and interpreters and relationships between their profiles and linguistic contributors to miscommunication will be explored. This research is grounded in concepts derived from interactional sociolinguistics and conversation analysis.           Project Narrative Although language is discussed frequently in the literature as one of the major contributors to health disparities, empirical research delving into the complexities of mediated (interpreted) human interaction in healthcare settings is scarce. This study will explore and compare interpreted and non-interpreted interaction in healthcare settings, with a specific focus on breakdowns in communication. Qualitative and quantitative analyses will be conducted to identify linguistic contributors to miscommunication and their correlation with interpreter, provider, and patient profiles.

"RISE Program Option I: University of Puerto Rico at Cayey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The RISE program continues to transform the academic environment at UPR-Cayey by focusing on the preparation of students to become scientists. As part of this long term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in four areas, 1- their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, 2- their limited research skills and experience, 3- limited quantitative and qualitative skills, and 4- limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, five developmental activities are prescribed- visiting scientists, research skills, discovery chemistry, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting alumni scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. RISE students will take Discovery Chemistry to quantitative and qualitative skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 60 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the USA. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: 1) research and language skills with faculty mentors; 2) motivational visiting alumni scientists; 3) inquiry methodology by chemistry faculty and 4) research lab experience with either on- island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the USA.

"Impact of Physician non-English Language Proficiency Level on Cancer Screening     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Impact of Physician non-English Language Proficiency Level on Cancer Screening Project Summary/Abstract Communication between patients and clinicians is an essential component of cancer screening. Ineffective communication can lead to patient misunderstanding of the importance of cancer screening or disagreement with it, leading to poor adherence. Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) are at risk of disparities in cancer screening because of impaired communication with their clinicians. True language concordance occurs when clinicians are fluent in the languages their patients speak and offers an important way to reduce disparities for LEP patients. All too often though, there is only partial language concordance between patients and clinicians because the clinician does not speak the patient's language fluently but does not use an interpreter. When there is only partial language concordance, there are concerns for the quality of care provided. The goal upon completion of the proposed studies is to have evidence that will help establish standards for testing of, and allowing practice with, clinician non-English language proficiency and to reduce language-related disparities in cancer screening. The specific aims for this application are (1) To determine if a detailed self-reporting scale of clinician language proficiency correlates to the results of a validated oral proficiency test, (2) To explore clinicia characteristics that are predictors of accuracy in self-assessment of non-English language proficiency; (3) To assess whether breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening completion rates are higher for LEP patients with truly language concordant clinicians compared to those with partially language concordant clinicians. To achieve these aims, the proposed studies will first compare clinicians' self-assessment of their non-English language proficiency using the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) scale compared to the Clinician Cultural and Linguistic Assessment (CCLA), a gold standard, validated oral proficiency test. The two measures will be analyzed using quantile-quantile plots of the two distributions, the ILR and the CCLA. The analysis will also employ Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to assess the consistency of the ILR and the CCLA. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess the relationship between obtaining a passing score on the CCLA and spoken language history and provider demographic variables. Next, exploratory univariate and subsequent multivariate analyses will be performed to ascertain which factors are associated with the over- or underestimation of non-English language proficiency by clinicians. Finally, analyses will be conducted to assess the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency on breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. Hierarchical/multilevel modeling will be employed to account for patient, clinician and system level factors, with separate models conducted for each type of cancer screening. Level one will assess the probability of completing cancer screening at the patient level, including the covariates listed above. Level 2 will account for clinician factors listed above and level 3 will include clinician work sites.

"Effect of Emergency Care Availability on Racial Disparities in Access & Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial differences in the burden of cardiovascular disease contribute significantly to health disparities observed in the United States. Timely access to emergency care is critical for diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF), yet access to emergency departments (EDs) varies substantially across communities. The deterioration of ED access, due to either ED closure or crowding (henceforth ""ED access block""), is associated with increased mortality rates. It has been posited that ED closures may improve acute care by removing poor-performers in a competitive market such that there is a tradeoff between distance traveled and quality of care. The risk of this assumption however, is that if ED closures occur mainly in minority communities, there could be differential effects on minority communities. We seek to fill this gap in the literature. Our long-term goal is to identify system-level mechanisms in emergency care delivery that contribute to disparities across various segments of the population. Our objectives are (1) to identify whether ED access block is a possible contributor to the widening of process and health outcome disparities between black and white patients with CHF and AMI; and (2) whether improved access (as a result of ED openings) may reduce disparities. We will link Medicare claims, hospital surveys, location data, and daily ambulance diversion logs from 2001 to 2010 to address the following Specific Aims (sample size is ~6 million admissions): Aim 1: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority patients relative to others within a community and whether ED openings can reduce those disparities. We hypothesize that ED access block results in a higher percentage of black patients being admitted to facilities with lower level technology, receiving inferior treatment, and experiencing worse patient outcomes as compared to white patients. Aim 2: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority-serving hospitals and whether ED openings can reduce disparities. We hypothesize that minority-serving hospitals are disproportionately burdened with a higher patient load and experience deteriorating quality relative to other facilities with the same level of ED access block. Aim 3: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority-heavy communities and whether ED openings can reduce disparities. We hypothesize that minority-heavy communities experience reduced technology access and quality relative to others when exposed to ED access block. Achieving these aims will offer an unusually complete picture of the potential mechanisms through which disparities can occur at patient-, facility-, and community-levels. Such mechanisms will inform policy makers whether certain measures are needed to improve efficiency of care and minimize disparities. Our framework can be applied broadly to investigate other types of disparities where ED access is critical.          The objective of the research is to determine whether emergency department closures or crowding widens racial disparities in access and outcomes at patient-, facility-, and community-levels; and whether improved access as a result of ED opening can reduce such disparities. Health policies aiming to improve efficiency of care delivery can have unintended consequences of widening health disparities. Our results will offer an unusually complete picture of the potential mechanisms through which disparities can occur at different levels of care delivery, as well as inform policies with specific measures that may be applied to minimize disparities.

"Identifying Ways to Reduce Readmissions Among Minority-Serving U.S. Hospitals     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia are three of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the Medicare program, and each is associated with high 30-day readmission rates. Although readmissions are common across all patient groups, black patients are more likely than white patients to be readmitted for reasons that are not well understood. The site of care likely plays an important role: care for minorities is concentrated among a small number of minority-serving hospitals (MSHs), which provide a lower quality of care and have worse outcomes, including higher readmission rates. However, even among MSHs, there are large variations: in preliminary analyses, we found three-fold variations in readmission rates (e.g. for AMI, 12.2% in the best versus 35.7% in the worst quartile) with some MSHs achieving results comparable to the best hospitals nationally. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made reducing readmissions a priority by requiring that Medicare lower payments to hospitals with high readmission rates and in preliminary analyses for this proposal, we found that MSHs have nearly three times greater odds of being in the worst quartile of performance nationally. If these hospitals fail to improve, the new policy is likely to worsen existing disparities in care. However, we know little about why some MSHs have low readmission rates while others lag behind. Helping MSHs reduce readmissions is critically important, but we lack the empirical data to make evidence-based recommendations. We propose to examine key patient-, hospital-, and market-level factors that explain the large variations in readmission among MSHs, and determine if the presence of these factors explains gaps in performance between MSHs and non-MSHs. We will use case studies to characterize readmission prevention practices at MSHs with the highest and lowest risk-adjusted readmission rates. We will then use a national survey of hospital Chief Medical Officers to create the first national picture of current knowledge, priorities, and programs around readmissions. Finally, we will use administrative databases to examine the degree to which these factors explain variations in readmissions among MSHs, whether the important factors we identify also explain variation at non-MSHs, and whether they explain disparities between non-MSHs and MSHs. Understanding the substantial variations in readmission rates among MSHs will allow us to identify key factors that are actionable and relevant to MSHs. These data will help policymakers craft effective and novel interventions help MSHs improve care for all their patients, thus reducing disparities in readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia are three of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the Medicare program, and each is associated with high 30-day readmission rates. Black patients have higher readmission rates than white patients for these conditions, and much of this difference is driven by site of care: minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) have higher rates of readmissions than non-MSHs. Even within MSHs, there are nearly three-fold differences in readmission rates, suggesting there are ample opportunities to improve. Our study will use a mixed-methods approach, including case studies, a national survey of hospital Chief Medical Officers, and multilevel modeling with Medicare data, to understand patient-, hospital-, and market-level factors that impact rates of readmissions at MSHs, with the goal of identifying actionable factors that could help policymakers craft effective policies to improve care among these providers and reduce racial disparities in this important health outcome.            ",Identifying Ways to Reduce Readmissions Among Minority-Serving U.S. Hospitals,8451895,R01HL113567,"['Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Leadership ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Prevention ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2013,543195,0.0290755544839599
"Performance of High Medicaid Nursing Homes-Contextual and Management Factors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Equitable access to high quality nursing home care for older and disabled populations is an important public policy issue given the aging and increasingly diverse U.S. population. Nursing home care has been described as a two-tiered system with the lower tier consisting of facilities housing predominantly Medicaid residents. These facilities are likely to have a higher proportion of minorities, and report lower quality car and operate in a resource constrained environment as their payer mix is predominantly Medicaid with lower reimbursement rates than Medicare and private pay. However, we observe performance variations across these resource-constrained facilities in both quality and financial performance.  The proposed study will focus on the role of structural, market, and management factors in explaining quality and financial performance variations among nursing homes with high Medicaid census (>85%). Using a mixed methods approach, our study will address the following research aims: 1) Examine the structural and market factors associated with high performance among nursing homes with high Medicaid census. 2) Examine the association of management factors (leadership style, strategic orientation, HRM practices, and knowledge management) with high performance among nursing homes with high Medicaid census. 3) Examine whether nursing staff turnover mediates the relationship between management factors (leadership style and HRM practices) and performance among these nursing homes. 4) Explore how and why the factors tested in Specific Aims 1-3 may influence high performance from the perspectives of nursing staff and nursing home management.  Our study is innovative in that it will be the first mixed methods study to explore contextual factors that may explain performance differences among facilities with high Medicaid census. This study will use a mixed methods, sequential explanatory design, consisting of two distinct phases, quantitative followed by qualitative. The quantitative analysis will use secondary data as well as survey data. The analytic sample for the survey will consist of managers from approximately 1000 nursing homes with high Medicaid census, and the qualitative sample will consist of interviews with nursing staff (6) and managers (2) from eight nursing homes (high and low performance) for a total of 64 interviews in 4 states (California, Georgia, New York, and Texas).  The study findings will allow policymakers and nursing home managers to better understand the structural, market, and management factors associated with better performance in resource-constrained nursing facilities. We believe that the findings of our study and their dissemination will provide an impetus for developing interventions to improve the performance of these facilities in terms of lower costs and better quality. This may, in turn, reduce health care disparities for low income, minority, elderly, and disabled residents in these facilities, which are among AHRQ's priority populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study will facilitate interventions aimed at improving the performance of low performing nursing facilities in terms of lower costs and better quality.  These interventions can, in turn, reduce health care disparities for low income, minority, elderly, and disabled nursing home residents, which are among AHRQ's priority populations.            ",Performance of High Medicaid Nursing Homes-Contextual and Management Factors,8749185,R01HS023345,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2014,1249873,0.027183143473424407
"Understanding Racial and Geographic Disparities in Hospital Observation Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last decade, observation care-a hospital-based outpatient service used to evaluate and treat acutely ill patients for extended periods-has become an increasingly common, but controversial, alternative to full hospitalization affecting more than 1 million Medicare beneficiaries annually (National Center for Health Statistics 2010; Feng et al. 2012). Proponents argue that observation care represents an alternative to short- stay hospitalization (< 48 hours) and a net cost savings to the health system, while critics argue that observation care shifts the cost burden of expensive inpatient care onto patients, and may compromise the quality of care (Baugh et al. 2011; Ross and Bellamy 2010). There is also significant variation in observation care use-including racial and geographic disparities-and it is unclear both what drives these disparities and whether observation care results in better or worse patient-centered outcomes than short-stay hospitalizations (Feng et al. 2012). Thus, the overall objective of this study is to understand the causes of racial and geographic disparities in the use of observation care among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and the implications of these disparities for patient-centered outcomes. In pursuit of this objective, the proposed study has the following specific aims: 1) To determine the extent to which disparities in observation care are driven by patient and hospital level factors; and 2) To assess the association between observation care and patient- centered outcomes by race and rurality. To achieve these aims, four years of Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims and enrollment data (2007-2010) will be used to model observation stay rates as a function of variation in patient race and rurality within and between hospitals. Then, the 30- and 90-day ED visit, hospital readmission, and mortality rates of patients placed in observation care versus those placed in short-stay admission (d 48 hours) will be evaluated, controlling for a variety of factors including patient comorbidities. Heterogeneity in the impact of observation on outcomes by race and rurality will also be evaluated. The proposed research is significant because it will indicate whether disparities in health outcomes could potentially be reduced by policies that address disparities in observation care use, and whether policy strategies to reduce disparities in the use of observation care should be targeted towards individuals, system-level factors, or both. The proposed research is innovative because it uses comprehensive national person-level Medicare claims data to investigate racial and geographic disparities in the use of observation care to identify both its upstream and downstream consequences, and will assess for the first time the impact of the decision to admit or observe on health outcomes. This study is expected to have an immediate positive impact on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) policymakers, payers, providers, and hospitals as they develop policies on the appropriate use of observation care. As these policies are implemented by CMS and other payers to improve the quality of care and reduce disparities, patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries of this researc.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to clarify the causes of racial and geographic disparities in the use of observation care and identify the consequences of these disparities for a variety of subsequent health outcomes. In particular, the results are expected to inform the development of policies on the appropriate use of observation care, which may help control health care costs and ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries get access to the most appropriate and effective care for their condition. The project is relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Aging because it focuses on understanding and eliminating racial and geographic disparities affecting the health and health care of older adults.            ",Understanding Racial and Geographic Disparities in Hospital Observation Care,8660213,R21AG047102,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cost shifting ', ' development policy ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.) ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Time ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Hour ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' beneficiary ', ' critical access hospital ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2014,253470,-0.01938169454672915
"UCLA/CDU Partnership for Enhancing Diversity of Nurses with Research Careers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities for individuals from under-represented minority groups (URMGs) continue to plague the US population. The roots of this problem are many and complex, but of great relevance is the dearth of individuals from URMGs in the health professions workforce, with serious disparities in the ethnic/racial composition of the workforce being particularly pronounced in nursing. The 2008 NSSRN survey showed 32.1% of Black/African American nurses and 39.4% of Latino nurses had baccalaureate degrees; for all racial/ethnic groups combined, only 11.4% had graduate degrees including PhDs. This state exists at a time when the US population is becoming older and more ethnically diverse. Given this dire state of affairs, we are proposing to enhance an existing relationship between the Schools of Nursing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU), an Historically Black Graduate Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution, for the purpose developing and implementing an integrated plan of individual and institutional activities to prepare masters students from URMGs to make a seamless transition to doctoral education. The long term goal of this project is to increase the ethnic/racial diversity of those prepared to pursue research careers in nursing focusing on research about aging adults (45+ years) by (1) increasing involvement of master's students and faculty at CDU SON in the scientific enterprise through structured development activities; (2) enriching the research course offerings and scientific environment at CDU SON to prepare master's students to seamlessly transition to doctoral education; and (3) facilitating student advancement to the UCLA SON via systems that facilitate student enrollment and scientific exchange between faculty at UCLA and CDU.           Health disparities persist despite efforts to curb them. Encouraging more diverse, underrepresented minority individuals to pursue doctoral education in the health care field, such as nursing, is one documented way to reduce health disparities. This application proposes collaboration between University of California Los Angeles and Charles Drew University to provide the supportive and educational activities required to prepare a more diverse nursing workforce at the doctoral level, who will ask the relevant research questions and develop the science that will ultimately reduce health disparities.

"Academic Career Award in Complementary and Alternative Medicine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NCCAM's 2005 Strategic Plan includes the exploration of organized health care delivery models which integrate complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) with conventional care. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey reports that approximately one in five adults use Herbs and non-vitamin Dietary Supplements (HDS). However, little is known about the number of inpatients in urban underserved hospitals who continue to use HDS while receiving treatment with allopathic medicines. Similarly, little is known about factors associated with potential HDS adverse events in hospital settings. Health information technology holds promise as an innovative and effective way to deliver HDS information to underserved patients and their physicians. This K07 application proposes essential first steps toward (1) developing a solid knowledge base about HDS use in underserved hospital patients, and (2) designing and piloting innovative methods to effectively deliver evidenced-based HDS information to underserved inpatients and their physicians, in particular through health information technology. The research objectives of this application are: (1) to contribute to the knowledge base about HDS use among minority inpatients; (2) to design culturally sensitive literacy-informed patient-centered information technology systems to teach about HDS; and (3) to develop a patient safety curriculum that will help clinicians document HDS use and communicate effectively with their patients about HDS. To achieve these objectives, this K07 application has three specific aims: (1) Investigate the association between HDS use, health literacy, medication use, and hospital utilization in a sample of 750 hospitalized patients; (2) Conduct a randomized clinical trial in sixty women who will receive a hospitalized discharge plan on cranberry delivered by a virtual patient advocate (a computerized, animated, empathic character), and a control group who receives the same information via a cranberry patient information sheet; and (3) Design, program, and evaluate a web-based HDS patient safety curriculum for clinicians, then utilize pre and post measures and chart reviews to assess its impact on clinician-patient HDS communication. Completion of this research will be supported by: (1) a core of highly skilled mentors and consultants; and (2) completion of a Graduate Certificate in Instructional Technology at the Boston University School of Education. The candidate's career goals are to become (1) an independent HDS research investigator and educator for underserved populations, and (2) a national leader in the use of health information technology for HDS patient and clinician education. To prepare herself to accomplish these career goals, as well as the research objectives outlined above, the candidate proposes (1) to undertake mentored training in patient safety, health care disparities, health literacy, and epidemiologic methods, and (2) to pursue course-working clinical trial design, statistical analysis, human subject protections, and online curriculum development.

"Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: A model to improve primary care for Hispanics with diabetes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: An Intervention to Improve Nursing Care for Hispanics with Diabetes ABSTRACT Language barriers in healthcare are recognized as a leading determinant of health disparities among Hispanics in the United States.1 Limited English proficiency (LEP) has also been linked to the soaring diabetes epidemic among Hispanics. For Hispanics, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is 1.5 times that of non- Hispanic whites.3 Hispanic patients who do not speak English at home are at greater risk of foregoing diabetes care and they are significantly less likely than non-Hispanics to adopt a special diet for diabetes control, to exercise regularly, and to receive a yearly eye examination.6, 3 Recent research suggests that language concordance (LC) between patients and primary care providers is an effective precondition that improves outcomes in the treatment of LEP patients with diabetes. Interventions to increase the number of LC nurse practitioners consist of educational programs that develop second language (L2) abilities for health care professionals. A review of extant literature on L2 training for health professionals revealed that the preponderance of programs and materials are directed at basic levels of proficiency and confined to limited types of clinical interactions. The view of he present research team is that these programs and materials are substantially geared towards acute care and reflect a mismatch between an LEP patient population with chronic illnesses and a health professional workforce trained in L2 for acute care functions. This mismatch, we contend, exacerbates the difficulties faced by LEP patients with diabetes in achieving successful self- management and the physical and emotional wellness that goes along with it. This proposal describes the design and evaluation of an innovative educational intervention for nurse practitioner students called Integrated Language Learning for Chronic Care (IL2L). It pursues an integrated development of L2 and communication skills that will facilitate productive interactions between Spanish-speaking nurse practitioners and LEP Hispanic patients with diabetes. A mixed-method study design will be used to examine the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of the intervention. At the patient level, we will employ an RCT to determine the impact IL2L on the physical health, mental health, and self-efficacy of patients with uncontrolled diabetes. At the student level, we will employ the Roter Interaction Analysis System to measure gains in Spanish language interaction skills pre and post intervention. At the program level, we will use language program evaluation methodologies to assess the acceptability of the intervention within a nurse practitioner training program in a leading College of Nursing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: An Intervention to Improve Nursing Care for Hispanics with Diabetes PROJECT NARRATIVE Language barriers continues to impede access to quality care for limited English proficient populations.

"Estimating Hospital Outcome Quality: Applications to Pay-for-Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will pursue two major areas of research related to quality measurement and payment policy reform to improve value in healthcare. The first pertains to the evaluation and design of estimators of outcome quality and cost in order to profile the performance of healthcare providers. This research will evaluate the performance of existing estimators of outcome performance, propose new estimators, and validate the performance of these estimators to profile the quality, cost, and efficiency of hospitals and physician practices. The second area of research I will pursue is an evaluation of the Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) hospital-based pay-for-performance (P4P) program. I will test the effect of the P4P program on quality and cost for the areas incentivized in the program (maternity and newborn care, community acquired pneumonia, surgical infection prevention, pediatric asthma). I will also estimate the effect of the program on racial and ethnic disparities. To evaluate the performance of outcome measures, a simulation model will be constructed and a series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments will be designed and implemented. The basic approach is as follows: hypothetical providers are randomly assigned a ""true"" outcome score, a performance improvement trajectory, a patient risk score, a sample size, and a sample size trajectory. A random shock, inversely associated with sample size, is then created for each provider. Observed outcome scores, derived as a function of true outcome quality, patient risk, and the random shock are created for each hospital. Using only information on observed outcomes, true outcomes are then estimated using the candidate outcome estimators and the performance of these estimators is compared. The performance of these estimators will then be validated for hospitals and physicians using national Medicare data and data from Massachusetts. To evaluate the effect of the MassHealth program on quality, costs, and racial and ethnic disparities, I will draw on methods employed in my previous research. This will involve the use of panel data econometric techniques to test whether Massachusetts hospitals increased quality and decreased cost for MassHealth patients after the program was implemented. To examine the effect of the program on disparities, I will test for reductions in both within-hospital disparities in quality and between-hospital disparities in quality after the program was implemented. The skills and knowledge required to pursue my proposed research will be bolstered by an outstanding group of mentors and a robust education and career development plan. My mentors are leaders in the fields of payment and financing of healthcare, quality measurement, organizational research, health economics, and comparative effectiveness. Further, my mentors employ insights and perspectives from economics, political science, sociology, and clinical practice in their research, providing a rich and diverse intellectual environment from which I can draw upon as a mentee. In following my career development plan, I will enhance my methodological and programming skills, learn more about the responsible conduct of research, acquire knowledge of clinical practice and medical organization, and present my research findings and interact with colleagues at several national conferences. Research that successfully fulfills the aims of my K01 proposal will have important policy relevance. The proposed research will add to our knowledge about the use of outcome measures in pay-for-performance and public quality reporting while also providing further evidence about the effectiveness of pay-for- performance through the evaluation of the Massachusetts program. While ambitious, my track record of research achievement shows that I am capable of conducting research that achieves these aims. Further, the coursework and applied research conducted for the K01 will augment my research skills, enhancing my ability to achieve these aims. After collaborating with my mentors on this research, I will be have established myself as a researcher in the fields of P4P and quality measurement, positioning myself for R01 grants in these areas.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project has the potential to positively impact public health by creating more accurate estimators of healthcare provider outcome quality and cost and by contributing to the understanding of the effect of hospital-based pay-for-performance. This research can be used to design payment policy that creates stronger incentives for value and quality improvement in healthcare.

"An Analysis of the Impact of Linguistic and Paralinguistic Variables in Mediated    DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant):  Of the financial, structural, and personal barriers that limit access to healthcare, language is one of the most persistent. Despite this, empirical research delving into the complexities of mediated (interpreted) human interaction in healthcare settings is scarce, and many of the studies that do exist pose serious limitations when considered in the light of current linguistic theoretical frameworks. The influx of language-minority patients into the U.S. health system has led to a flurry of interest in the healthcare interpreter by medical researchers, with a number of studies in recent years being conducted to compare the performance of ad hoc interpreters to ""professional"" interpreters; to analyze misunderstanding and breakdown in communication caused by interpreters; and to develop approaches to testing the language proficiency and interpreting skills of healthcare interpreters. These studies have been carried out in isolation, with little input from the science of linguistics, in which studies in interaction have been conducted for decades. They fail to tease apart important variables related to the profile of the interpreter and provider, and to the interactional goals of particular communicative events in healthcare. The purpose of this research is to improve healthcare access provided to language minority patients (speakers of Spanish and ASL, in particular) by revealing some of the underlying obstacles (linguistic contributors) to healthcare patient-provider interaction. These contributors will be identified through qualitative and quantitative data collection approaches, including video recorded provider-patient encounters at a large hospital in south Texas. Demographics will also be collected on providers, patients, and interpreters and relationships between their profiles and linguistic contributors to miscommunication will be explored. This research is grounded in concepts derived from interactional sociolinguistics and conversation analysis.           Project Narrative Although language is discussed frequently in the literature as one of the major contributors to health disparities, empirical research delving into the complexities of mediated (interpreted) human interaction in healthcare settings is scarce. This study will explore and compare interpreted and non-interpreted interaction in healthcare settings, with a specific focus on breakdowns in communication. Qualitative and quantitative analyses will be conducted to identify linguistic contributors to miscommunication and their correlation with interpreter, provider, and patient profiles.

"The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality of treatment for cancer-associated complications, those complications directly attributable to the cancer itself or that result from chemotherapy and/or radiation, have received little attention. This is particularly problematic as cancer-associated complications are associated with significant morbidity, are often accompanied by pain and discomfort, and require the expenditure of substantial healthcare resources for treatment. The management of cancer-associated complications is compounded by the availability of a myriad of treatment options, many of which are unproven and associated with significant cost. Little is known about the factors that influence allocation of care for thes complications and what factors influence outcome. The health care a patient receives and its associated outcomes are influenced by the interplay of a number of patient, physician, and hospital factors. For acute inpatient medical conditions the characteristics of the hospital in which a patient is treated play a crucial role. There is growing recognition that there is widespread between-hospital variation in how care is allocated and that these differences in practice patterns explain a large portion of treatment variability. Uninsured and minority patients are particularly vulnerable to these hospital level disparities as these patients are disproportionately more likely to receive care at facilities with limited clinical and financial resources that may adversely affect quality. In this proposal we will determine the quality of treatment for hospitalized patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of: febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia of malignancy, esophagitis, and acute cancer-associated pain. For each cancer-associated complication we will determine patterns of treatment, the factors that underlie treatment decisions, and the effect of prompt initiation of guideline-based therapy on outcomes. For each condition we will first examine the utilization of guideline-based and non-indicated treatments. We will then comprehensively examine the influence of patient, physician, and hospital characteristics as well as between- hospital variations on the allocation of guideline-based care. We hypothesize that there is substantial variation in treatment between hospitals that is unexplained by traditional measures. Finally, we will perform novel causal inference and mediation analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects operating through a mediator of prompt guideline-based treatment on outcomes (length of stay, readmission, cost, non-routine discharge and mortality) for each complication. In addition to including a number of novel statistical methodologies, this proposal will utilize a unique database ideally suited to the study of these complications. The data from these studies will lead to immediately actionable results that can be used to guide the implementation pragmatic hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To date, the complications that result either directly from cancer or from its treatment have received almost no attention. Our findings will provide important data on the management of these complications to patients, providers, and payers that are immediately actionable and can guide the development of targeted hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications.                ",The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp,8601054,R01CA169121,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Expenditure ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neutropenia ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Consensus ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' novel ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Treatment-Associated Cancer ', ' Therapy-Related Cancer ', ' Therapy-Associated Cancers ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Tumor ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Iatrogenic Cancer ', ' Treatment-Related Cancer ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' chemotherapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' common treatment ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,322040,-0.01548694870834524
"Bridges to the Bacclaureate Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) partnership between the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing (NHWSN) at Emory University and the Nursing Program at Georgia Perimeter College (GPC). The program focuses on identifying students from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups - groups who are underrepresented in nursing and nursing science as well - and supporting them through the associate degree to the baccalaureate in nursing (BSN) and on to careers in nursing science in the PhD program in Nursing at Emory or at similar research-intensive institutions. BttB aims to increase the number of underrepresented students who complete the AS degree in Nursing at GPC and enter the BSN program at NHWSN; who develop skills and knowledge in nursing science; and who are socialized into the culture and profession of nursing science and move forward to doctoral studies. BttB responds to national needs to address the nursing shortage by developing a next generation of nursing scientists to be faculty in schools of nursing who both teach and create the evidence for improved practice. It also addresses the IOM call for nursing leadership to work with other professions to develop innovative solutions to the nation's health care crisis and to the persistent problem of health disparities. The BttB program will consist of five elements; (1) recruitment and enrollment; (2) research exposure; (3) research immersion; (4) academic programming; and (5) mentoring, advising, and counseling. Faculty from both institutions will participate in selecting GPC students into the BttB program in their first semester in the GPC nursing program. Research roundtables and summer and school-year research immersion experiences will strengthen the environment of research at GPC and will enable students to learn about nursing science both conceptually and experientially. The roundtable and immersion experiences will continue when students transfer to NHWSN and enter an RN-BSN program that is specifically tailored to accommodate their prior training and to further immerse them in nursing science. At NHWSN, BttB students will be in an environment characterized by the active conduct of funded research by a large number of tenured and tenure track faculty.

"Using Quality Improvement to Benchmark and Reduce Disparities in Surgical Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Institute of Medicine defines the six pillars of 'quality' in health care as 'safe, effective, patient- centered, timely, efficient, and equitable'.In an effort to improve the delivery of health care nationwide, provider organizations have mounted numerous Quality Improvement initiatives. However, the achievement of equity remains a challenge as numerous reports document the persistence of disparities despite a wave of Quality Improvement programs. In this context, the delivery of surgical care is under the microscope at multiple levels and the measurement of surgical outcomes is becoming routine. While metrics to compare provider performance in other categories of 'quality' exist, there is currently no standardized method of benchmarking equity in surgical care. This is true despite extensive literature documenting disparate outcomes in surgical care in AHRQ priority populations such as racial and ethnic minorities. Our project addresses this critical barrier in tw critical steps: (1) demonstrating the feasibility of benchmarking racial and ethnic disparities in surgical care by developing and publishing an innovative methodology to capture nationwide variation in racial and ethnic disparities for three surgical procedures by hospital provider, and (2) characterizing hospital attributes that correlate with equitable performance. This project confirms the hypothesis that disparities in surgical care are not uniform across all providers. Our preliminary data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample reveal performance variation by hospital in the Observed likelihood of providing surgical procedures for racial and ethnic minority patients (i.e. Blacks, Hispanics) when compared to a risk-adjusted Expected likelihood of the same for nonminority White patients. This fundamentally challenges the popular paradigm that racial and ethnic disparities in surgery result primarily from patient factors such as socioeconomic status, insurance status, comorbidities, or even the genetics of race itself. In accordance with the AHRQ mission ""to enhance the quality of health care services for all Americans"", this project introduces a novel measurement tool for policy-makers and providers to benchmark disparities in surgical care and enables the deployment of Quality Improvement tools towards achieving equity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In accordance with the AHRQ mission to enhance the quality of health care services for all Americans, we propose a methodology to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in surgical care. Despite extensive documentation of disparities in surgery, organizations monitoring quality in surgical care do not currently report disparities to providers.

"Racial disparities in hospital use and quality of care for coronary heart disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research suggests that racial disparities in heart disease treatment are due in part to differences in the quality of hospitals used by white and black patients. One possible explanation is that blacks live in neighborhoods with worse hospitals. However, recent studies have found that blacks are also more likely than whites to travel beyond reputable, high quality hospitals, especially for non-urgent specialized treatments, even when they live close to these facilities. Thus, factors other than location may play a role in how blacks and whites use high and low quality hospitals. We assume that, even after accounting for location, black patients are more likely to use lower quality hospital and hospitals that are located in majority black neighborhoods or have a sizable black clientele. This may be the consequence of differences in physician referrals or patient distrust of predominantly white institutions, and is likely to result in higher rates of bypass of high-quality hospitals among blacks. We further assume that the racial differences in how blacks and whites use high and low quality hospitals are more pronounced in metro areas with high residential segregation and in neighborhoods with high social disadvantage. The proposed research will focus on three cardiac conditions with various degrees of acuity - acute myocardial infarction, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery - and will use several national data sources, including Medicare files to identify patients and hospitals they use; American Hospital Association surveys for hospital characteristics; and the US Census to obtain zip code and metro area demographics and segregation measures. Analyses will employ state-of-the-art methods developed specifically for the study of hospital choice. The study will enhance our understanding of causal pathways in health care disparities by answering important questions related to factors contributing to racial differences in hospital care for the treatment of heart disease. Does geography play a role in black and white seniors' access to high quality hospitals? Is a hospital's neighborhood racial composition particularly salient to black seniors? Are these effects modified by the degree of metro area residential segregation? What is the contribution of differences in geographic access, and of differences in how black and white seniors choose hospitals, to the segregation of health care quality? The proposed study will address these and many more questions. Further, by quantifying the relative roles of geography and hospital choice behavior, the study will provide valuable information to local policy makers aiming to reduce disparities in their respective metro areas.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will evaluate the role of geographic and social context factors in how black and white seniors choose hospitals for the treatment of heart disease. The study is relevant to public health and policy makers by 1) identifying areas with poor geographic access to high-quality hospitals that could be targeted for quality improvement; and 2) enhancing our understanding of how hospital, neighborhood, and metro area factors affect the use of high and low quality hospitals and, more generally, the segregation of health care delivery. Enhanced understanding will enable us to design completely new interventions targeted at, for example, improving relationships and trust between communities and health care institutions.            ",Racial disparities in hospital use and quality of care for coronary heart disease,8629501,R01HL118410,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Communities ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hospitals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' reperfusion ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Travel ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' intraluminal angioplasty ', ' Angioplasty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' Bypass ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2014,387255,0.029025340768713274
"Effect of Emergency Care Availability on Racial Disparities in Access & Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial differences in the burden of cardiovascular disease contribute significantly to health disparities observed in the United States. Timely access to emergency care is critical for diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF), yet access to emergency departments (EDs) varies substantially across communities. The deterioration of ED access, due to either ED closure or crowding (henceforth ""ED access block""), is associated with increased mortality rates. It has been posited that ED closures may improve acute care by removing poor-performers in a competitive market such that there is a tradeoff between distance traveled and quality of care. The risk of this assumption however, is that if ED closures occur mainly in minority communities, there could be differential effects on minority communities. We seek to fill this gap in the literature. Our long-term goal is to identify system-level mechanisms in emergency care delivery that contribute to disparities across various segments of the population. Our objectives are (1) to identify whether ED access block is a possible contributor to the widening of process and health outcome disparities between black and white patients with CHF and AMI; and (2) whether improved access (as a result of ED openings) may reduce disparities. We will link Medicare claims, hospital surveys, location data, and daily ambulance diversion logs from 2001 to 2010 to address the following Specific Aims (sample size is ~6 million admissions): Aim 1: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority patients relative to others within a community and whether ED openings can reduce those disparities. We hypothesize that ED access block results in a higher percentage of black patients being admitted to facilities with lower level technology, receiving inferior treatment, and experiencing worse patient outcomes as compared to white patients. Aim 2: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority-serving hospitals and whether ED openings can reduce disparities. We hypothesize that minority-serving hospitals are disproportionately burdened with a higher patient load and experience deteriorating quality relative to other facilities with the same level of ED access block. Aim 3: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority-heavy communities and whether ED openings can reduce disparities. We hypothesize that minority-heavy communities experience reduced technology access and quality relative to others when exposed to ED access block. Achieving these aims will offer an unusually complete picture of the potential mechanisms through which disparities can occur at patient-, facility-, and community-levels. Such mechanisms will inform policy makers whether certain measures are needed to improve efficiency of care and minimize disparities. Our framework can be applied broadly to investigate other types of disparities where ED access is critical.          The objective of the research is to determine whether emergency department closures or crowding widens racial disparities in access and outcomes at patient-, facility-, and community-levels; and whether improved access as a result of ED opening can reduce such disparities. Health policies aiming to improve efficiency of care delivery can have unintended consequences of widening health disparities. Our results will offer an unusually complete picture of the potential mechanisms through which disparities can occur at different levels of care delivery, as well as inform policies with specific measures that may be applied to minimize disparities.

"Understanding Disparities in Patient-Centered Hospital Care  Project Abstract Understanding the underlying causes of health disparities and developing effective methods to promote equitable health outcomes is a critical health policy goal. While we have substantial data showing large gaps in care between minority and non-minority patients, we have made little progress in eliminating these gaps. Previous studies indicate that optimal patient experiences with care may improve health outcomes and health status, and that minority patients report worse experiences with outpatient care than white patients. Yet, we have limited data on potential racial and ethnic disparities in patients' experiences in the hospital setting and factors that might explain these gaps. New national policy efforts, which aim to reward or penalize hospitals based on their performance on metrics of patient experience, create a need to understand whether hospitals that disproportionately care for minorities have worse performance and how we might intervene. Our work will examine both patient and hospital-level factors to better understand within and between hospital differences in patients' experiences and provide critically important data for interventions to promote equitable care. We propose to use patient-level data on patient experiences with hospital care from the HCAHPS database to examine four aims. We begin by examining whether there are racial or ethnic differences in care overall. We then examine the degree to which disparities in experience are due to ""within"" hospital differences, ""between"" hospital differences, or both. Our second aim will be to examine factors that explain or modify disparities within hospitals. Third, we will examine if the proportion of minority patients in a hospital is associated with hospital performance on patient experience metrics, and whether leadership's commitment to patient experience, financial health, and nurse staffing levels explain the relationship between proportion of minorities and patient experience. Finally, we will determine the role of these factors in improving patient experience over time. Our work will paint a national portrait of experiences of black, Hispanic, and white Americans in U.S. hospitals and provide timely data to ensure that national policies to improve care do not worsen disparities. We will quantify the degree to which disparities exist and whether they affect certain subgroups more than others. For example, if disparities in experience are most pronounced among the elderly or among hospitals with a large proportion of minority patients, these findings will provide targets for interventions. The analysis on institutional mediators should provide useful guidance about what interventions will most effectively reduce disparities in patient experience. Finally, our longitudinal analysis on how minority-serving hospitals improve over time will provide key insights about where to place future efforts to promote equitable, patient-centered care among all Americans.  Project Narrative Ensuring optimal patient experience, a centerpiece of delivering high quality care, is now an integral part of a major national policy effort to reward hospitals based on performance. Unfortunately, we lack empirical data to help policymakers and clinical leaders improve minorities' experiences and ensure equitable delivery of care. Our study, which aims to determine whether racial and ethnic minorities have worse experiences with hospital care than non-minorities and whether key factors explain racial and ethnic differences in patient experience, will provide important and actionable information to ensure that national policy efforts to improve hospital care promote equity as well as quality.",Understanding Disparities in Patient-Centered Hospital Care,8600631,R01MD006230,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Hospitals ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' Paint ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' payment ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Portraits ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' policy implication ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NIMHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2014,408247,0.06713720039884395
"User-driven Tool for Bilingual Clinical Dialogs and Medical Language Acquisition  PROJECT SUMMARY Persistent disparities in healthcare access hinder the nation's 26 million individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) from receiving quality care and, as a result, from achieving optimal health outcomes. Patients who struggle to understand their care providers report difficulty navigating both administrative and clinical procedures and experience significantly higher rates of delays in care delivery and poorer outcomes than their English-proficient counterparts. Despite numerous federal and state-level mandates for increased language assistance services, healthcare organizations have had limited success in tackling these challenges posed by the language barrier. This project aims to bring much-needed innovation to alleviate communication obstacles and accompanying health disparities. The envisioned solution will offer both in-clinic communication support and user-driven medical language skills acquisition training that can be accessed on desktop computers, touchscreen tablets, and mobile devices. The resultant system will leverage the medical provider community to identify actual in-clinic communication needs, which will drive the development of targeted learning materials that are relevant to the intended users. The medical interpreter community, a highly valuable but underutilized resource, will be leveraged to aid providers in their efforts to acquire second-language proficiency as well as provide on-demand live interpretations services through a streamlined method of connection on the envisioned product. The system will be evaluated by LEP patients, front-line healthcare providers, and certified medical interpreters to assess its ability to improve provider-patient communication and, in so doing, meaningfully contribute to addressing the health disparities facing these underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapidly growing population of persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) has profound implications for the healthcare system, as the miscommunications experienced by these individuals in clinical settings result in compromised care, and poses a greater financial burden on the hospitals that serve them compared to their English proficient counterparts. Directives from all levels of government to provide language assistance services to these underserved patients remain inadequately implemented, and the marketplace has similarly failed to provide practical and compelling solutions. In response to these challenges, this project will develop a comprehensive medical language assistance system that will both deliver engaging language skills acquisition training to providers and facilitate bilingual clinical dialog with their LEP patients, providing a much-needed solution with the potential to fill the void of effective medical communication tools and elevate the quality of care for a large segment of underserved patients.            ",User-driven Tool for Bilingual Clinical Dialogs and Medical Language Acquisition,8647884,R44MD008672,"['Aptitude ', ' Boston ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crowding ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Solutions ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' phrases ', ' skills ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' skill acquisition ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,"TRANSCENDENT INTERNATIONAL, LLC",R44,2014,210185,0.04871148621765367
"RISE Program Option I: University of Puerto Rico at Cayey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The RISE program continues to transform the academic environment at UPR-Cayey by focusing on the preparation of students to become scientists. As part of this long term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in four areas, 1- their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, 2- their limited research skills and experience, 3- limited quantitative and qualitative skills, and 4- limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, five developmental activities are prescribed- visiting scientists, research skills, discovery chemistry, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting alumni scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. RISE students will take Discovery Chemistry to quantitative and qualitative skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 60 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the USA. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: 1) research and language skills with faculty mentors; 2) motivational visiting alumni scientists; 3) inquiry methodology by chemistry faculty and 4) research lab experience with either on- island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the USA. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPRC alumni who will be biomedical research scientists. During the last 5 years (2005-09), 32 RISE alumni completed Ph.D.s from major research universities; a 100% increase over the previous five-year period. By doubling the number of Ph.D. alumni, RISE will impact the community.

"A Data-driven Approach to Improve Nursing Workflow and Patient-centered Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care recognizes patients' desires, opinions, and preferences as equal in importance to those of healthcare professionals, and emphasizes the need to educate and empower patients to play an active role in their care. The achievement of patient-centered care is associated with increased patient and provider satisfaction, improved health outcomes, and reduced cost of care delivery (Caffarini, 2011; Silow-Carol et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2008). Furthermore, as health disparities continue to persist, patient-centered care offers underserved patients the individualized and tailored care necessary to attain positive health outcomes. As the providers who spend more time with patients than any other personnel, nursing staff are central to the provision of patient-centered care (De Lucia et al., 2009). However, most of these front-line providers are burdened by numerous non-value added tasks that not only distract from direct patient care activities, but also hamper their ability to implement best practices such as proven care plans for preventing adverse events (e.g., falls and pressure ulcers) among at-risk patients (Hendrich et al., 2008; Storfjell et al., 2008; Aiken et al., 2002). The occurrence of such preventable events is especially concerning in light of the fact that such events fall disproportionately on already underserved populations, including certain racial/ethnic communities, limited English speaking individuals, and the elderly (Divi et al., 2007; Metersky et al., 2011; Rothschild et al., 2000). Fr patient-centered care to be truly realized, the healthcare system must introduce process innovations that can streamline mundane, indirect tasks such as service documentation for front-line nursing care providers and enable them to efficiently adopt value added clinical practices that benefit direct patient care activities. In this project, we will engage several partners-including a skilled nursing facility that serves predominantly monolingual Spanish- and Chinese-speaking communities and a long-term care facility for retired veterans-to implement an advanced patient-nurse communication and nurse workflow optimization system. This solution will: (i) track comprehensive care plans and associated tasks for individual patients; (ii intelligently assign and alert each provider of his or her care plan tasks, escalating pending tasks to appropriate staff members to expedite completion; and (iii) offer real-time analysis of task fulfillment status and workflow patterns, providing decision support to both staff and managers for identifying factors that may undermine staff productivity or contribute to adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patient-centered care is associated with increased quality and satisfaction with health services, and has significant potential to improve health outcomes for communities that experience health disparities; however, numerous indirect and often burdensome tasks hinder most nurses from delivering truly patient-centered care. To increase time available for direct bedside patient interactions, this project will develop a patient-nurse communication and workflow optimization tool specifically for streamlining nursing care protocols. By offering nurses full visibility of their workload, efficient interactive checklists fr carrying out upcoming tasks, and low- burden documentation capabilities from virtually any location in the unit, this innovative system will empower nurses to reduce time spent on low-value, indirect care tasks and be better able to account for individual patients' communication needs, thereby transforming the care environment to support patient-centered care delivery and sustained improvement in patient outcomes.",A Data-driven Approach to Improve Nursing Workflow and Patient-centered Care,8740097,R44MD009581,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Video Display Terminals ', ' Computer Terminals ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

More recent data suggest that the number of minority nursing homes residents is increasing dramatically, while the number of white residents is declining. These new demographic changes raise concerns about whether nursing homes are able to serve appropriately the needs of patients with increasingly diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The quality of care delivered in nursing homes has been a longstanding issue plaguing the industry, and continues to be the focus of federal and state policies aimed at improving it. Extant evidence suggests that these policies, including strengthened state quality regulations, improved Medicaid reimbursements, and more recent efforts to foster market competition (e.g., the repeal of the Certificate of Need requirement; the national quality reporting), have improved nursing home quality and outcomes during the past decade. As the industry makes headway and improves quality in response to these policy and market trends, it is important to recognize that improvements in overall nursing home quality may not automatically benefit all subgroups of patients equally. Indeed, despite evidence of overall improvements, a large body of literature continues to document racial/ethnic disparities in nursing home quality. In particular, our recent work, published in the Journal of American Medical Association, has for the first time provided evidence that while pressure ulcer outcomes in nursing homes have improved for both non-Hispanic whites and minorities, the gap between these two groups of patients remained unchanged. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to answer two very important questions: 1) Does this phenomenon, of improvement in quality for all concomitant with a persistent gap between racial/ethnic groups, exist in other areas of known disparities for nursing home care? and 2) Can we identify specific policy and market characteristics that have been successful not only in improving quality but also in closing the racial and ethnic gap in quality? The proposed project will achieve these goals by investigating the longitudinal and cross sectional impact of each of three major types of nursing home quality drivers - state regulation of quality, Medicaid reimbursement, and market competition - on the racial/ethnic quality gap and its persistence. The information generated by this project will contribute to the knowledge regarding the ways with which major nursing home policies impact equity of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The proposed project will investigate the longitudinal and cross sectional impact of each of three major types of nursing home quality drivers - state regulation of quality, Medicaid reimbursement, and market competition - on the racial/ethnic quality gap and its persistence.                ",Impacts of nursing home competition & state policies on disparities in quality,8695480,R01MD007662,"['abstracting ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Certificate of Need ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Industry ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Patients ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Publishing ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2014,388188,0.07514040581430492
"Improving Nursing Home Compare to Meet the Needs of Minority Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elders and potential users of nursing home public report cards do not have uniform care needs or information preferences. Yet little is known about how information use, needs, and preferences vary across population groups. Further, no nursing home report cards present performance measures stratified by race/ethnicity. The goals of this study are to identify ways in which Nursing Home Compare (NHC) can be improved to better meet the needs and preferences of minority populations and to test NHC measure stratification by race/ethnicity. To this end, this study seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1 Collect feedback from minority elders, caregivers, and other stakeholders on their opinions of NHC and about how the report cards might be changed to better suit their needs and priorities; 2. Use existing data to create NHC performance measures stratified by population group and a set of related disparities measures and determine the statistical relevance and feasibility of such measures; 3. Determine whether different population members find measure stratification and disparities measures useful in seeking nursing home care. This study will focus on the nursing home public reporting needs and preferences of African American/black elders and Hispanic/Latino elders. Initial consumer feedback on needs and preferences will be collected through focus groups and interviews with elders and family members of these groups, in addition to non-Hispanic white elders and family members and discharge planners. Data from the Minimum Data Set regarding resident characteristics and outcomes will be used to create several forms of NHC performance indicators, stratified by population group, and a set of related disparities measures. Statistical testing and trends analysis will be conducted to ascertain the relevance and feasibility of stratifying measures. Finally, these measures will be presented to the different population group members to collect data on their opinions of the usefulness and value of such measures.          Makers of private and public report cards can use the findings from this study to understand how information needs and preferences vary by race/ethnicity and to inform efforts to increase report card use among these groups. Policymakers and nursing home administrators can use the findings to understand the extent to which care varies by population group within facilities. Findings will also provide insight into the statistical feasibiity of using stratified and disparities measures in nursing home public reporting, as well as consumers' perceived value such information has in making nursing home decisions.

"Identifying Ways to Reduce Readmissions Among Minority-Serving U.S. Hospitals     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia are three of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the Medicare program, and each is associated with high 30-day readmission rates. Although readmissions are common across all patient groups, black patients are more likely than white patients to be readmitted for reasons that are not well understood. The site of care likely plays an important role: care for minorities is concentrated among a small number of minority-serving hospitals (MSHs), which provide a lower quality of care and have worse outcomes, including higher readmission rates. However, even among MSHs, there are large variations: in preliminary analyses, we found three-fold variations in readmission rates (e.g. for AMI, 12.2% in the best versus 35.7% in the worst quartile) with some MSHs achieving results comparable to the best hospitals nationally. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made reducing readmissions a priority by requiring that Medicare lower payments to hospitals with high readmission rates and in preliminary analyses for this proposal, we found that MSHs have nearly three times greater odds of being in the worst quartile of performance nationally. If these hospitals fail to improve, the new policy is likely to worsen existing disparities in care. However, we know little about why some MSHs have low readmission rates while others lag behind. Helping MSHs reduce readmissions is critically important, but we lack the empirical data to make evidence-based recommendations. We propose to examine key patient-, hospital-, and market-level factors that explain the large variations in readmission among MSHs, and determine if the presence of these factors explains gaps in performance between MSHs and non-MSHs. We will use case studies to characterize readmission prevention practices at MSHs with the highest and lowest risk-adjusted readmission rates. We will then use a national survey of hospital Chief Medical Officers to create the first national picture of current knowledge, priorities, and programs around readmissions. Finally, we will use administrative databases to examine the degree to which these factors explain variations in readmissions among MSHs, whether the important factors we identify also explain variation at non-MSHs, and whether they explain disparities between non-MSHs and MSHs. Understanding the substantial variations in readmission rates among MSHs will allow us to identify key factors that are actionable and relevant to MSHs. These data will help policymakers craft effective and novel interventions help MSHs improve care for all their patients, thus reducing disparities in readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia are three of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the Medicare program, and each is associated with high 30-day readmission rates. Black patients have higher readmission rates than white patients for these conditions, and much of this difference is driven by site of care: minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) have higher rates of readmissions than non-MSHs. Even within MSHs, there are nearly three-fold differences in readmission rates, suggesting there are ample opportunities to improve. Our study will use a mixed-methods approach, including case studies, a national survey of hospital Chief Medical Officers, and multilevel modeling with Medicare data, to understand patient-, hospital-, and market-level factors that impact rates of readmissions at MSHs, with the goal of identifying actionable factors that could help policymakers craft effective policies to improve care among these providers and reduce racial disparities in this important health outcome.            ",Identifying Ways to Reduce Readmissions Among Minority-Serving U.S. Hospitals,8644879,R01HL113567,"['Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Leadership ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Prevention ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2014,394850,0.0290755544839599
"Hispanic Role Models in Health Care Careers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers:  Empowering Hispanic Nurses to Leverage Traditional Spanish language and New Social Media to Inspire the Next Generation of Culturally Diverse  and Competent Health Care Professionals The National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN), in association with the Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), proposes to address the shortage of bilingual professionals in all health fields by recruiting and interviewing bilingual role models and arranging to broadcast those interviews nationwide. Leveraging HCN's nationally broadcast health education radio shows, whose cumulative audiences are larger than NPR's ""All Things Considered,"" this project has the potential to reach one out of every three US Hispanics during its first five years. This media campaign is intended to inspire Hispanic parents to encourage their children to study science and aspire to careers in the biomedical professions. It is also intended to inspire and empower Spanish-speaking adults from all walks of life to consider careers in the health professions. All broadcasts will tie to NAHN's interactive website so that students and adults interested in changing careers can find mentors and educational resources.         NAHN will also use YouTube, Facebook, mobile phone applications, and other new and popular social media technologies to reach a broad cross-section of English speaking youth and young adults.         In addition to the national media outputs, attendees at NAHN's annual conferences will have the opportunity to receive training in public speaking and media relations so they can more effectively use local media in their own communities to address health disparities and promote careers in the biomedical and health professions.         NAHN will develop a standardized, bilingual Toolkit for public presentations. The Toolkit will include a Powerpoint presentation embedded with video containing gender- and other- stereotype-busting role model interviews with Hispanic nurses; links to an online database of volunteer mentors; and a bilingual terminology packet that will aid nurses in creating linguistic and cognitive bridges between audience and professional knowledge bases. We expect that the refined Toolkit will empower nurses and other health professionals to become more effective public health educators and career role models during their presentations at community health events, career fairs, achievement clubs, and school assemblies.        An Advisory Committee of other health organizations, professionals, and advocates will recommend Role Models and provide periodic feedback.         Bilingual independent evaluators associated with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health will conduct qualitative and quantitative formative, iterative, and summative evaluations throughout the project. Their recommendations and findings will be incorporated into the project design and deliverables and shared with relevant fields.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers, a collaboration of the National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN) and Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), addresses the need for cultural and linguistic diversity among health professionals. HCN will broadcast interviews of Role Models on its 250 affiliated Spanish-language popular radio stations nationwide to inform Spanish-speakers about the range of health careers open to them with proper education and to inspire them to imagine themselves as successful professionals. This effort will be combined with the creation of a number of bilingual online resources for health career aspirants, including an extensive database of volunteer professionals who have said ""Si!Sere Mentor!"" (""Yes! I will mentor you!""), which will provide Hispanics of all ages and walks of life with the opportunity to form relationships with seasoned professionals.            ",Hispanic Role Models in Health

"User-driven Tool for Bilingual Clinical Dialogs and Medical Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent disparities in healthcare access hinder the nation's 26 million individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) from receiving quality care and, as a result, from achieving optimal health outcomes. Patients who struggle to understand their care providers report difficulty navigating both administrative and clinical procedures and experience significantly higher rates of delays in care delivery and poorer outcomes than their English-proficient counterparts. Despite numerous federal and state-level mandates for increased language assistance services, healthcare organizations have had limited success in tackling these challenges posed by the language barrier. This project aims to bring much-needed innovation to alleviate communication obstacles and accompanying health disparities. The envisioned solution will offer both in-clinic communication support and user-driven medical language skills acquisition training that can be accessed on desktop computers, touchscreen tablets, and mobile devices. The resultant system will leverage the medical provider community to identify actual in-clinic communication needs, which will drive the development of targeted learning materials that are relevant to the intended users. The medical interpreter community, a highly valuable but underutilized resource, will be leveraged to aid providers in their efforts to acquire second-language proficiency as well as provide on-demand live interpretations services through a streamlined method of connection on the envisioned product. The system will be evaluated by LEP patients, front-line healthcare providers, and certified medical interpreters to assess its ability to improve provider-patient communication and, in so doing, meaningfully contribute to addressing the health disparities facing these underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapidly growing population of persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) has profound implications for the healthcare system, as the miscommunications experienced by these individuals in clinical settings result in compromised care, and poses a greater financial burden on the hospitals that serve them compared to their English proficient counterparts. Directives from all levels of government to provide language assistance services to these underserved patients remain inadequately implemented, and the marketplace has similarly failed to provide practical and compelling solutions. In response to these challenges, this project will develop a comprehensive medical language assistance system that will both deliver engaging language skills acquisition training to providers and facilitate bilingual clinical dialog with their LEP patients, providing a much-needed solution with the potential to fill the void of effective medical communication tools and elevate the quality of care for a large segment of underserved patients.",User-driven Tool for Bilingual Clinical Dialogs and Medical Language Acquisition,8895154,R44MD008672,"['Aptitude ', ' Boston ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crowding ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Solutions ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' phrases ', ' skills ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' skill acquisition ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' prototype ', ' ']",NIMHD,"TRANSCENDENT INTERNATIONAL, LLC",R44,2014,750018,0.04901250320443535
"Estimating Hospital Outcome Quality: Applications to Pay-for-Performance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will pursue two major areas of research related to quality measurement and payment policy reform to improve value in healthcare. The first pertains to the evaluation and design of estimators of outcome quality and cost in order to profile the performance of healthcare providers. This research will evaluate the performance of existing estimators of outcome performance, propose new estimators, and validate the performance of these estimators to profile the quality, cost, and efficiency of hospitals and physician practices. The second area of research I will pursue is an evaluation of the Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) hospital-based pay-for-performance (P4P) program. I will test the effect of the P4P program on quality and cost for the areas incentivized in the program (maternity and newborn care, community acquired pneumonia, surgical infection prevention, pediatric asthma). I will also estimate the effect of the program on racial and ethnic disparities. To evaluate the performance of outcome measures, a simulation model will be constructed and a series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments will be designed and implemented. The basic approach is as follows: hypothetical providers are randomly assigned a ""true"" outcome score, a performance improvement trajectory, a patient risk score, a sample size, and a sample size trajectory. A random shock, inversely associated with sample size, is then created for each provider. Observed outcome scores, derived as a function of true outcome quality, patient risk, and the random shock are created for each hospital. Using only information on observed outcomes, true outcomes are then estimated using the candidate outcome estimators and the performance of these estimators is compared. The performance of these estimators will then be validated for hospitals and physicians using national Medicare data and data from Massachusetts. To evaluate the effect of the MassHealth program on quality, costs, and racial and ethnic disparities, I will draw on methods employed in my previous research. This will involve the use of panel data econometric techniques to test whether Massachusetts hospitals increased quality and decreased cost for MassHealth patients after the program was implemented. To examine the effect of the program on disparities, I will test for reductions in both within-hospital disparities in quality and between-hospital disparities in quality after the program was implemented. The skills and knowledge required to pursue my proposed research will be bolstered by an outstanding group of mentors and a robust education and career development plan. My mentors are leaders in the fields of payment and financing of healthcare, quality measurement, organizational research, health economics, and comparative effectiveness. Further, my mentors employ insights and perspectives from economics, political science, sociology, and clinical practice in their research, providing a rich and diverse intellectual environment from which I can draw upon as a mentee. In following my career development plan, I will enhance my methodological and programming skills, learn more about the responsible conduct of research, acquire knowledge of clinical practice and medical organization, and present my research findings and interact with colleagues at several national conferences. Research that successfully fulfills the aims of my K01 proposal will have important policy relevance. The proposed research will add to our knowledge about the use of outcome measures in pay-for-performance and public quality reporting while also providing further evidence about the effectiveness of pay-for- performance through the evaluation of the Massachusetts program. While ambitious, my track record of research achievement shows that I am capable of conducting research that achieves these aims. Further, the coursework and applied research conducted for the K01 will augment my research skills, enhancing my ability to achieve these aims. After collaborating with my mentors on this research, I will be have established myself as a researcher in the fields of P4P and quality measurement, positioning myself for R01 grants in these areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project has the potential to positively impact public health by creating more accurate estimators of healthcare provider outcome quality and cost and by contributing to the understanding of the effect of hospital-based pay-for-performance. This research can be used to design payment policy that creates stronger incentives for value and quality improvement in healthcare.",Estimating Hospital Outcome Quality: Applications to Pay-for-Performance,8960377,K01HS018546,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2014,130848,0.014001445921557666
"The Impact of Cardiac Care Regionalization on Access, Treatment, and Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is the leading cause of death in the United States. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a common and particularly severe form of AMI for which timely access to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is essential to good patient outcomes. In an attempt to improve outcomes for STEMI patients, STEMI regionalization systems have been established at the local and state level across the United States to quickly route or transfer STEMI patients to a hospital with PCI capability. However, no studies of this relatively new healthcare system have been able to show if, and how, regionalization has improved access and mortality at the community level, as prior work has been limited by studies done in single-hospital settings, the evaluation of only certain process outcomes, and the lack of inclusion of a control group to account for secular trends in improved mortality.  Our goals in this proposal are 3-fold: (1) to determine to what extent regionalized STEMI systems are associated with improvements in both access and outcomes, (2) whether vulnerable communities benefit equally within the same system, and (3) how distance and time differentially affect these outcomes. To accomplish these goals, we propose an innovative and definitive approach to study California, a state that provides a natural experiment of STEMI regionalization, as 59% of its counties have regionalized at different times over the study period. We will use a difference-in-differences approach and link non-public patient discharge data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development between 2006-2011 (H182,800 STEMI patients) with a database designed by the PI of the regionalization status of each county over the same period. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which overall access (defined by admission to PCI-capable hospital), treatment (receipt of PCI), and health outcomes differ for STEMI patients in regionalized vs. non-regionalized communities. We hypothesize that the change in probability of being admitted to a PCI- equipped hospital and of receiving PCI will be appreciably higher in counties experiencing regionalization than non-regionalized counties and that health outcomes will improve. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes have changed for STEMI patients in regionalized vs. non- regionalized communities. We hypothesize that STEMI patients who belong to traditionally underserved populations will have larger improvements in these metrics post-regionalization relative to the reference population. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which changes in access, treatment, and outcome differ for STEMI patients according to distance and time horizon following regionalization. We hypothesize that STEMI patients living farther away from regional PCI centers will benefit differentially more than those living closer to regional PCI centers and benefits of regionalization may not be seen until 1-2 years post- implementation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinicians and policymakers face decisions about whether to fundamentally restructure care networks in order to improve care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). These changes are often expensive, require massive organizational changes, and could have unintended adverse consequences. This project will inform future regionalization efforts on other health issues currently being debated and have collateral benefits on the approach to other organizational changes and their evaluation by creating a template for future efforts.","The Impact of Cardiac Care Regionalization on Access, Treatment, and Outcomes",8903509,R56HL121108,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Masks ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Veins ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Process Measure ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' Route ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' database design ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' patient population ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R56,2014,409660,0.021093686821439396
"Hospital Quality Reports for Expectant Mothers: Considering Race and Language     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited English proficiency (LEP) and race/ethnicity have not been well studied in consumer reporting of hospital quality, though these factors present barriers to quality health care. Public quality reports are also underused among minority and LEP groups. The science of consumer reporting is missing core knowledge of how individuals from diverse racial/ethnic groups, including those with LEP, use hospital quality measures, what they value and understand from existing quality reports, and whether additional information or presentation features might encourage higher use. The field is also missing personalized, relevant, easy-to- understand quality reporting templates designed for distinct cultural groups and/or non-English language speakers. These issues are particularly relevant for many Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) subgroups that have distinct cultural preferences, health disparities, and high proportions of LEP. Childbirth, the most common reason women are hospitalized in the U.S., is a particularly expensive area of the health care system with known health outcome disparities and quality concerns. Pregnant women are likely to be particularly activated consumers with strong interest in hospital quality and sufficient advance notice about the upcoming hospitalization to research the topic. Improving the use of public hospital quality reports for pregnant women across diverse racial/ethnic and LEP groups could help drive overall quality improvement in childbirth and reduce maternal health outcome disparities. In order to address key knowledge gaps in the science of public reporting and to meet quality improvement and disparity reduction goals, we will: (1): Quantify inpatient maternal health quality outcomes and childbirth hospitalization patterns among diverse AA/PI and LEP populations in Hawaii to strengthen empirical evidence on this understudied topic, to determine relevant populations for Aims 2-3, and to provide group-specific results for personalized maternal inpatient quality metrics in Aim 3; (2): Describe utilization, usefulness, ease-of-use, and preferences for public reports of inpatient maternal health quality across diverse AA/PI and LEP groups by interviewing 400 women with a recent hospital delivery. Findings will be contextualized within the constraints, decision inputs, and factors relevant to the childbirth hospital decision, which are expected to vary across groups; and (3): Design and pilot test a personalized, interactive, consumer-focused website concerning the maternal hospital delivery decision, including useful and easy-to-understand inpatient quality measures. This product will draw from empirical evidence, consumer informatics theory, and web design best practices. The usefulness and usability of an English version will be pilot tested in 2 AA/PI groups (n=40) with disparities in Aim 1 and distinct preferences in Aim 2. A non-English version will be tested in an LEP group (n=20) with many speakers in the U.S., large health disparities from Aim 1, and known preferences from Aim 2.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will improve the science of consumer reporting of public hospital quality information by describing how individuals from diverse racial/ethnic groups and those with limited English proficiency use maternity- focused hospital quality information, what they value and understand from existing public reports on this topic, and whether additional information or presentation features might encourage higher use. We will use this information to design and test a personalized, consumer-focused website with the goal of improving the use of public hospital quality reports for pregnant women across diverse racial/ethnic and linguistic groups.",Hospital Quality Reports for Expectant Mothers: Considering Race and Language,8726858,R21HS021903,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R21,2014,311925,0.03572899616144202
"Cross-Language Outcomes of Bilingual Experience in Typical and Atypical Developme    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population. Identification of language impairment (SLI) and careful description of its trajectory during the school-age years is one area where disparities continue to exist. One population that is currently understudied is the Spanish-English bilingual school population. Significant strides have been made in the identification of markers of language impairment in young bilingual (Spanish-English) children. There are emerging strategies and instruments that guide identification of true impairment vs. language differences in this population (e.g., Gutiirrez-Clellen, Restrepo, & Simon-Cereijido, 2006; Gutiirrez-Clellen & Simon-Cereijido, 2007). There is also more detail about the kinds of language changes that bilingual children make in their two languages as they transition from the home to the school language (Hammer, Lawrence, & Miccio, 2008). A number of studies examine reading outcomes in bilingual children as well. However, there is a lack of systematic longitudinal studies examining the consequences of SLI in bilingual children. Spanish speakers are the largest language minority in the US and they make up 79 percent of the school age limited English speaking population. During the school age years children need to move quickly from basic conversational skills in English to development of academic language skills. Yet, during the early second language acquisition, performance in each language is highly variable, demonstrated by inconsistent levels of fluency across each language (Bialystok, 2001). ELL children with SLI are at higher risk for low educational and linguistic outcomes. The higher risk comes from at least two major sources: (1) lack of English proficiency that limits academic access; and (2) their language impairment that puts them at-risk for other academic difficulties. We propose to examine developmental outcomes in three domains (phonology/phonotactics, vocabulary/semantics, morphosyntax) in bilingual children at three ability levels (SLI, typical developing-at risk, typically developing). This project has two main phases. In phase 1 we focus on risk for language impairment as a function of Spanish/English exposure and use patterns across three grades (preschool, first grade, and third). In phase 2 a multiple longitudinal design will be employed that will include 4 overlapping cohorts to span the preschool through 5th grade age range. We incorporate processing tasks tied to each domain designed to tap into children's ability to alter processing with experience (i.e., short term learning). Here, we focus on learning trajectories for bilingual children with and without SLI. The results will provide a unique perspective on the linking of development across domains (e.g., phonological skills supporting acquisition of morphosyntactic forms), within and across a bilingual child's languages, as well as how development is modulated by language exposure, impairment, and variations in production processes.        One goal of the Healthy People 2010 program is to reduce health disparities across different segments of the population. Identification of language impairment (SLI) and careful description of its trajectory during the school-age years is one area where disparities continue to exist. One large population that is currently understudied is the Spanish-English bilingual school population. We propose to study bilingual children with and without language impairment in order to reduce health disparities. Understanding the relationships among phonology, semantics, and morphosyntax will provide insights about possible supports these children need for making gains in their two languages. Documenting changes in language processing over time in both languages will contribute to the scientific knowledge base about expected trajectories.

"Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes. The organization and practice of nursing have substantial positive effects on patient care and patient  outcomes. As a result of our NINR-sponsored research program continually funded since 1997, organization-based nursing interventions are now more often considered as potential solutions to poor quality and unsafe care. Organizational factors include nurse education, via preferential hiring practices  and educational benefits to employees~ nurse staffing, an evolving ""industry standard"" that has been the  focus of legislation~ human resource policies which determine nursing skill mix~ and the nursing work  environment-the organizational practices fostering the autonomy and authority required for nurses to  translate their education and experience into effective nursing care. In large, multi-state surveys of US nurses conducted in 1999 and in 2006, we have applied innovative sampling, aggregation, and measurement methods to provide rich information on nursing never before available for large numbers of  healthcare organizations that is linked to patient outcomes to document the empirical relationship between  nursing and outcomes. These data have been used to answer a range of compelling practice and policy questions about the contributions of nurses to safe, effective care. This application is an efficient, innovative extension of our line of research creating a large study of the impact of change in nursing factors on outcomes, seeking to determine more about causality in order to spur implementation of recommendations emerging from research. We will replicate in 2014 measurements made in 2006 (and 1999 in Pennsylvania) across approximately 665 hospitals and hundreds of nursing homes and home care agencies in four large states with measurement before and after the national economic downturn and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The great strength of the application is that in creating a panel of organizational observations, we can see where change has occurred and why. Specific aims are to: 1)  Collect data from random samples of nurses in CA, FL, NJ, and PA~ 2) Examine organizational-level  changes over time in nurse inputs in (a) education, (b) staffing, (c) skill mix, and (d) work environment  between 1999, 2006, and 2014~ 3) Estimate the effects of organizational-level changes on outcomes for  patients including minorities and those with chronic illnesses and determine whether lesser improvement in  nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has widened the disparity in outcomes between white and  minority patients~ and 4) Determine the effects of nursing factors in nursing home and home health agency  patient outcomes while accounting for variation in patient clinical severity and complexity.  The overarching aim of the proposed study is to determine points of comparatively low-cost organizational leverage of nursing inputs to improve patient outcomes.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In studying health care organizations over time, we learn what kinds of changes in nursing resources have occurred and thus are possible, and the consequences of changes for quality of care and patient outcomes.  Understanding more about the causal links between investments in nursing and patient outcomes will inform healthcare organizations about how to target their nursing investments to maximize safe, effective care for patients.               ",Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes,8669338,R01NR014855,"['Accounting ', ' California ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Environment ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Health ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitals ', ' Industry ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Methods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Solutions ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Home Care Agencies ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' nursing intervention ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' nursing skill ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' human capital ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' policy implication ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,679904,0.12553701233103734
"PROMIS-Deaf Profile: Inclusion of Deaf Patients in Disability and Outcomes Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current patient-reported outcome measures are heavily dependent on English, which present serious language barriers to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) patients who use American Sign Language (ASL). The availability of patient-reported outcome measures in ASL and English and such that is valid for users of accessible technology and services will provide important insights on improving prevention and treatment models that will lead to better personal and public health within the underserved DHH population. The research plan builds on Dr. Kushalnagar's prior research on communication and quality of life outcomes with deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) population. Communication-related fatigue is relevant to healthcare outcomes. Specific aims include (1) describing the linguistic and internal validity of PROMIS-Deaf profile, (2) examining QoL domains across DHH sub-groups, and (3) evaluating the prevalence of communicative stress and risk factors for health status and generic QoL in a nationwide sample of early-deafened adults. The study will be conducted by a research team that includes: an early career investigator with expertise in quality of life outcomes in DHH population, a senior investigator with expertise in patient reported outcome measures (the creator of the FACIT fatigue QoL measure), a psychometrician with experience in conducting IRT and psychometric analyses for patient reported outcome measures, an audiologist with expertise in (re)habilitative audiology and hearing related outcomes, an ASL translation expert, and a biostatistician. The Advisory Committee consists of experts on the subject matter related to the project and who are nationally known for their work with DHH population. Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that may contribute to poor quality of life frequently observed for individuals with hearing loss. The goals of this application are consistent with the NIDCD 2012-2016 strategies related to improving outcomes for human communication and reducing health disparities, and expected findings will support the development of a future grant proposal for a randomized study that will assess the ability of PROMIS- Deaf profile to detect minimally important changes with intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROMIS-Deaf profile is a patient reported outcome measure that is accessible in American Sign Language and English. Such measure that has been validated in these languages will allow future research and clinical trials to include deaf and har of hearing population without barrier.

"Bridges to the Doctorate in Nursing for Northeastern Ohio ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in the US have significant impact on the health of Americans. To successfully address health disparities requires increasing the number of scientists from the groups most commonly impacted by health disparities. As the largest group of health care professionals, nurses and nurse scientists have the potential to improve health disparities yet fewer than 2% of American RNs have PhDs. With the current national initiatives related to chronic diseases, the need for self-management, and ongoing health care reform to include team- based primary care, nurse scientists have the potential to make substantial and significant contributions to the science of improving health and to address health disparities. Yet there are too few nurse scientists, particularly from under-represented (UR) groups. The purpose of this project is to increase the number of nurse scientists from under-represented groups by providing a transitional program, bridging master's nursing students from Cleveland State University (CSU) and Ursuline College (UC) into the PhD program at the Frances Payne Bolton (FPB) School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University. Nursing, as a female predominant discipline, faces additional challenges in attaining PhDs beyond that faced by other scientific disciplines. Within MSN and PhD programs, there are increasing numbers of nurses from minority backgrounds, 29.3% and 27.7%, respectively. Despite this increased educational attainment, Schools of Nursing remain with too few nurse faculty from UR groups: fewer than 12% of nurse faculty come from minority backgrounds. The aims of the 5 year project are to: 1. Identify and recruit 5 cohorts of Bridges participants during their master's degree programs, one cohort (n = 4) in each year, and provide mentored research experience (years 1 through 5) 2. Provide joint mentoring by UC, CSU and FPB to Bridges participants (years 1 through 5) with a focus on identifying and addressing the gaps often experienced by students from UR groups to enhance retention and socialization into academic roles. 3. Admit Bridges student graduates from UC and CSU into PhD study at FPB/Case Western Reserve University. To accomplish these aims, have developed a plan to identify and recruit promising MSN students from UC and CSU who are in the MSN programs. We will select 2 students from CSU and 2 students from UC each year for a total of 20 students over the 5 year period. The Bridges students will then be assigned co-mentors, one from their MSN institution and one from FPB CWRU, and participate in paid mentored research experiences while they complete their MSNs. In addition, each cohort of 4 students will receive tailored programming to assist them in addressing needs and challenges that are specific to students from underrepresented groups.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nurse scientists can contribute to improvements in health disparities but there are too few nurse scientists from underrepresented groups.

"Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: A model to improve primary care for Hispanics with diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: An Intervention to Improve Nursing Care for Hispanics with Diabetes ABSTRACT Language barriers in healthcare are recognized as a leading determinant of health disparities among Hispanics in the United States.1 Limited English proficiency (LEP) has also been linked to the soaring diabetes epidemic among Hispanics. For Hispanics, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is 1.5 times that of non- Hispanic whites.3 Hispanic patients who do not speak English at home are at greater risk of foregoing diabetes care and they are significantly less likely than non-Hispanics to adopt a special diet for diabetes control, to exercise regularly, and to receive a yearly eye examination.6, 3 Recent research suggests that language concordance (LC) between patients and primary care providers is an effective precondition that improves outcomes in the treatment of LEP patients with diabetes. Interventions to increase the number of LC nurse practitioners consist of educational programs that develop second language (L2) abilities for health care professionals. A review of extant literature on L2 training for health professionals revealed that the preponderance of programs and materials are directed at basic levels of proficiency and confined to limited types of clinical interactions. The view of he present research team is that these programs and materials are substantially geared towards acute care and reflect a mismatch between an LEP patient population with chronic illnesses and a health professional workforce trained in L2 for acute care functions. This mismatch, we contend, exacerbates the difficulties faced by LEP patients with diabetes in achieving successful self- management and the physical and emotional wellness that goes along with it. This proposal describes the design and evaluation of an innovative educational intervention for nurse practitioner students called Integrated Language Learning for Chronic Care (IL2L). It pursues an integrated development of L2 and communication skills that will facilitate productive interactions between Spanish-speaking nurse practitioners and LEP Hispanic patients with diabetes. A mixed-method study design will be used to examine the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of the intervention. At the patient level, we will employ an RCT to determine the impact IL2L on the physical health, mental health, and self-efficacy of patients with uncontrolled diabetes. At the student level, we will employ the Roter Interaction Analysis System to measure gains in Spanish language interaction skills pre and post intervention. At the program level, we will use language program evaluation methodologies to assess the acceptability of the intervention within a nurse practitioner training program in a leading College of Nursing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: An Intervention to Improve Nursing Care for Hispanics with Diabetes PROJECT NARRATIVE Language barriers continues to impede access to quality care for limited English proficient populations. Recent research has demonstrated that access to language concordant providers increases quality of care.

"Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes. The organization and practice of nursing have substantial positive effects on patient care and patient  outcomes. As a result of our NINR-sponsored research program continually funded since 1997, organization-based nursing interventions are now more often considered as potential solutions to poor quality and unsafe care. Organizational factors include nurse education, via preferential hiring practices  and educational benefits to employees~ nurse staffing, an evolving ""industry standard"" that has been the  focus of legislation~ human resource policies which determine nursing skill mix~ and the nursing work  environment-the organizational practices fostering the autonomy and authority required for nurses to  translate their education and experience into effective nursing care. In large, multi-state surveys of US nurses conducted in 1999 and in 2006, we have applied innovative sampling, aggregation, and measurement methods to provide rich information on nursing never before available for large numbers of  healthcare organizations that is linked to patient outcomes to document the empirical relationship between  nursing and outcomes. These data have been used to answer a range of compelling practice and policy questions about the contributions of nurses to safe, effective care. This application is an efficient, innovative extension of our line of research creating a large study of the impact of change in nursing factors on outcomes, seeking to determine more about causality in order to spur implementation of recommendations emerging from research. We will replicate in 2014 measurements made in 2006 (and 1999 in Pennsylvania) across approximately 665 hospitals and hundreds of nursing homes and home care agencies in four large states with measurement before and after the national economic downturn and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The great strength of the application is that in creating a panel of organizational observations, we can see where change has occurred and why. Specific aims are to: 1)  Collect data from random samples of nurses in CA, FL, NJ, and PA~ 2) Examine organizational-level  changes over time in nurse inputs in (a) education, (b) staffing, (c) skill mix, and (d) work environment  between 1999, 2006, and 2014~ 3) Estimate the effects of organizational-level changes on outcomes for  patients including minorities and those with chronic illnesses and determine whether lesser improvement in  nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has widened the disparity in outcomes between white and  minority patients~ and 4) Determine the effects of nursing factors in nursing home and home health agency  patient outcomes while accounting for variation in patient clinical severity and complexity.  The overarching aim of the proposed study is to determine points of comparatively low-cost organizational leverage of nursing inputs to improve patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In studying health care organizations over time, we learn what kinds of changes in nursing resources have occurred and thus are possible, and the consequences of changes for quality of care and patient outcomes.  Understanding more about the causal links between investments in nursing and patient outcomes will inform healthcare organizations about how to target their nursing investments to maximize safe, effective care for patients.",Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes,8927071,R01NR014855,"['Accounting ', ' California ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Environment ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitals ', ' Industry ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Methods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Solutions ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Home Care Agencies ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' nursing intervention ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' nursing skill ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' human capital ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' policy implication ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,654229,0.12553701233103734
"User-driven Tool for Bilingual Clinical Dialogs and Medical Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent disparities in healthcare access hinder the nation's 26 million individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) from receiving quality care and, as a result, from achieving optimal health outcomes. Patients who struggle to understand their care providers report difficulty navigating both administrative and clinical procedures and experience significantly higher rates of delays in care delivery and poorer outcomes than their English-proficient counterparts. Despite numerous federal and state-level mandates for increased language assistance services, healthcare organizations have had limited success in tackling these challenges posed by the language barrier. This project aims to bring much-needed innovation to alleviate communication obstacles and accompanying health disparities. The envisioned solution will offer both in-clinic communication support and user-driven medical language skills acquisition training that can be accessed on desktop computers, touchscreen tablets, and mobile devices. The resultant system will leverage the medical provider community to identify actual in-clinic communication needs, which will drive the development of targeted learning materials that are relevant to the intended users. The medical interpreter community, a highly valuable but underutilized resource, will be leveraged to aid providers in their efforts to acquire second-language proficiency as well as provide on-demand live interpretations services through a streamlined method of connection on the envisioned product. The system will be evaluated by LEP patients, front-line healthcare providers, and certified medical interpreters to assess its ability to improve provider-patient communication and, in so doing, meaningfully contribute to addressing the health disparities facing these underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapidly growing population of persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) has profound implications for the healthcare system, as the miscommunications experienced by these individuals in clinical settings result in compromised care, and poses a greater financial burden on the hospitals that serve them compared to their English proficient counterparts. Directives from all levels of government to provide language assistance services to these underserved patients remain inadequately implemented, and the marketplace has similarly failed to provide practical and compelling solutions. In response to these challenges, this project will develop a comprehensive medical language assistance system that will both deliver engaging language skills acquisition training to providers and facilitate bilingual clinical dialog with their LEP patients, providing a much-needed solution with the potential to fill the void of effective medical communication tools and elevate the quality of care for a large segment of underserved patients.",User-driven Tool for Bilingual Clinical Dialogs and Medical Language Acquisition,8911194,R44MD008672,"['Aptitude ', ' Boston ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crowding ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Solutions ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' bilingualism ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' phrases ', ' skills ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' skill acquisition ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' prototype ', ' ']",NIMHD,"TRANSCENDENT INTERNATIONAL, LLC",R44,2015,651948,0.04901250320443535
"PROMIS-Deaf Profile: Inclusion of Deaf Patients in Disability and Outcomes Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current patient-reported outcome measures are heavily dependent on English, which present serious language barriers to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) patients who use American Sign Language (ASL). The availability of patient-reported outcome measures in ASL and English and such that is valid for users of accessible technology and services will provide important insights on improving prevention and treatment models that will lead to better personal and public health within the underserved DHH population. The research plan builds on Dr. Kushalnagar's prior research on communication and quality of life outcomes with deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) population. Communication-related fatigue is relevant to healthcare outcomes. Specific aims include (1) describing the linguistic and internal validity of PROMIS-Deaf profile, (2) examining QoL domains across DHH sub-groups, and (3) evaluating the prevalence of communicative stress and risk factors for health status and generic QoL in a nationwide sample of early-deafened adults. The study will be conducted by a research team that includes: an early career investigator with expertise in quality of life outcomes in DHH population, a senior investigator with expertise in patient reported outcome measures (the creator of the FACIT fatigue QoL measure), a psychometrician with experience in conducting IRT and psychometric analyses for patient reported outcome measures, an audiologist with expertise in (re)habilitative audiology and hearing related outcomes, an ASL translation expert, and a biostatistician. The Advisory Committee consists of experts on the subject matter related to the project and who are nationally known for their work with DHH population. Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that may contribute to poor quality of life frequently observed for individuals with hearing loss. The goals of this application are consistent with the NIDCD 2012-2016 strategies related to improving outcomes for human communication and reducing health disparities, and expected findings will support the development of a future grant proposal for a randomized study that will assess the ability of PROMIS- Deaf profile to detect minimally important changes with intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROMIS-Deaf profile is a patient reported outcome measure that is accessible in American Sign Language and English. Such measure that has been validated in these languages will allow future research and clinical trials to include deaf and har of hearing population without barrier.

"A Data-driven Approach to Improve Nursing Workflow and Patient-centered Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care recognizes patients' desires, opinions, and preferences as equal in importance to those of healthcare professionals, and emphasizes the need to educate and empower patients to play an active role in their care. The achievement of patient-centered care is associated with increased patient and provider satisfaction, improved health outcomes, and reduced cost of care delivery (Caffarini, 2011; Silow-Carol et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2008). Furthermore, as health disparities continue to persist, patient-centered care offers underserved patients the individualized and tailored care necessary to attain positive health outcomes. As the providers who spend more time with patients than any other personnel, nursing staff are central to the provision of patient-centered care (De Lucia et al., 2009). However, most of these front-line providers are burdened by numerous non-value added tasks that not only distract from direct patient care activities, but also hamper their ability to implement best practices such as proven care plans for preventing adverse events (e.g., falls and pressure ulcers) among at-risk patients (Hendrich et al., 2008; Storfjell et al., 2008; Aiken et al., 2002). The occurrence of such preventable events is especially concerning in light of the fact that such events fall disproportionately on already underserved populations, including certain racial/ethnic communities, limited English speaking individuals, and the elderly (Divi et al., 2007; Metersky et al., 2011; Rothschild et al., 2000). Fr patient-centered care to be truly realized, the healthcare system must introduce process innovations that can streamline mundane, indirect tasks such as service documentation for front-line nursing care providers and enable them to efficiently adopt value added clinical practices that benefit direct patient care activities. In this project, we will engage several partners-including a skilled nursing facility that serves predominantly monolingual Spanish- and Chinese-speaking communities and a long-term care facility for retired veterans-to implement an advanced patient-nurse communication and nurse workflow optimization system. This solution will: (i) track comprehensive care plans and associated tasks for individual patients; (ii intelligently assign and alert each provider of his or her care plan tasks, escalating pending tasks to appropriate staff members to expedite completion; and (iii) offer real-time analysis of task fulfillment status and workflow patterns, providing decision support to both staff and managers for identifying factors that may undermine staff productivity or contribute to adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patient-centered care is associated with increased quality and satisfaction with health services, and has significant potential to improve health outcomes for communities that experience health disparities; however, numerous indirect and often burdensome tasks hinder most nurses from delivering truly patient-centered care. To increase time available for direct bedside patient interactions, this project will develop a patient-nurse communication and workflow optimization tool specifically for streamlining nursing care protocols. By offering nurses full visibility of their workload, efficient interactive checklists fr carrying out upcoming tasks, and low- burden documentation capabilities from virtually any location in the unit, this innovative system will empower nurses to reduce time spent on low-value, indirect care tasks and be better able to account for individual patients' communication needs, thereby transforming the care environment to support patient-centered care delivery and sustained improvement in patient outcomes.",A Data-driven Approach to Improve Nursing Workflow and Patient-centered Care,9109734,R44MD009581,"['Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' starling (bird) ', ' Sturnidae ', ' Starlings ', ' Sturnus vulgaris ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' authority ', ' member ', ' drinking ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Documentation ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Nursing Informatics ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cost ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' direct patient care ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' task analysis ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' clinical practice ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' arm ', ' Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Video Display Terminals ', ' Computer Terminals ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K-07 award for Dr. Lisa Diamond, a clinician-investigator in the Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The applicant's long-term career goal is to contribute to the policy recommendations needed to eliminate healthcare disparities for cancer patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). Her research is aimed at understanding how clinician non- English language proficiency influences quality of care and outcomes for cancer patients with LEP. The work described in this proposal represents the first evidence-based approach to inform guidelines for the care of cancer patients with LEP. Dr. Diamond's background in health services research, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, through the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program positions her well to accomplish this. Through the proposed career development activities she seeks to gain additional skills towards achieving independence as a scientific investigator with a program of training in large database analysis and its relationship to policy formation, dissemination and implementation research, and the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a widely used rigorous method of coding medical interactions. True language concordance occurs when clinicians are fluent in the language that their patient speaks and reduces disparities among LEP patients. Partial language concordance may adversely impact the quality of cancer care provided to LEP patients. The applicant's research agenda is to gather the evidence to inform national and local standards for the appropriate use of non-English language skills by clinicians. Without standards, LEP cancer patients have the potential to misunderstand diagnoses and treatment recommendations, leading to treatment non- adherence.  Dr. Diamond proposes to accomplish this through the three aims in this career development award. First, she will identify the content of any existing policies on clinician use of non-English language skills and interpreters at hospitals that frequently serve cancer patients and to determine the factors associated with having such a policy. This will be accomplished by surveying the NCI-designated Cancer Centers nationally, the NCI Community Oncology Research Program sites, and minority-serving hospitals in New York City (NYC). Second, she will test the feasibility of using the RIAS across different languages to describe the nature of communication between clinicians and LEP cancer patients presenting for an initial visit at three minority- serving hospitals in NYC. Third, she will assess the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency, non- English language use, and interpreter use on completion of cancer treatment, quality of life, depression, and stress among a population of LEP cancer patients at the same 3 hospitals participating in Aim 2. Through the proposed career development and research activities, the applicant seeks to acquire new skills and knowledge that will complement her existing research abilities in order to improve cancer care to patients with LEP.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since many clinicians who provide language concordant care are not native speakers of their patients' languages, studies are needed to help understand the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency on quality of cancer care for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). There are no national or state guide- lines to direct a clinician's decision to use his/her non-English language skills or a professional interpreter with LEP patients. It is critical to gather the evidence for standards addressing when it is acceptable to use one's own non-English language skills with LEP cancer patients and when professional interpreters are essential.            ",Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care,8890972,K07CA184037,"['Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Research Technics ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Wood ', ' Wood material ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Diamond ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Roter ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Nature ', ' English Language ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' skills ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K07,2015,180036,0.030384904507675333
"RISE Program Option I: University of Puerto Rico at Cayey DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The RISE program continues to transform the academic environment at UPR-Cayey by focusing on the preparation of students to become scientists. As part of this long term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in four areas, 1- their lack of awareness for career opportunities and of their own potential, 2- their limited research skills and experience, 3- limited quantitative and qualitative skills, and 4- limited English language skills. These were identified and interventions will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. To address these needs, five developmental activities are prescribed- visiting scientists, research skills, discovery chemistry, language skills, and research experiences. Reaching the entire science community, visiting alumni scientists provide seminars and workshops in English to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. Improving the skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having activities related to research techniques, scientific literacy, and language skills. RISE students will take Discovery Chemistry to quantitative and qualitative skills. Research experiences for twelve students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators at four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 60 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the USA. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: 1) research and language skills with faculty mentors; 2) motivational visiting alumni scientists; 3) inquiry methodology by chemistry faculty and 4) research lab experience with either on- island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the USA. Each expert group challenges the students as they develop utilizing the appropriate environment and level of expertise to produce UPRC alumni who will be biomedical research scientists. During the last 5 years (2005-09), 32 RISE alumni completed Ph.D.s from major research universities; a 100% increase over the previous five-year period. By doubling the number of Ph.D. alumni, RISE will impact the community. These UPRC scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases. The RISE program continues to transform the academic environment at UPR-Cayey by focusing on the preparation of students to become scientists.

"Hispanic Role Models in Health Care Careers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers:  Empowering Hispanic Nurses to Leverage Traditional Spanish language and New Social Media to Inspire the Next Generation of Culturally Diverse  and Competent Health Care Professionals The National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN), in association with the Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), proposes to address the shortage of bilingual professionals in all health fields by recruiting and interviewing bilingual role models and arranging to broadcast those interviews nationwide. Leveraging HCN's nationally broadcast health education radio shows, whose cumulative audiences are larger than NPR's ""All Things Considered,"" this project has the potential to reach one out of every three US Hispanics during its first five years. This media campaign is intended to inspire Hispanic parents to encourage their children to study science and aspire to careers in the biomedical professions. It is also intended to inspire and empower Spanish-speaking adults from all walks of life to consider careers in the health professions. All broadcasts will tie to NAHN's interactive website so that students and adults interested in changing careers can find mentors and educational resources.         NAHN will also use YouTube, Facebook, mobile phone applications, and other new and popular social media technologies to reach a broad cross-section of English speaking youth and young adults.         In addition to the national media outputs, attendees at NAHN's annual conferences will have the opportunity to receive training in public speaking and media relations so they can more effectively use local media in their own communities to address health disparities and promote careers in the biomedical and health professions.         NAHN will develop a standardized, bilingual Toolkit for public presentations. The Toolkit will include a Powerpoint presentation embedded with video containing gender- and other- stereotype-busting role model interviews with Hispanic nurses; links to an online database of volunteer mentors; and a bilingual terminology packet that will aid nurses in creating linguistic and cognitive bridges between audience and professional knowledge bases. We expect that the refined Toolkit will empower nurses and other health professionals to become more effective public health educators and career role models during their presentations at community health events, career fairs, achievement clubs, and school assemblies.        An Advisory Committee of other health organizations, professionals, and advocates will recommend Role Models and provide periodic feedback.         Bilingual independent evaluators associated with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health will conduct qualitative and quantitative formative, iterative, and summative evaluations throughout the project. Their recommendations and findings will be incorporated into the project design and deliverables and shared with relevant fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers, a collaboration of the National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN) and Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), addresses the need for cultural and linguistic diversity among health professionals. HCN will broadcast interviews of Role Models on its 250 affiliated Spanish-language popular radio stations nationwide to inform Spanish-speakers about the range of health careers open to them with proper education and to inspire them to imagine themselves as successful professionals. This effort will be combined with the creation of a number of bilingual online resources for health career aspirants, including an extensive database of volunteer professionals who have said ""Si!Sere Mentor!""

"Defining a National Cohort of Assisted Living Residents     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the over 710,000 older adults residing daily in the 22,000+ assisted living (AL) facilities in the US. This is primarily due to our inability to identify AL residents with secondary data as we have for beneficiaries receiving services in nursing homes (NHs). The long-term goal of this research agenda is to study the changing landscape of long-term care (LTC) and to understand the role of AL in providing quality care to our nation's most at-risk elders in much the same manner previously done with NHs. Critical impediments to this goal is the lack of a national dataset of ALs, a methodology to identify and track AL residents' LTC trajectories, and an understanding of how changes in the AL market affects other LTC sectors. To address this problem, our main goals of this application include the collection of an updated national census of AL providers to validate a methodology for identifying AL residents using secondary data sources. The rationale that underlies this proposed re`	search is that a national dataset of AL providers, a validated method to identify AL residents, and an understanding of the effect of the growth in the national AL market will, for the first time, allow researchers to investigate in more detail the national landscape of AL utilization and resident outcomes. The specific aims include: 1) To compile, geocode, match to other LTC data, and make publicly available a 2013 national dataset of AL providers on LTCfocUS.org, 2) To test the validity of a methodology for identifying AL residents against samples of Medicare beneficiaries receiving healthcare services within an AL and 3) To evaluate the effect of changes in the geographic supply of AL beds between 2007 and 2013 on the private-pay NH market. Our research is innovative because we will be the first to supply a national dataset of ALs and we put forward a new and unique approach to identify AL residents, namely the use of the 9-digit ZIP code reported in Medicare enrollment records, which we will validate by combining Home Health assessment data and Medicare Part B Place of Service Codes. In addition, we will improve our ability to identify the relationship of changing AL supply with the market for NH care by creating an innovative measure that captures the number of private-pay resident days in NHs on a national scale. Consequently, a better understanding of the effect of the changing AL market on NH private-pay occupancy and length of stay is expected to result. This work is significant because as more private, State, and Federal dollars are spent on AL, identifying users of these services, tracking their healthcare utilization and outcomes, and understanding the impact on other LTC market sectors becomes crucial. In addition, findings from this research have the strong potential for providing us the fist step in a continuum of research to be proposed in an R01 grant application following the completion of this work that is expected to elucidate provider quality, AL resident outcomes (e.g. hospitalization and NH placement), racial and ethnic disparities, and healthcare costs associated with this large, growing site of LTC.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to NIA's mission because in order to understand the role of assisted living (AL) in providing quality long-term care (LTC), we need to be able to identify AL facilities, the residents within these facilities, and the impactit has on other sectors of LTC. This work will provide the necessary stepping stone for future research aimed at informing researchers and policymakers how to administer and finance LTC in ways that ultimately result in optimum improvements in the health and well-being of older people needing LTC.            ",Defining a National Cohort of Assisted Living Residents,8822070,R21AG047303,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Beds ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Calculi ', ' Censuses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economic Models ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' SMI Program ', ' Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance Program ', ' Medicare Part B ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Residential Care Institutions ', ' residential care facility ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Licensing ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' rapid growth ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,241329,-0.013619888867169395
"Bridges to the Bacclaureate Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) partnership between the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing (NHWSN) at Emory University and the Nursing Program at Georgia Perimeter College (GPC). The program focuses on identifying students from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups - groups who are underrepresented in nursing and nursing science as well - and supporting them through the associate degree to the baccalaureate in nursing (BSN) and on to careers in nursing science in the PhD program in Nursing at Emory or at similar research-intensive institutions. BttB aims to increase the number of underrepresented students who complete the AS degree in Nursing at GPC and enter the BSN program at NHWSN; who develop skills and knowledge in nursing science; and who are socialized into the culture and profession of nursing science and move forward to doctoral studies. BttB responds to national needs to address the nursing shortage by developing a next generation of nursing scientists to be faculty in schools of nursing who both teach and create the evidence for improved practice. It also addresses the IOM call for nursing leadership to work with other professions to develop innovative solutions to the nation's health care crisis and to the persistent problem of health disparities. The BttB program will consist of five elements; (1) recruitment and enrollment; (2) research exposure; (3) research immersion; (4) academic programming; and (5) mentoring, advising, and counseling. Faculty from both institutions will participate in selecting GPC students into the BttB program in their first semester in the GPC nursing program. Research roundtables and summer and school-year research immersion experiences will strengthen the environment of research at GPC and will enable students to learn about nursing science both conceptually and experientially. The roundtable and immersion experiences will continue when students transfer to NHWSN and enter an RN-BSN program that is specifically tailored to accommodate their prior training and to further immerse them in nursing science. At NHWSN, BttB students will be in an environment characterized by the active conduct of funded research by a large number of tenured and tenure track faculty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) program seeks to move underrepresented students from an associate degree in nursing (AS) program through a bachelor degree in nursing (BSN) program and to a point of readiness for doctoral training in nursing science.

"The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality of treatment for cancer-associated complications, those complications directly attributable to the cancer itself or that result from chemotherapy and/or radiation, have received little attention. This is particularly problematic as cancer-associated complications are associated with significant morbidity, are often accompanied by pain and discomfort, and require the expenditure of substantial healthcare resources for treatment. The management of cancer-associated complications is compounded by the availability of a myriad of treatment options, many of which are unproven and associated with significant cost. Little is known about the factors that influence allocation of care for thes complications and what factors influence outcome. The health care a patient receives and its associated outcomes are influenced by the interplay of a number of patient, physician, and hospital factors. For acute inpatient medical conditions the characteristics of the hospital in which a patient is treated play a crucial role. There is growing recognition that there is widespread between-hospital variation in how care is allocated and that these differences in practice patterns explain a large portion of treatment variability. Uninsured and minority patients are particularly vulnerable to these hospital level disparities as these patients are disproportionately more likely to receive care at facilities with limited clinical and financial resources that may adversely affect quality. In this proposal we will determine the quality of treatment for hospitalized patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of: febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia of malignancy, esophagitis, and acute cancer-associated pain. For each cancer-associated complication we will determine patterns of treatment, the factors that underlie treatment decisions, and the effect of prompt initiation of guideline-based therapy on outcomes. For each condition we will first examine the utilization of guideline-based and non-indicated treatments. We will then comprehensively examine the influence of patient, physician, and hospital characteristics as well as between- hospital variations on the allocation of guideline-based care. We hypothesize that there is substantial variation in treatment between hospitals that is unexplained by traditional measures. Finally, we will perform novel causal inference and mediation analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects operating through a mediator of prompt guideline-based treatment on outcomes (length of stay, readmission, cost, non-routine discharge and mortality) for each complication. In addition to including a number of novel statistical methodologies, this proposal will utilize a unique database ideally suited to the study of these complications. The data from these studies will lead to immediately actionable results that can be used to guide the implementation pragmatic hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To date, the complications that result either directly from cancer or from its treatment have received almost no attention. Our findings will provide important data on the management of these complications to patients, providers, and payers that are immediately actionable and can guide the development of targeted hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications.",The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp,8804245,R01CA169121,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Expenditure ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neutropenia ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Consensus ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' novel ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Treatment-Associated Cancer ', ' Therapy-Related Cancer ', ' Therapy-Associated Cancers ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Tumor ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Iatrogenic Cancer ', ' Treatment-Related Cancer ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' chemotherapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' high risk ', ' common treatment ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,332000,-0.01548694870834524
"Understanding Racial and Geographic Disparities in Hospital Observation Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last decade, observation care-a hospital-based outpatient service used to evaluate and treat acutely ill patients for extended periods-has become an increasingly common, but controversial, alternative to full hospitalization affecting more than 1 million Medicare beneficiaries annually (National Center for Health Statistics 2010; Feng et al. 2012). Proponents argue that observation care represents an alternative to short- stay hospitalization (< 48 hours) and a net cost savings to the health system, while critics argue that observation care shifts the cost burden of expensive inpatient care onto patients, and may compromise the quality of care (Baugh et al. 2011; Ross and Bellamy 2010). There is also significant variation in observation care use-including racial and geographic disparities-and it is unclear both what drives these disparities and whether observation care results in better or worse patient-centered outcomes than short-stay hospitalizations (Feng et al. 2012). Thus, the overall objective of this study is to understand the causes of racial and geographic disparities in the use of observation care among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and the implications of these disparities for patient-centered outcomes. In pursuit of this objective, the proposed study has the following specific aims: 1) To determine the extent to which disparities in observation care are driven by patient and hospital level factors; and 2) To assess the association between observation care and patient- centered outcomes by race and rurality. To achieve these aims, four years of Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims and enrollment data (2007-2010) will be used to model observation stay rates as a function of variation in patient race and rurality within and between hospitals. Then, the 30- and 90-day ED visit, hospital readmission, and mortality rates of patients placed in observation care versus those placed in short-stay admission (d 48 hours) will be evaluated, controlling for a variety of factors including patient comorbidities. Heterogeneity in the impact of observation on outcomes by race and rurality will also be evaluated. The proposed research is significant because it will indicate whether disparities in health outcomes could potentially be reduced by policies that address disparities in observation care use, and whether policy strategies to reduce disparities in the use of observation care should be targeted towards individuals, system-level factors, or both. The proposed research is innovative because it uses comprehensive national person-level Medicare claims data to investigate racial and geographic disparities in the use of observation care to identify both its upstream and downstream consequences, and will assess for the first time the impact of the decision to admit or observe on health outcomes. This study is expected to have an immediate positive impact on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) policymakers, payers, providers, and hospitals as they develop policies on the appropriate use of observation care. As these policies are implemented by CMS and other payers to improve the quality of care and reduce disparities, patients will be the ultimate beneficiaries of this researc. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to clarify the causes of racial and geographic disparities in the use of observation care and identify the consequences of these disparities for a variety of subsequent health outcomes. In particular, the results are expected to inform the development of policies on the appropriate use of observation care, which may help control health care costs and ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries get access to the most appropriate and effective care for their condition. The project is relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Aging because it focuses on understanding and eliminating racial and geographic disparities affecting the health and health care of older adults.",Understanding Racial and Geographic Disparities in Hospital Observation Care,8842075,R21AG047102,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cost shifting ', ' development policy ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.) ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Time ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Hour ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' beneficiary ', ' critical access hospital ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2015,186280,-0.01938169454672915
"Impacts of nursing home competition & state policies on disparities in quality DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Racial/ethnic minorities made up about 16 percent of the nursing home population in 2004. More recent data suggest that the number of minority nursing homes residents is increasing dramatically, while the number of white residents is declining. These new demographic changes raise concerns about whether nursing homes are able to serve appropriately the needs of patients with increasingly diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The quality of care delivered in nursing homes has been a longstanding issue plaguing the industry, and continues to be the focus of federal and state policies aimed at improving it. Extant evidence suggests that these policies, including strengthened state quality regulations, improved Medicaid reimbursements, and more recent efforts to foster market competition (e.g., the repeal of the Certificate of Need requirement; the national quality reporting), have improved nursing home quality and outcomes during the past decade. As the industry makes headway and improves quality in response to these policy and market trends, it is important to recognize that improvements in overall nursing home quality may not automatically benefit all subgroups of patients equally. Indeed, despite evidence of overall improvements, a large body of literature continues to document racial/ethnic disparities in nursing home quality. In particular, our recent work, published in the Journal of American Medical Association, has for the first time provided evidence that while pressure ulcer outcomes in nursing homes have improved for both non-Hispanic whites and minorities, the gap between these two groups of patients remained unchanged. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to answer two very important questions: 1) Does this phenomenon, of improvement in quality for all concomitant with a persistent gap between racial/ethnic groups, exist in other areas of known disparities for nursing home care? and 2) Can we identify specific policy and market characteristics that have been successful not only in improving quality but also in closing the racial and ethnic gap in quality?

"Racial disparities in hospital use and quality of care for coronary heart disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research suggests that racial disparities in heart disease treatment are due in part to differences in the quality of hospitals used by white and black patients. One possible explanation is that blacks live in neighborhoods with worse hospitals. However, recent studies have found that blacks are also more likely than whites to travel beyond reputable, high quality hospitals, especially for non-urgent specialized treatments, even when they live close to these facilities. Thus, factors other than location may play a role in how blacks and whites use high and low quality hospitals. We assume that, even after accounting for location, black patients are more likely to use lower quality hospital and hospitals that are located in majority black neighborhoods or have a sizable black clientele. This may be the consequence of differences in physician referrals or patient distrust of predominantly white institutions, and is likely to result in higher rates of bypass of high-quality hospitals among blacks. We further assume that the racial differences in how blacks and whites use high and low quality hospitals are more pronounced in metro areas with high residential segregation and in neighborhoods with high social disadvantage. The proposed research will focus on three cardiac conditions with various degrees of acuity - acute myocardial infarction, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery - and will use several national data sources, including Medicare files to identify patients and hospitals they use; American Hospital Association surveys for hospital characteristics; and the US Census to obtain zip code and metro area demographics and segregation measures. Analyses will employ state-of-the-art methods developed specifically for the study of hospital choice. The study will enhance our understanding of causal pathways in health care disparities by answering important questions related to factors contributing to racial differences in hospital care for the treatment of heart disease. Does geography play a role in black and white seniors' access to high quality hospitals? Is a hospital's neighborhood racial composition particularly salient to black seniors? Are these effects modified by the degree of metro area residential segregation? What is the contribution of differences in geographic access, and of differences in how black and white seniors choose hospitals, to the segregation of health care quality? The proposed study will address these and many more questions. Further, by quantifying the relative roles of geography and hospital choice behavior, the study will provide valuable information to local policy makers aiming to reduce disparities in their respective metro areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will evaluate the role of geographic and social context factors in how black and white seniors choose hospitals for the treatment of heart disease. The study is relevant to public health and policy makers by 1) identifying areas with poor geographic access to high-quality hospitals that could be targeted for quality improvement; and 2) enhancing our understanding of how hospital, neighborhood, and metro area factors affect the use of high and low quality hospitals and, more generally, the segregation of health care delivery. Enhanced understanding will enable us to design completely new interventions targeted at, for example, improving relationships and trust between communities and health care institutions.",Racial disparities in hospital use and quality of care for coronary heart disease,8787782,R01HL118410,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Communities ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hospitals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' reperfusion ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Travel ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' intraluminal angioplasty ', ' Angioplasty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' Bypass ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,336073,0.03200735332180106
"UCLA/CDU Partnership for Enhancing Diversity of Nurses with Research Careers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities for individuals from under-represented minority groups (URMGs) continue to plague the US population. The roots of this problem are many and complex, but of great relevance is the dearth of individuals from URMGs in the health professions workforce, with serious disparities in the ethnic/racial composition of the workforce being particularly pronounced in nursing. The 2008 NSSRN survey showed 32.1% of Black/African American nurses and 39.4% of Latino nurses had baccalaureate degrees; for all racial/ethnic groups combined, only 11.4% had graduate degrees including PhDs. This state exists at a time when the US population is becoming older and more ethnically diverse. Given this dire state of affairs, we are proposing to enhance an existing relationship between the Schools of Nursing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU), an Historically Black Graduate Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution, for the purpose developing and implementing an integrated plan of individual and institutional activities to prepare masters students from URMGs to make a seamless transition to doctoral education. The long term goal of this project is to increase the ethnic/racial diversity of those prepared to pursue research careers in nursing focusing on research about aging adults (45+ years) by (1) increasing involvement of master's students and faculty at CDU SON in the scientific enterprise through structured development activities; (2) enriching the research course offerings and scientific environment at CDU SON to prepare master's students to seamlessly transition to doctoral education; and (3) facilitating student advancement to the UCLA SON via systems that facilitate student enrollment and scientific exchange between faculty at UCLA and CDU. Health disparities persist despite efforts to curb them. Encouraging more diverse, underrepresented minority individuals to pursue doctoral education in the health care field, such as nursing, is one documented way to reduce health disparities. This application proposes collaboration between University of California Los Angeles and Charles Drew University to provide the supportive and educational activities required to prepare a more diverse nursing workforce at the doctoral level, who will ask the relevant research questions and develop the science that will ultimately reduce health disparities.",UCLA/CDU Partnership for Enhancing Diversity of Nurses with Research Careers,8918679,R25GM102777,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' California ', ' Censuses ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Health Occupations ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' R.N.

"Organizational Determinants of ICU Telemedicine Effectiveness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment in an ICU staffed by appropriately trained intensivist clinicians improves survival in critically ill patients. Yet many patients lack access o this level of critical care, particularly in small hospital and rural geographic areas, leading to excess mortality and creating significant socioeconomic disparities. To address this problem many hospitals have adopted ICU telemedicine, a health care delivery innovation which uses audio---visual technology to provide critical care services from a distance. By expanding access to high-quality critical care, ICU telemedicine has great potential to improve survival in critical illness. However, the success of telemedicine is hindered by critical deficiencies in our understanding of how and where this technology is best applied. Telemedicine is a complex intervention, and existing programs vary significantly in both the components of intervention and the clinical setting in which it is used. In turn, studies of telemedicine demonstrate mixed result, with some showing a large mortality benefit and others showing no benefit or even suggesting harm. As a result, decision makers have little guidance regarding how and where to use this potentially transformative technology, if at all. In this project we will address this knowledge ga by identifying the key clinical and organizational factors associated with ICU telemedicine effectiveness. Our central hypothesis is that objective, measurable, clinical and organizational factors will distinguish effective programs from ineffective ones. First, we will use national data on Medicare beneficiaries and an innovative risk--- adjustment procedure to quantify hospital---level variation in the impact of ICU telemedicine on patient mortality, ranking each hospital that has adopted ICU telemedicine from most effective to least effective. Second, we will conduct site visits at five hospitals with the greatest telemedicine effect and five hospitals with least telemedicine effect; along with two site visits at hospitals that have stopped using ICU telemedicine; performing in-depth qualitative analyses to identify the clinical and organizational factors associated with ICU telemedicine effectiveness. Third, we will develop and field a survey of all US hospitals that have adopted ICU telemedicine, linking the survey back to patient---level outcomes data and quantitatively defining ICU telemedicine clinical and organizational ""best practices"". By shifting the paradigm of ICU telemedicine evaluation away from whether it works to how and where it works best, this project will be the first rigorous examination of the factors that define successful ICU telemedicine implementation. Ultimately, these results will provide clinicians, hospital administrators with immediate, actionable data about how to use ICU telemedicine most effectively and efficiently, directly leading to improved access to critical care and improved survival for critically ill patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Between 4 and 7 million patients are admitted to an intensive care unit in the United States each year, and one---fifth of all Americans will die during a hospitalization that involves intensive care. By identifying the ways to best implement telemedicine in the ICU, this project will provide will provide clinicians, researchers and policy makers with important tools to expand access to high quality critical care and improve survival in patients with critical illness, particularly in small hospitals and rural areas.",Organizational Determinants of ICU Telemedicine Effectiveness,8898905,R01HL120980,"['Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Measurable ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Site Visit ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' beneficiary ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,524419,0.04129571322035079
"State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate NETT Clinical Site Hub DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center has created a Clinical Site Hub and Spoke NETT to join a national clinical research network. Our 5-hospital NETT, included within federally designated underserved areas, serves a large minority population, will conduct clinical trials designed to develop effective treatments for patients with neurological emergencies. Our existing infrastructure of the Hub at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, with joint experienced leadership from Emergency Medicine and Neurology, has established 2 large spokes: Lincoln Hospital (south Bronx), serving primarily Hispanics, and Maimonides Medical Center (Brooklyn), one of the largest independent teaching hospitals in the US.

"Impacts of payment reform on racial disparities in hospital psychiatric care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In July 2014, Maryland implemented a statewide hospital payment reform that includes global capitated budgeting to increase efficiency and performance incentives to improve quality. By encouraging hospitals to address the unmet needs of minority patients, this sweeping change has the potential to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in care coordination for individuals who are hospitalized as a result of a mental healt condition. However, such payment reforms, if not carefully designed, could incentivize ""safety-net"" hospitals, which provide access to psychiatric care in low-income minority urban communities, to offer fewer psychiatric services in order to reduce costs. In this study, hospitals administrative data are used in a non-experimental difference-in-difference-in-differences regression framework to examine the effects of the Maryland payment reform on racial-ethnic disparities in hospital-based psychiatric care at safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals. The study's primary outcomes are receipt of outpatient follow-up and transitional care management services after a psychiatric inpatient stay, hospital readmission, and hospital spending per patient for psychiatric services. These impacts are identified by comparing changes in Maryland (the intervention state) with changes in Pennsylvania (the comparison state) after, versus before, July 2014. This proposed study is significant and timely because it can inform policymakers' assessments of how similar ""value- based"" hospital payment reforms in other states can be designed to improve care for minority patients while preserving the psychiatric care safety-net in low-income minority communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although ""value-based"" health care payment reforms might reduce racial-ethnic disparities in health care coordination for individuals receiving psychiatric inpatient care, such payment reforms, if not carefully designed, could instead result in reduced access to psychiatric care services in predominantly low-income minority communities.

"Language Barriers and Post-Acute Outcomes in Home Care: A Mixed Methods Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immigrants comprise 13% of the US population and 25.2 million US residents are categorized as having limited English speaking skills, defined as the inability to understand healthcare communication in English. The number of limited English proficiency (LEP) individuals living in the US grew 80% between 1990 and 2010 and they represent 10% or more of the populations in the 13 most highly populous states. As a result, healthcare workers in the US are more likely than ever to regularly encounter LEP patients in their practice. Language barriers likely pose a particularly vexing problem for the complex care coordination processes that occur when patients transition from the hospital to home care, representing an understudied problem. We know that LEP status increases a patient's risk for readmission between 15 and 25% and that there are effective means for reducing these barriers, e.g. adequate interpreter services. Yet there is a critical gap in our understanding of how language barriers impact the transition to home healthcare and the personnel, patient, and organizational factors that might influence post-acute discharge outcomes in LEP patients. Our overall goal is to understand how language barriers impact 30-day rehospitalization and home healthcare resource utilization among LEP patients recently discharged from the hospital, with a secondary aim of understanding their impact on functional status. We will accomplish this goal by conducting a mixed methods study in partnership with The Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), which documents the language skills and abilities of its employees and patients thereby allowing us to identify linguistically concordant visits in its extensive database of over  million LEP patient visits coming from 86,000 clients, with four language groups (Spanish, Korean, Russian, Chinese). This unique but nationally representative dataset and the New York City location of the study offers an appropriate environment to study this problem. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the largest and most diverse study of the influence of language barriers on critical clinical patient outcomes in the US. Results from this study will have policy and research implications for the organization and management of care coordination for LEP patients. This study will complement existing initiatives at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality focused on improving patient-provider communication for LEP patient populations, reducing racial and ethnic health disparities, improving care for vulnerable populations, improving post-hospital discharge processes, and addressing patient safety across the healthcare system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One fifth of households in the United States speak a language other than English at home. By examining the associations between patient-provider language concordance, interpreter use, and post-acute care outcomes in the home healthcare setting along with ascertaining the dynamics of systemic care coordination issues, we can ensure that patients with a language barrier do not have their health outcomes adversely affected after a hospitalization episode. This will be the largest study of the impact of the healthcare system on LEP patient outcomes, including re-hospitalization, with implications that will make a major impact on US health services.            ",Language Barriers and Post-Acute Outcomes in Home Care: A Mixed Methods Analysis,8962855,R01HS023593,[''],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,249868,0.06769545866144662
"Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent racial disparities in neonatal mortality rates are a major public health concern. Black neonates are more than twice as likely to die as white neonates. In previous research in New York City (NYC) hospitals, we found nearly a three-fold variation in risk-adjusted very low birth weight (VLBW) neonatal mortality rates among hospitals and black infants were much more likely to be born at higher mortality hospitals. The factors that influence wide variation in mortality rates among hospitals are not known. Why black women are more likely to deliver at higher mortality hospitals is also unknown. The objectives of this study are: 1) To examine risk- adjusted neonatal mortality among New York City hospitals over the past decade and assess the extent to which variations in hospital quality contribute to VLBW mortality disparities for blacks and Latinos; 2) To use an innovative mixed methods approach to explore processes of care, unit characteristics, patient factors, and organizational factors that explain differences in hospital quality as measured by overall and cause-specific risk-adjusted mortality rates and use of evidence-based practices; 3) To explore patients' perspectives on barriers to receipt of high quality care by exploring barriers to timely care, communication, availability of high risk obstetrics care, knowledge, decision-making regarding delivery hospital, and perception of risk; and 4) To create specific strategies with key stakeholders to promote uptake of best practices at hospitals caring for VLBW infants including patient-centered strategies to minimize barriers to receipt of high quality care. Methods: In Phase 1, we will use NYC Vital Statistics records linked with New York State Discharge Abstract Data to develop a risk-adjusted VLBW neonatal mortality model. We will use this model to rank hospitals based on risk-adjusted mortality. We will then examine the distribution of black, Latino, and white births among hospitals. In Phases 2 and 3 we will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to determine which hospital factors and practice patterns may explain the wide variation in mortality outcomes among hospitals and to explore why black mothers deliver in higher mortality hospitals. We will then convene leaders of obstetrics and neonatologists, hospital quality leaders, community leaders, NYC and State Departments of Health, and patients to discuss our results and explore interventions to improve care for VLBW infants. Information from this study will provide a better understanding of quality in neonatal care in hospitals and reveal specific processes of care that can be improved upon to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant black/white disparities in neonatal mortality rates are partially explained by the fact that black mothers are more likely to deliver in higher mortaliy hospitals. Results from this study will explore why such wide variations in hospital neonatal mortality rates exist and why black moms deliver at higher mortality hospitals. Ultimately, our findings will direct future efforts to reduce racial disparities in neonatal outcomes.            ",Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths,8823453,R01HD078565,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mothers ', ' newborn mortality ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Nurseries ', ' Nurses ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' uptake ', ' Replacement Therapy ', ' very low birth weight infant human ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW (human) ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Knowledge ', ' neonatal demise ', ' neonatal death ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant death ', ' Performance ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' neonate ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' surfactant ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NICHD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,429732,0.042361455707270144
"Mi Puente: My Bridge to Better Cardiometabolic Health and Well-being ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals of low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics, the largest U.S. ethnic minority group, are disproportionately burdened by chronic cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (""cardiometabolic"" e.g., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). High levels of unmet behavioral health needs (e.g., related to mental health, life stressors, healthcare access) in this population contribute to the striking disparities in disease prevalence and outcomes. Differences in the quantity and quality of health care targeted to and received by members of the Hispanic population contribute to these disparities. Inequities in health care access and use result from the interaction of several factors, such as those related to low SES, and cultural, language, and/or communication-style differences. Our established academic-healthcare-community partnership has unique experience in developing and testing innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable chronic care interventions to reduce disparities and improve health in underserved communities. The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of Mi Puente (""My Bridge"") compared to Usual Care (UC; evidence-based, best practice discharge procedures) in 560 Hispanics adults, hospitalized with 2 or more cardiometabolic conditions and behavioral health concern(s) at a large safety net hospital near the US/Mexico border in San Diego, CA. Mi Puente is an interdisciplinary program that applies a sustainable nurse + volunteer team approach, and builds upon a strong collaborative partnership between inpatient/""referring"" and outpatient/""receiving"" care settings to improve continuity of care and address the integrated (i.e., physical and behavioral) health needs of at-risk Hispanics. Informed by the Social Ecological Model, Resources and Support for Self-Management Model, and Transtheoretical Model of behavior change, Mi Puente includes in-hospital coaching visit(s) from a Behavioral Health Nurse, and post-discharge supportive telephone calls from the nurse (week 1) and a specially-trained Volunteer Peer Mentor (weeks 1-4) that will assist patients in navigating the multi-level barriers that contribute to inequities in health care access and use, and in turn, perpetuate disparities in cardiometabolic and behavioral health. Electronic medical records (EMR) will be used to identify eligible patients and evaluate re-hospitalizations, our primary outcome, at 30- and 180-days. Changes in patient-reported physical symptoms, quality of life, healthcare utilization, patient activation, and support resources for chronic disease management will be evaluated across six months. Thorough process and cost- effectiveness analyses will evaluate the scalability and sustainability potential of Mi Puente. By capitalizing o existing hospital-based resources, and by addressing critical components of mind and body via an interdisciplinary, culturally-tailored, and sustainable intervention, Mi Puente aims to reduce health disparities in the growing and aging US Hispanic population, and holds promise for impactful expansion to other conditions and underserved populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will evaluate Mi Puente, an interdisciplinary program that applies a sustainable nurse + volunteer team approach to reduce hospitalizations, and improve functioning and quality of life, in Hispanics - an at-risk, understudied population tha experiences disparities in cardio metabolic disease prevalence and outcomes, and in behavioral health care access and use. These striking disparities in the growing and aging US Hispanic population have taxed the US healthcare system, while significantly reducing quantity and quality of life for millions of individuals. By offering a low-cost, scalable, and sustainable approach that capitalizes on existing hospital-based resources to improve the health and quality of life of Hispanics (and eventually, other at-risk, underserved groups), Mi Puente has strong potential to significantly impact public health.                ",Mi Puente: My Bridge to Better Cardiometabolic Health and

"Effect of Emergency Care Availability on Racial Disparities in Access & Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial differences in the burden of cardiovascular disease contribute significantly to health disparities observed in the United States. Timely access to emergency care is critical for diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF), yet access to emergency departments (EDs) varies substantially across communities. The deterioration of ED access, due to either ED closure or crowding (henceforth ""ED access block""), is associated with increased mortality rates. It has been posited that ED closures may improve acute care by removing poor-performers in a competitive market such that there is a tradeoff between distance traveled and quality of care. The risk of this assumption however, is that if ED closures occur mainly in minority communities, there could be differential effects on minority communities. We seek to fill this gap in the literature. Our long-term goal is to identify system-level mechanisms in emergency care delivery that contribute to disparities across various segments of the population. Our objectives are (1) to identify whether ED access block is a possible contributor to the widening of process and health outcome disparities between black and white patients with CHF and AMI; and (2) whether improved access (as a result of ED openings) may reduce disparities. We will link Medicare claims, hospital surveys, location data, and daily ambulance diversion logs from 2001 to 2010 to address the following Specific Aims (sample size is ~6 million admissions): Aim 1: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority patients relative to others within a community and whether ED openings can reduce those disparities. We hypothesize that ED access block results in a higher percentage of black patients being admitted to facilities with lower level technology, receiving inferior treatment, and experiencing worse patient outcomes as compared to white patients. Aim 2: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority-serving hospitals and whether ED openings can reduce disparities. We hypothesize that minority-serving hospitals are disproportionately burdened with a higher patient load and experience deteriorating quality relative to other facilities with the same level of ED access block. Aim 3: Determine whether ED access block disproportionately affects minority-heavy communities and whether ED openings can reduce disparities. We hypothesize that minority-heavy communities experience reduced technology access and quality relative to others when exposed to ED access block. Achieving these aims will offer an unusually complete picture of the potential mechanisms through which disparities can occur at patient-, facility-, and community-levels. Such mechanisms will inform policy makers whether certain measures are needed to improve efficiency of care and minimize disparities. Our framework can be applied broadly to investigate other types of disparities where ED access is critical. The objective of the research is to determine whether emergency department closures or crowding widens racial disparities in access and outcomes at patient-, facility-, and community-levels; and whether improved access as a result of ED opening can reduce such disparities. Health policies aiming to improve efficiency of care delivery can have unintended consequences of widening health disparities. Our results will offer an unusually complete picture of the potential mechanisms through which disparities can occur at different levels of care delivery, as well as inform policies with specific measures that may be applied to minimize disparities.",Effect of Emergency Care Availability on Racial Disparities in Access & Outcomes,8836582,R01HL114822,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Ambulances ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Policy Maker ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Hour ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Inferior ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Deterioration ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NHLBI,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R01,2015,299968,0.017016517725551048
"Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes. The organization and practice of nursing have substantial positive effects on patient care and patient  outcomes. As a result of our NINR-sponsored research program continually funded since 1997, organization-based nursing interventions are now more often considered as potential solutions to poor quality and unsafe care. Organizational factors include nurse education, via preferential hiring practices  and educational benefits to employees~ nurse staffing, an evolving ""industry standard"" that has been the  focus of legislation~ human resource policies which determine nursing skill mix~ and the nursing work  environment-the organizational practices fostering the autonomy and authority required for nurses to  translate their education and experience into effective nursing care. In large, multi-state surveys of US nurses conducted in 1999 and in 2006, we have applied innovative sampling, aggregation, and measurement methods to provide rich information on nursing never before available for large numbers of  healthcare organizations that is linked to patient outcomes to document the empirical relationship between  nursing and outcomes. These data have been used to answer a range of compelling practice and policy questions about the contributions of nurses to safe, effective care. This application is an efficient, innovative extension of our line of research creating a large study of the impact of change in nursing factors on outcomes, seeking to determine more about causality in order to spur implementation of recommendations emerging from research. We will replicate in 2014 measurements made in 2006 (and 1999 in Pennsylvania) across approximately 665 hospitals and hundreds of nursing homes and home care agencies in four large states with measurement before and after the national economic downturn and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The great strength of the application is that in creating a panel of organizational observations, we can see where change has occurred and why. Specific aims are to: 1)  Collect data from random samples of nurses in CA, FL, NJ, and PA~ 2) Examine organizational-level  changes over time in nurse inputs in (a) education, (b) staffing, (c) skill mix, and (d) work environment  between 1999, 2006, and 2014~ 3) Estimate the effects of organizational-level changes on outcomes for  patients including minorities and those with chronic illnesses and determine whether lesser improvement in  nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has widened the disparity in outcomes between white and  minority patients~ and 4) Determine the effects of nursing factors in nursing home and home health agency  patient outcomes while accounting for variation in patient clinical severity and complexity.  The overarching aim of the proposed study is to determine points of comparatively low-cost organizational leverage of nursing inputs to improve patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In studying health care organizations over time, we learn what kinds of changes in nursing resources have occurred and thus are possible, and the consequences of changes for quality of care and patient outcomes.

"PROMIS-Deaf Profile: Inclusion of Deaf Patients in Disability and Outcomes Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current patient-reported outcome measures are heavily dependent on English, which present serious language barriers to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) patients who use American Sign Language (ASL). The availability of patient-reported outcome measures in ASL and English and such that is valid for users of accessible technology and services will provide important insights on improving prevention and treatment models that will lead to better personal and public health within the underserved DHH population. The research plan builds on Dr. Kushalnagar's prior research on communication and quality of life outcomes with deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) population. Communication-related fatigue is relevant to healthcare outcomes. Specific aims include (1) describing the linguistic and internal validity of PROMIS-Deaf profile, (2) examining QoL domains across DHH sub-groups, and (3) evaluating the prevalence of communicative stress and risk factors for health status and generic QoL in a nationwide sample of early-deafened adults. The study will be conducted by a research team that includes: an early career investigator with expertise in quality of life outcomes in DHH population, a senior investigator with expertise in patient reported outcome measures (the creator of the FACIT fatigue QoL measure), a psychometrician with experience in conducting IRT and psychometric analyses for patient reported outcome measures, an audiologist with expertise in (re)habilitative audiology and hearing related outcomes, an ASL translation expert, and a biostatistician. The Advisory Committee consists of experts on the subject matter related to the project and who are nationally known for their work with DHH population. Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that may contribute to poor quality of life frequently observed for individuals with hearing loss. The goals of this application are consistent with the NIDCD 2012-2016 strategies related to improving outcomes for human communication and reducing health disparities, and expected findings will support the development of a future grant proposal for a randomized study that will assess the ability of PROMIS- Deaf profile to detect minimally important changes with intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROMIS-Deaf profile is a patient reported outcome measure that is accessible in American Sign Language and English.

"Unintended Consequences:  Medicare Performance Programs and Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the healthcare landscape has undergone transformational changes, through public reporting of hospital performance, promotion of medical homes, and development of global payment mechanisms, all directed at improved quality and value of care. To accelerate and solidify this process, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 mandated two programs of performance-based financial incentives covering a majority of hospitals nationwide: the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) and the Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program. Beginning in 2012, the programs incentivized an increase (""reward"") or decrease (""penalty"") in Medicare reimbursement rates based on hospital performance on a range of measures - readmissions, process of care, patient experience of care, mortality - some covering all patients and others covering patients with acute admissions for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia.  Although intended to encourage evaluation and improvement of quality-of-care processes, these programs have raised considerable concern for potential adverse impact in hospitals that care for disproportionately large share of racial and ethnic minorities (""minority-serving hospitals"") or uninsured and underinsured patients (""safety-net hospitals""). First, evidence indicates that patient outcomes, such as readmissions, are affected by factors beyond the influence of hospital processes, including access to outpatient care, and family and social supports; consequently, HRRP and VBP, using hospital benchmarks that make no allowance for differences in patient socio-demographic or clinical severity profiles, may lead to higher risk of penalties for minority-serving and safety-net hospitals. Second, as minority-serving and safety-net hospitals provide more uncompensated care, leading to greater reliance on public subsidies, their investments for quality-of-care improvements are likely to be smaller; to compound this challenge, financial penalties from the Medicare programs may have a greater adverse impact for patient care and outcomes in the resource-poor hospitals due to their low operating margins.  To evaluate these concerns, the proposed study aims to examine data from the implementation experience of these programs. Using Medicare patient-level and hospital-level data (2008-2015), and a difference-in-differences study design based on comparison of hospitals exposed to the programs with those not exposed, we aim to estimate program effects on (a) hospital performance, and (b) patient outcomes - 30- day mortality and readmission - by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. In addition, we will explore alternative modifications in performance programs to incentivize safety-net and minority-serving hospitals to improve quality of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 2012, as mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare began implementation of two programs - the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and the Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program - that reward/penalize hospitals based on performance on process of care, patient experience, and outcomes. This has raised concern for hospitals that serve a larger share of racial/ethnic minority and low income patients, due to the higher associated risk of poor patient outcomes and lower compensation for patient care. Using data on rewards and penalties following the implementation of the two programs, this study aims to measure the program impact (a) on the quality of care in minority-serving and safety-net hospitals, and (b) on patient outcomes by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.            ",Unintended Consequences:  Medicare Performance Programs and Health Disparities,9077010,R01MD010527,"['safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' financial incentive ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' family support ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' Affect ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Uncompensated Care ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient safety ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,592333,0.058959852674679215
"Bridges to the Bacclaureate Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) partnership between the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing (NHWSN) at Emory University and the Nursing Program at Georgia Perimeter College (GPC). The program focuses on identifying students from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups - groups who are underrepresented in nursing and nursing science as well - and supporting them through the associate degree to the baccalaureate in nursing (BSN) and on to careers in nursing science in the PhD program in Nursing at Emory or at similar research-intensive institutions. BttB aims to increase the number of underrepresented students who complete the AS degree in Nursing at GPC and enter the BSN program at NHWSN; who develop skills and knowledge in nursing science; and who are socialized into the culture and profession of nursing science and move forward to doctoral studies. BttB responds to national needs to address the nursing shortage by developing a next generation of nursing scientists to be faculty in schools of nursing who both teach and create the evidence for improved practice. It also addresses the IOM call for nursing leadership to work with other professions to develop innovative solutions to the nation's health care crisis and to the persistent problem of health disparities. The BttB program will consist of five elements; (1) recruitment and enrollment; (2) research exposure; (3) research immersion; (4) academic programming; and (5) mentoring, advising, and counseling. Faculty from both institutions will participate in selecting GPC students into the BttB program in their first semester in the GPC nursing program. Research roundtables and summer and school-year research immersion experiences will strengthen the environment of research at GPC and will enable students to learn about nursing science both conceptually and experientially. The roundtable and immersion experiences will continue when students transfer to NHWSN and enter an RN-BSN program that is specifically tailored to accommodate their prior training and to further immerse them in nursing science. At NHWSN, BttB students will be in an environment characterized by the active conduct of funded research by a large number of tenured and tenure track faculty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) program seeks to move underrepresented students from an associate degree in nursing (AS) program through a bachelor degree in nursing (BSN) program and to a point of readiness for doctoral training in nursing science.

"Profiles and Progress in Spanish English Bilinguals with Language Impairment: Development of a Criterion Reference Measure PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY We have made significant gains in the correct classification of Spanish-English bilinguals with language impairment though the identification of clinical markers of impairment. Yet a hurdle in reducing the health disparities associated with language impairment in bilingual populations is the need to establish developmental milestones that can serve as the foundation for goal setting and evaluation of progress as a function of language intervention. We know that experiential factors (age of acquisition and language use) interact with bilingual language outcomes. But we do not have a detailed picture of qualitative and quantitative differences between bilingual children with language impairment and their typically developing peers in the semantics and morphosyntax domains. The proposed project will translate the knowledge base regarding clinical markers of impairment, experiential factors, and knowledge of the linguistic systems of English and Spanish to the development of a clinical tool. The focus of the tool is to benchmark language learning in bilingual children growing up in the US context. Thus, the major aim of this project is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and set of probes in Spanish and English. These will be useful for intervention planning and to measure change as a function of language intervention. This tool will target 4-10 year old Spanish English bilinguals with and without language impairment. We will achieve this aim by 1) developing and evaluating an extension of our existing item set; 2) conducting an item tryout study to establish an item set for testing semantic and morphosyntactic performance profiles; and 3) field testing and validating a inventory and probes for profiling patterns of mastery in bilingual children with language impairment that is normed to account for age and language experience. To achieve these milestones, we will recruit 1200 bilingual children between the ages of 4 and 10 years of age from representative U.S. bilingual populations both in regard to dialect and SES. Using a modified matrix model, children will complete a battery of test items that tap key aspects of lexical-semantic and grammatical knowledge in English and Spanish. To make this tool maximally useful in clinical settings, we will program the task to be delivered by computer so that appropriate targets are selected based on the child's age and language experience and that sufficient targets are administered to accurately establish mastery and non-mastery. This research will form the foundation of a clinical tool that can be used by clinicians to establish goals and to document progress as a function of language intervention. This work will further our research in language impairment, especially with bilingual children, because we will document a broad profile of lexical semantic and morphosyntactic skills over a wider age range than is usually studied. The tools developed will also be useful for researchers who need to benchmark children's performance in developmental and intervention studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and probes of Spanish and English development for planning and measuring progress in language intervention. We will translate information about identifying language impairment in Spanish English bilinguals and the relationship between language experience and language growth to develop an item set for identifying patterns of mastery and non mastery of grammatical and lexical semantic targets in 4 to 10 year old bilinguals. This tool that will help clinicians develop and track progress in language invention. Researchers will benefit because it will allow them to benchmark development and test the outcomes of language interventions.",Profiles and Progress in Spanish English Bilinguals with Language Impairment: Development of a Criterion Reference Measure,9171199,R01DC015588,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Age Factors ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Computers ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' Semantics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Development Plans ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' kindergarten ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 10 year old ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' Impairment ', ' lexical ', ' English Learner ', ' English Language Learner ', ' invention ', ' Developmental Course ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2016,609976,0.05510729246450256
"Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent racial disparities in neonatal mortality rates are a major public health concern. Black neonates are more than twice as likely to die as white neonates. In previous research in New York City (NYC) hospitals, we found nearly a three-fold variation in risk-adjusted very low birth weight (VLBW) neonatal mortality rates among hospitals and black infants were much more likely to be born at higher mortality hospitals. The factors that influence wide variation in mortality rates among hospitals are not known. Why black women are more likely to deliver at higher mortality hospitals is also unknown. The objectives of this study are: 1) To examine risk- adjusted neonatal mortality among New York City hospitals over the past decade and assess the extent to which variations in hospital quality contribute to VLBW mortality disparities for blacks and Latinos; 2) To use an innovative mixed methods approach to explore processes of care, unit characteristics, patient factors, and organizational factors that explain differences in hospital quality as measured by overall and cause-specific risk-adjusted mortality rates and use of evidence-based practices; 3) To explore patients' perspectives on barriers to receipt of high quality care by exploring barriers to timely care, communication, availability of high risk obstetrics care, knowledge, decision-making regarding delivery hospital, and perception of risk; and 4) To create specific strategies with key stakeholders to promote uptake of best practices at hospitals caring for VLBW infants including patient-centered strategies to minimize barriers to receipt of high quality care. Methods: In Phase 1, we will use NYC Vital Statistics records linked with New York State Discharge Abstract Data to develop a risk-adjusted VLBW neonatal mortality model. We will use this model to rank hospitals based on risk-adjusted mortality. We will then examine the distribution of black, Latino, and white births among hospitals. In Phases 2 and 3 we will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to determine which hospital factors and practice patterns may explain the wide variation in mortality outcomes among hospitals and to explore why black mothers deliver in higher mortality hospitals. We will then convene leaders of obstetrics and neonatologists, hospital quality leaders, community leaders, NYC and State Departments of Health, and patients to discuss our results and explore interventions to improve care for VLBW infants. Information from this study will provide a better understanding of quality in neonatal care in hospitals and reveal specific processes of care that can be improved upon to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant black/white disparities in neonatal mortality rates are partially explained by the fact that black mothers are more likely to deliver in higher mortaliy hospitals. Results from this study will explore why such wide variations in hospital neonatal mortality rates exist and why black moms deliver at higher mortality hospitals. Ultimately, our findings will direct future efforts to reduce racial disparities in neonatal outcomes.",Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths,9042406,R01HD078565,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' newborn mortality ', ' newborn death ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Nurseries ', ' Nurses ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Knowledge ', ' neonatal demise ', ' neonatal death ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant death ', ' Performance ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' neonate ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' neonatal care ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' perinatal outcomes ', ' surfactant replacement therapy ', ' neonatal outcome ', ' black/white disparity ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' ']",NICHD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,451384,0.042361455707270144
"Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K-07 award for Dr. Lisa Diamond, a clinician-investigator in the Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The applicant's long-term career goal is to contribute to the policy recommendations needed to eliminate healthcare disparities for cancer patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). Her research is aimed at understanding how clinician non- English language proficiency influences quality of care and outcomes for cancer patients with LEP. The work described in this proposal represents the first evidence-based approach to inform guidelines for the care of cancer patients with LEP. Dr. Diamond's background in health services research, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, through the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program positions her well to accomplish this. Through the proposed career development activities she seeks to gain additional skills towards achieving independence as a scientific investigator with a program of training in large database analysis and its relationship to policy formation, dissemination and implementation research, and the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a widely used rigorous method of coding medical interactions. True language concordance occurs when clinicians are fluent in the language that their patient speaks and reduces disparities among LEP patients. Partial language concordance may adversely impact the quality of cancer care provided to LEP patients. The applicant's research agenda is to gather the evidence to inform national and local standards for the appropriate use of non-English language skills by clinicians. Without standards, LEP cancer patients have the potential to misunderstand diagnoses and treatment recommendations, leading to treatment non- adherence.  Dr. Diamond proposes to accomplish this through the three aims in this career development award. First, she will identify the content of any existing policies on clinician use of non-English language skills and interpreters at hospitals that frequently serve cancer patients and to determine the factors associated with having such a policy. This will be accomplished by surveying the NCI-designated Cancer Centers nationally, the NCI Community Oncology Research Program sites, and minority-serving hospitals in New York City (NYC). Second, she will test the feasibility of using the RIAS across different languages to describe the nature of communication between clinicians and LEP cancer patients presenting for an initial visit at three minority- serving hospitals in NYC. Third, she will assess the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency, non- English language use, and interpreter use on completion of cancer treatment, quality of life, depression, and stress among a population of LEP cancer patients at the same 3 hospitals participating in Aim 2. Through the proposed career development and research activities, the applicant seeks to acquire new skills and knowledge that will complement her existing research abilities in order to improve cancer care to patients with LEP.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since many clinicians who provide language concordant care are not native speakers of their patients' languages, studies are needed to help understand the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency on quality of cancer care for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). There are no national or state guide- lines to direct a clinician's decision to use his/her non-English language skills or a professional interpreter with LEP patients. It is critical to gather the evidence for standards addressing when it is acceptable to use one's own non-English language skills with LEP cancer patients and when professional interpreters are essential.            ",Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care,9044545,K07CA184037,"['Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Research Technics ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Diamond ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Competence ', ' Roter ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Nature ', ' English Language ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' skills ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K07,2016,180036,0.030384904507675333
"Mi Puente: My Bridge to Better Cardiometabolic Health and Well-being ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals of low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics, the largest U.S. ethnic minority group, are disproportionately burdened by chronic cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (""cardiometabolic"" e.g., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). High levels of unmet behavioral health needs (e.g., related to mental health, life stressors, healthcare access) in this population contribute to the striking disparities in disease prevalence and outcomes. Differences in the quantity and quality of health care targeted to and received by members of the Hispanic population contribute to these disparities. Inequities in health care access and use result from the interaction of several factors, such as those related to low SES, and cultural, language, and/or communication-style differences. Our established academic-healthcare-community partnership has unique experience in developing and testing innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable chronic care interventions to reduce disparities and improve health in underserved communities. The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of Mi Puente (""My Bridge"") compared to Usual Care (UC; evidence-based, best practice discharge procedures) in 560 Hispanics adults, hospitalized with 2 or more cardiometabolic conditions and behavioral health concern(s) at a large safety net hospital near the US/Mexico border in San Diego, CA. Mi Puente is an interdisciplinary program that applies a sustainable nurse + volunteer team approach, and builds upon a strong collaborative partnership between inpatient/""referring"" and outpatient/""receiving"" care settings to improve continuity of care and address the integrated (i.e., physical and behavioral) health needs of at-risk Hispanics. Informed by the Social Ecological Model, Resources and Support for Self-Management Model, and Transtheoretical Model of behavior change, Mi Puente includes in-hospital coaching visit(s) from a Behavioral Health Nurse, and post-discharge supportive telephone calls from the nurse (week 1) and a specially-trained Volunteer Peer Mentor (weeks 1-4) that will assist patients in navigating the multi-level barriers that contribute to inequities in health care access and use, and in turn, perpetuate disparities in cardiometabolic and behavioral health. Electronic medical records (EMR) will be used to identify eligible patients and evaluate re-hospitalizations, our primary outcome, at 30- and 180-days. Changes in patient-reported physical symptoms, quality of life, healthcare utilization, patient activation, and support resources for chronic disease management will be evaluated across six months. Thorough process and cost- effectiveness analyses will evaluate the scalability and sustainability potential of Mi Puente. By capitalizing o existing hospital-based resources, and by addressing critical components of mind and body via an interdisciplinary, culturally-tailored, and sustainable intervention, Mi Puente aims to reduce health disparities in the growing and aging US Hispanic population, and holds promise for impactful expansion to other conditions and underserved populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will evaluate Mi Puente, an interdisciplinary program that applies a sustainable nurse + volunteer team approach to reduce hospitalizations, and improve functioning and quality of life, in Hispanics - an at-risk, understudied population tha experiences disparities in cardio metabolic disease prevalence and outcomes, and in behavioral health care access and use. These striking disparities in the growing and aging US Hispanic population have taxed the US healthcare system, while significantly reducing quantity and quality of life for millions of individuals. By offering a low-cost, scalable, and sustainable approach that capitalizes on existing hospital-based resources to improve the health and quality of life of Hispanics (and eventually, other at-risk, underserved groups), Mi Puente has strong potential to significantly impact public health.                ",Mi Puente: My Bridge to Better Cardiometabolic Health and

"System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care  Over the past decade, the proportion of minority older adults residing in nursing homes (NHs) has increased dramatically and is projected to surpass that of white adults by 2030.1 NHs account for 68% of the $72 billion spent on long-term care in 2008 with most of it funded by Medicaid. These demographic and financial realities create an urgency to understand the needs of minorities in NHs and how systems organization and care delivery in NHs operate to ensure that minority residents maintain quality of life (QoL) and receive quality of care (QoC) equitable to white residents. QoL is a patient-centered measure that captures social, psychological, and environmental well-being. QoC typically consists of staff-reported indicators of care delivery and its related to clinical outcomes (e.g., pressure ulcers). Racial disparities exist in certain QoC indicators, and our recent work for the first time found racial disparities in NH resident QoL. However, those disparities were not based on individual race/ethnicity, but reflected system-wide factors affecting NHs that served more minority residents. Some of these factors are not amenable to intervention, including location of high-minority proportion NHs in poorer areas. There is a need to identify modifiable system-wide mechanisms for these disparities to craft interventions that address them.  Our long-term goal is to develop an intervention for improving QoL for minority NH residents nationwide. To build toward that goal, we designed a multi-method study to examine organizational structures and processes of care in NHs with high and low proportions of minorities, and then assess system-level predictors of NH QoL (primary outcome) and QoC (secondary outcomes) in a unique state-level database with more granular measures as well as a nationally-representative database. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1: Assess and compare, via qualitative methods, the structural, cultural, and process factors influencing QoL and QoC for minority residents among NHs with high, moderate, and low proportions of minority residents. Aim 2: Determine the effect of system-level factors on racial/ethnic differences in NH QoL(primary) and QoC (secondary outcome) using a unique statewide dataset. Aim 3: Using national data from all licensed NHs in the US, test the effect of system-level predictors on racial differences in QoL (primary) and QoC (secondary outcome). Narrative Despite the increase in use of nursing home services by racial/ethnic minority groups, we know little about the needs of minorities in these settings. This project will examine modifiable system- wide mechanisms for nursing home resident quality of care and quality of care for minority older adults. We will use a mixed-methods design with state and national data.  ",System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care,9154456,R01MD010729,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Communities ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2016,338859,0.016189992675890604
"Impacts of nursing home competition & state policies on disparities in quality DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Racial/ethnic minorities made up about 16 percent of the nursing home population in 2004. More recent data suggest that the number of minority nursing homes residents is increasing dramatically, while the number of white residents is declining. These new demographic changes raise concerns about whether nursing homes are able to serve appropriately the needs of patients with increasingly diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The quality of care delivered in nursing homes has been a longstanding issue plaguing the industry, and continues to be the focus of federal and state policies aimed at improving it. Extant evidence suggests that these policies, including strengthened state quality regulations, improved Medicaid reimbursements, and more recent efforts to foster market competition (e.g., the repeal of the Certificate of Need requirement; the national quality reporting), have improved nursing home quality and outcomes during the past decade. As the industry makes headway and improves quality in response to these policy and market trends, it is important to recognize that improvements in overall nursing home quality may not automatically benefit all subgroups of patients equally. Indeed, despite evidence of overall improvements, a large body of literature continues to document racial/ethnic disparities in nursing home quality. In particular, our recent work, published in the Journal of American Medical Association, has for the first time provided evidence that while pressure ulcer outcomes in nursing homes have improved for both non-Hispanic whites and minorities, the gap between these two groups of patients remained unchanged. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to answer two very important questions: 1) Does this phenomenon, of improvement in quality for all concomitant with a persistent gap between racial/ethnic groups, exist in other areas of known disparities for nursing home care? and 2) Can we identify specific policy and market characteristics that have been successful not only in improving quality but also in closing the racial and ethnic gap in quality? The proposed project will achieve these goals by investigating the longitudinal and cross sectional impact of each of three major types of nursing home quality drivers - state regulation of quality, Medicaid reimbursement, and market competition - on the racial/ethnic quality gap and its persistence. The information generated by this project will contribute to the knowledge regarding the ways with which major nursing home policies impact equity of care.

"Language Barriers and Post-Acute Outcomes in Home Care: A Mixed Methods Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immigrants comprise 13% of the US population and 25.2 million US residents are categorized as having limited English speaking skills, defined as the inability to understand healthcare communication in English. The number of limited English proficiency (LEP) individuals living in the US grew 80% between 1990 and 2010 and they represent 10% or more of the populations in the 13 most highly populous states. As a result, healthcare workers in the US are more likely than ever to regularly encounter LEP patients in their practice. Language barriers likely pose a particularly vexing problem for the complex care coordination processes that occur when patients transition from the hospital to home care, representing an understudied problem. We know that LEP status increases a patient's risk for readmission between 15 and 25% and that there are effective means for reducing these barriers, e.g. adequate interpreter services. Yet there is a critical gap in our understanding of how language barriers impact the transition to home healthcare and the personnel, patient, and organizational factors that might influence post-acute discharge outcomes in LEP patients. Our overall goal is to understand how language barriers impact 30-day rehospitalization and home healthcare resource utilization among LEP patients recently discharged from the hospital, with a secondary aim of understanding their impact on functional status. We will accomplish this goal by conducting a mixed methods study in partnership with The Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), which documents the language skills and abilities of its employees and patients thereby allowing us to identify linguistically concordant visits in its extensive database of over  million LEP patient visits coming from 86,000 clients, with four language groups (Spanish, Korean, Russian, Chinese). This unique but nationally representative dataset and the New York City location of the study offers an appropriate environment to study this problem. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the largest and most diverse study of the influence of language barriers on critical clinical patient outcomes in the US. Results from this study will have policy and research implications for the organization and management of care coordination for LEP patients. This study will complement existing initiatives at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality focused on improving patient-provider communication for LEP patient populations, reducing racial and ethnic health disparities, improving care for vulnerable populations, improving post-hospital discharge processes, and addressing patient safety across the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One fifth of households in the United States speak a language other than English at home. By examining the associations between patient-provider language concordance, interpreter use, and post-acute care outcomes in the home healthcare setting along with ascertaining the dynamics of systemic care coordination issues, we can ensure that patients with a language barrier do not have their health outcomes adversely affected after a hospitalization episode. This will be the largest study of the impact of the healthcare system on LEP patient outcomes, including re-hospitalization, with implications that will make a major impact on US health services.",Language Barriers and Post-Acute Outcomes in Home Care: A Mixed Methods Analysis,9110121,R01HS023593,[''],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,249565,0.06769545866144662
"Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: A model to improve primary care for Hispanics with diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: An Intervention to Improve Nursing Care for Hispanics with Diabetes ABSTRACT Language barriers in healthcare are recognized as a leading determinant of health disparities among Hispanics in the United States.1 Limited English proficiency (LEP) has also been linked to the soaring diabetes epidemic among Hispanics. For Hispanics, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is 1.5 times that of non- Hispanic whites.3 Hispanic patients who do not speak English at home are at greater risk of foregoing diabetes care and they are significantly less likely than non-Hispanics to adopt a special diet for diabetes control, to exercise regularly, and to receive a yearly eye examination.6, 3 Recent research suggests that language concordance (LC) between patients and primary care providers is an effective precondition that improves outcomes in the treatment of LEP patients with diabetes. Interventions to increase the number of LC nurse practitioners consist of educational programs that develop second language (L2) abilities for health care professionals. A review of extant literature on L2 training for health professionals revealed that the preponderance of programs and materials are directed at basic levels of proficiency and confined to limited types of clinical interactions. The view of he present research team is that these programs and materials are substantially geared towards acute care and reflect a mismatch between an LEP patient population with chronic illnesses and a health professional workforce trained in L2 for acute care functions. This mismatch, we contend, exacerbates the difficulties faced by LEP patients with diabetes in achieving successful self- management and the physical and emotional wellness that goes along with it. This proposal describes the design and evaluation of an innovative educational intervention for nurse practitioner students called Integrated Language Learning for Chronic Care (IL2L). It pursues an integrated development of L2 and communication skills that will facilitate productive interactions between Spanish-speaking nurse practitioners and LEP Hispanic patients with diabetes. A mixed-method study design will be used to examine the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of the intervention. At the patient level, we will employ an RCT to determine the impact IL2L on the physical health, mental health, and self-efficacy of patients with uncontrolled diabetes. At the student level, we will employ the Roter Interaction Analysis System to measure gains in Spanish language interaction skills pre and post intervention. At the program level, we will use language program evaluation methodologies to assess the acceptability of the intervention within a nurse practitioner training program in a leading College of Nursing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: An Intervention to Improve Nursing Care for Hispanics with Diabetes PROJECT NARRATIVE Language barriers continues to impede access to quality care for limited English proficient populations. Recent research has demonstrated that access to language concordant providers increases quality of care.

"Patient Safety in Nursing Homes: A Closer Look at Improvement Recent improvements in measures of patient safety in nursing homes look, at first glance, like a monumental policy success. The reported percent of nursing home residents suffering pressure sores, falls, and urinary tract infections decreased dramatically since the early 2000s, when policymakers began numerous initiatives focused on improving nursing home quality. However, skepticism has emerged as to whether the improved performance on patient safety measures truly reflects improvements in residents’ outcomes or, alternatively, simply reflects changes in documentation since the data for the patient safety measures are self-reported by nursing homes. Policymakers interested in improving outcomes and maximizing the usefulness of the patient safety measures share this skepticism, especially in cases where performance on patient safety measures is not matched by performance on other established measures of quality. Several recent New York Times articles drew national attention to the issue, highlighting several cases where consumers felt misled by high quality ratings into choosing nursing homes that fell far short of expectations. Whether reported improvements in patient safety reflect true improvements in nursing home resident outcomes has particular import for disparities in the quality of nursing home care. It is well known that nursing homes with a high proportion of Medicaid residents, often located in poor neighborhoods and disproportionately serving members of racial and ethnic minority groups, provide lower quality of care on average. Although high- Medicaid nursing homes had notable improvements in many patient safety measures over the past two decades, if this performance does not reflect resident well-being and outcomes, these scores may mask the need for real quality improvement and do little to address disparities in nursing home care. Our overall objective in this mixed-methods study is to assess whether and how nursing homes are improving patient safety, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence as to how high-performing and high- improving nursing homes achieve these scores. By correlating this performance with other well-established measures of quality and potential mechanisms for improvement, we will gain insight as to whether these improvements are meaningful and whether they are equitably distributed. To address the first three Aims, we propose econometric analysis of multiple merged data sets for 2011-2014. The fourth Aim will entail primary qualitative data collection through interviews and observation of nursing homes. Our results will directly inform 1) how consumers should interpret nursing home performance on patient safety measures; 2) how policymakers might refine the measures and identify nursing homes in which performance on the measures may be less reliable; and 3) best practices for meaningful improvement. Narrative: Our overall goal in this study is to improve patient safety in nursing homes by taking a closer look at what it means for nursing homes to improve on reported patient safety measures. Our analyses will aid in interpretation and refinement of measures and identify best practices. Nursing home residents are a particularly vulnerable population responsible for disproportionate health care spending and utilization; thus the health outcomes of this population are of key policy concern.",Patient Safety in Nursing Homes: A Closer Look at Improvement,9219412,R01HS024967,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,421467,0.05851500048723229
"Defining a National Cohort of Assisted Living Residents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the over 710,000 older adults residing daily in the 22,000+ assisted living (AL) facilities in the US. This is primarily due to our inability to identify AL residents with secondary data as we have for beneficiaries receiving services in nursing homes (NHs). The long-term goal of this research agenda is to study the changing landscape of long-term care (LTC) and to understand the role of AL in providing quality care to our nation's most at-risk elders in much the same manner previously done with NHs. Critical impediments to this goal is the lack of a national dataset of ALs, a methodology to identify and track AL residents' LTC trajectories, and an understanding of how changes in the AL market affects other LTC sectors. To address this problem, our main goals of this application include the collection of an updated national census of AL providers to validate a methodology for identifying AL residents using secondary data sources. The rationale that underlies this proposed re`	search is that a national dataset of AL providers, a validated method to identify AL residents, and an understanding of the effect of the growth in the national AL market will, for the first time, allow researchers to investigate in more detail the national landscape of AL utilization and resident outcomes. The specific aims include: 1) To compile, geocode, match to other LTC data, and make publicly available a 2013 national dataset of AL providers on LTCfocUS.org, 2) To test the validity of a methodology for identifying AL residents against samples of Medicare beneficiaries receiving healthcare services within an AL and 3) To evaluate the effect of changes in the geographic supply of AL beds between 2007 and 2013 on the private-pay NH market. Our research is innovative because we will be the first to supply a national dataset of ALs and we put forward a new and unique approach to identify AL residents, namely the use of the 9-digit ZIP code reported in Medicare enrollment records, which we will validate by combining Home Health assessment data and Medicare Part B Place of Service Codes. In addition, we will improve our ability to identify the relationship of changing AL supply with the market for NH care by creating an innovative measure that captures the number of private-pay resident days in NHs on a national scale. Consequently, a better understanding of the effect of the changing AL market on NH private-pay occupancy and length of stay is expected to result. This work is significant because as more private, State, and Federal dollars are spent on AL, identifying users of these services, tracking their healthcare utilization and outcomes, and understanding the impact on other LTC market sectors becomes crucial. In addition, findings from this research have the strong potential for providing us the fist step in a continuum of research to be proposed in an R01 grant application following the completion of this work that is expected to elucidate provider quality, AL resident outcomes (e.g. hospitalization and NH placement), racial and ethnic disparities, and healthcare costs associated with this large, growing site of LTC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to NIA's mission because in order to understand the role of assisted living (AL) in providing quality long-term care (LTC), we need to be able to identify AL facilities, the residents within these facilities, and the impactit has on other sectors of LTC. This work will provide the necessary stepping stone for future research aimed at informing researchers and policymakers how to administer and finance LTC in ways that ultimately result in optimum improvements in the health and well-being of older people needing LTC.",Defining a National Cohort of Assisted Living Residents,8994700,R21AG047303,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Beds ', ' Censuses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economic Models ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Medicare Part B ', ' SMI Program ', ' Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance Program ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Residential Care Institutions ', ' residential care facility ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Licensing ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' rapid growth ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,203125,-0.013619888867169395
"Organizational Determinants of ICU Telemedicine Effectiveness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment in an ICU staffed by appropriately trained intensivist clinicians improves survival in critically ill patients. Yet many patients lack access o this level of critical care, particularly in small hospital and rural geographic areas, leading to excess mortality and creating significant socioeconomic disparities. To address this problem many hospitals have adopted ICU telemedicine, a health care delivery innovation which uses audio---visual technology to provide critical care services from a distance. By expanding access to high-quality critical care, ICU telemedicine has great potential to improve survival in critical illness. However, the success of telemedicine is hindered by critical deficiencies in our understanding of how and where this technology is best applied. Telemedicine is a complex intervention, and existing programs vary significantly in both the components of intervention and the clinical setting in which it is used. In turn, studies of telemedicine demonstrate mixed result, with some showing a large mortality benefit and others showing no benefit or even suggesting harm. As a result, decision makers have little guidance regarding how and where to use this potentially transformative technology, if at all. In this project we will address this knowledge ga by identifying the key clinical and organizational factors associated with ICU telemedicine effectiveness. Our central hypothesis is that objective, measurable, clinical and organizational factors will distinguish effective programs from ineffective ones. First, we will use national data on Medicare beneficiaries and an innovative risk--- adjustment procedure to quantify hospital---level variation in the impact of ICU telemedicine on patient mortality, ranking each hospital that has adopted ICU telemedicine from most effective to least effective. Second, we will conduct site visits at five hospitals with the greatest telemedicine effect and five hospitals with least telemedicine effect; along with two site visits at hospitals that have stopped using ICU telemedicine; performing in-depth qualitative analyses to identify the clinical and organizational factors associated with ICU telemedicine effectiveness. Third, we will develop and field a survey of all US hospitals that have adopted ICU telemedicine, linking the survey back to patient---level outcomes data and quantitatively defining ICU telemedicine clinical and organizational ""best practices"". By shifting the paradigm of ICU telemedicine evaluation away from whether it works to how and where it works best, this project will be the first rigorous examination of the factors that define successful ICU telemedicine implementation. Ultimately, these results will provide clinicians, hospital administrators with immediate, actionable data about how to use ICU telemedicine most effectively and efficiently, directly leading to improved access to critical care and improved survival for critically ill patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Between 4 and 7 million patients are admitted to an intensive care unit in the United States each year, and one---fifth of all Americans will die during a hospitalization that involves intensive care.

This NETT is jointly led by experienced clinical trialists well-versed in complex multi-center administrative structure and projects with established mentoring programs and a growing cadre of acute neurology subspecialists. Our NETT includes a combined annual ED volume of over 350,000 visits, with over 3,500 neurological emergencies. Strengths include the extremely diverse, large patient pool, extensive NIH clinical trials experience, detailed ED visit data from all hospitals, acute telemedicine experience, expertise in exemption from informed consent, and well-established, extensive community networks and engagement. Neurological Emergencies are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and are extremely costly illnesses. There is a great need to develop proven treatments for these conditions. There is also a disproportionate risk and burden on underrepresented minorities (URM) for many types of neurological emergencies which our NETT Clinical Hub Site and Spokes has been focusing on for recruitment.

"The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality of treatment for cancer-associated complications, those complications directly attributable to the cancer itself or that result from chemotherapy and/or radiation, have received little attention. This is particularly problematic as cancer-associated complications are associated with significant morbidity, are often accompanied by pain and discomfort, and require the expenditure of substantial healthcare resources for treatment. The management of cancer-associated complications is compounded by the availability of a myriad of treatment options, many of which are unproven and associated with significant cost. Little is known about the factors that influence allocation of care for thes complications and what factors influence outcome. The health care a patient receives and its associated outcomes are influenced by the interplay of a number of patient, physician, and hospital factors. For acute inpatient medical conditions the characteristics of the hospital in which a patient is treated play a crucial role. There is growing recognition that there is widespread between-hospital variation in how care is allocated and that these differences in practice patterns explain a large portion of treatment variability. Uninsured and minority patients are particularly vulnerable to these hospital level disparities as these patients are disproportionately more likely to receive care at facilities with limited clinical and financial resources that may adversely affect quality. In this proposal we will determine the quality of treatment for hospitalized patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of: febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia of malignancy, esophagitis, and acute cancer-associated pain. For each cancer-associated complication we will determine patterns of treatment, the factors that underlie treatment decisions, and the effect of prompt initiation of guideline-based therapy on outcomes. For each condition we will first examine the utilization of guideline-based and non-indicated treatments. We will then comprehensively examine the influence of patient, physician, and hospital characteristics as well as between- hospital variations on the allocation of guideline-based care. We hypothesize that there is substantial variation in treatment between hospitals that is unexplained by traditional measures. Finally, we will perform novel causal inference and mediation analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects operating through a mediator of prompt guideline-based treatment on outcomes (length of stay, readmission, cost, non-routine discharge and mortality) for each complication. In addition to including a number of novel statistical methodologies, this proposal will utilize a unique database ideally suited to the study of these complications. The data from these studies will lead to immediately actionable results that can be used to guide the implementation pragmatic hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To date, the complications that result either directly from cancer or from its treatment have received almost no attention. Our findings will provide important data on the management of these complications to patients, providers, and payers that are immediately actionable and can guide the development of targeted hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications.",The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp,8976833,R01CA169121,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Expenditure ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neutropenia ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Consensus ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' novel ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Treatment-Associated Cancer ', ' Therapy-Related Cancer ', ' Therapy-Associated Cancers ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Tumor ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Iatrogenic Cancer ', ' Treatment-Related Cancer ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' chemotherapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' high risk ', ' common treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,444358,-0.01548694870834524
"Comparative effectiveness of home care environments for diverse elders' outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a community/public health nurse and gerontological health services researcher committed to comparative effectiveness research on home health delivery systems. Her short-term training objectives are (1) to develop comparative effectiveness research methods expertise and (2) data management  and analytic methods specific to home health care datasets and research design issues. Long term research goals are to improve the design and deliver of home health nursing care outcomes for a rapidly aging and increasingly diverse population. In addition to focused research, career development plans include interaction with colleagues on her mentoring/research team, formal course work will be taken in comparative effectiveness research methods. The University of Pennsylvania will provide an outstanding environment for her career development. Resources include access to eminent interdisciplinary faculty who collaborate through focused   Research Centers in Health Services Research, Aging and Comparative Effectiveness Research, across the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Sociology, Statistics, and Business. Guided by excellent mentors, in a superb  training environment, with access to rich datasets and strong preliminary data, this proposal addresses three  specific aims: 1) Compare the effectiveness of nursing delivery system strategies (more nurses educated at  the baccalaureate level, ""front-loading"" of nursing visits, and supportive agency work environments) to improve  home health patient outcomes~ 2) Determine if and under what conditions the impact of nursing on home  health outcomes is contingent upon informal caregiver assistance~ and 3) Determine the extent of racial/ethnic  disparities in home health outcomes, and determine which nursing system delivery strategies are most likely to  be associated with improved outcomes for racial/ethnic minority patients and clinically complex older adults.  The proposed training and research will utilize the latest advances in comparative effectiveness  research methods to detect racial/ethnic disparities in home health outcomes, understand the contributing  factors (individual, family, community and health systems), and evaluate the comparative effectiveness of   nursing delivery system strategies on improving outcomes for home health patients under different individual  and socio-environmental circumstances. This innovative project will capitalize on a unique data set, comprised of nurse surveys providing detailed information about nursing care and work environment within home health agencies in nearly 250 home health agencies that serve older adults living in diverse communities. The nurse survey results combined with independent home health care patient assessment and outcomes data provides a window into each patient's unique circumstances, including the complexity and severity of their health status and care needs, as well as information about their living environment and informal caregivers. Linkages with additional administrative and public datasets will provide additional key variables regarding home health agency service patterns and community measures of crime, segregation, socio-economic status and health care provider availability/shortages. The proposed research is significant because it will highlight the value of different home health nursing delivery strategie for improving patient outcomes among vulnerable populations may be achieved. The challenge being addressed--how to best provide safe, effective, and affordable home  health nursing care to diverse patients--affects patient outcomes across the continuum of care from home to  medical home and hospital. Limited evidence is available to guide home health care systems administrators in making decisions about the pros and cons of home health nursing delivery system strategies. The best combination of home health nursing care delivery strategies may be categorically different depending on the presence of informal family caregivers and community supports. Professional home health nursing care and informal (lay) or community care may interact synergistically to increase the effectiveness of systems level intervention, for example, by reducing the intensity of services needed. The comparative effectiveness study proposed will form a critical body of evidence needed to translate effective nursing delivery system strategies into evidence-based practice recommendations that providers, payers, purchasers, policy makers, other principle investigators, and the public can trust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine the relationships among nursing care delivery, the availability of informal caregivers, and patients' race and ethnicity on the health outcomes of older adults. Understanding the reasons for differences in outcomes may lead to improved ways to care for older adults living in the community.",Comparative effectiveness of home care environments for diverse elders' outcomes,9245273,R00HS022406,[''],AHRQ,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R00,2016,249000,0.04213652346329152
"Racial disparities in hospital use and quality of care for coronary heart disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research suggests that racial disparities in heart disease treatment are due in part to differences in the quality of hospitals used by white and black patients. One possible explanation is that blacks live in neighborhoods with worse hospitals. However, recent studies have found that blacks are also more likely than whites to travel beyond reputable, high quality hospitals, especially for non-urgent specialized treatments, even when they live close to these facilities. Thus, factors other than location may play a role in how blacks and whites use high and low quality hospitals. We assume that, even after accounting for location, black patients are more likely to use lower quality hospital and hospitals that are located in majority black neighborhoods or have a sizable black clientele. This may be the consequence of differences in physician referrals or patient distrust of predominantly white institutions, and is likely to result in higher rates of bypass of high-quality hospitals among blacks. We further assume that the racial differences in how blacks and whites use high and low quality hospitals are more pronounced in metro areas with high residential segregation and in neighborhoods with high social disadvantage. The proposed research will focus on three cardiac conditions with various degrees of acuity - acute myocardial infarction, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery - and will use several national data sources, including Medicare files to identify patients and hospitals they use; American Hospital Association surveys for hospital characteristics; and the US Census to obtain zip code and metro area demographics and segregation measures. Analyses will employ state-of-the-art methods developed specifically for the study of hospital choice. The study will enhance our understanding of causal pathways in health care disparities by answering important questions related to factors contributing to racial differences in hospital care for the treatment of heart disease. Does geography play a role in black and white seniors' access to high quality hospitals? Is a hospital's neighborhood racial composition particularly salient to black seniors? Are these effects modified by the degree of metro area residential segregation? What is the contribution of differences in geographic access, and of differences in how black and white seniors choose hospitals, to the segregation of health care quality? The proposed study will address these and many more questions. Further, by quantifying the relative roles of geography and hospital choice behavior, the study will provide valuable information to local policy makers aiming to reduce disparities in their respective metro areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will evaluate the role of geographic and social context factors in how black and white seniors choose hospitals for the treatment of heart disease. The study is relevant to public health and policy makers by 1) identifying areas with poor geographic access to high-quality hospitals that could be targeted for quality improvement; and 2) enhancing our understanding of how hospital, neighborhood, and metro area factors affect the use of high and low quality hospitals and, more generally, the segregation of health care delivery. Enhanced understanding will enable us to design completely new interventions targeted at, for example, improving relationships and trust between communities and health care institutions.",Racial disparities in hospital use and quality of care for coronary heart disease,8988290,R01HL118410,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Communities ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hospitals ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' reperfusion ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Travel ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Angioplasty ', ' intraluminal angioplasty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' member ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' Bypass ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' Cardiac ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' study population ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,345110,0.03200735332180106
"A Data-driven Approach to Improve Nursing Workflow and Patient-centered Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care recognizes patients' desires, opinions, and preferences as equal in importance to those of healthcare professionals, and emphasizes the need to educate and empower patients to play an active role in their care. The achievement of patient-centered care is associated with increased patient and provider satisfaction, improved health outcomes, and reduced cost of care delivery (Caffarini, 2011; Silow-Carol et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2008). Furthermore, as health disparities continue to persist, patient-centered care offers underserved patients the individualized and tailored care necessary to attain positive health outcomes. As the providers who spend more time with patients than any other personnel, nursing staff are central to the provision of patient-centered care (De Lucia et al., 2009). However, most of these front-line providers are burdened by numerous non-value added tasks that not only distract from direct patient care activities, but also hamper their ability to implement best practices such as proven care plans for preventing adverse events (e.g., falls and pressure ulcers) among at-risk patients (Hendrich et al., 2008; Storfjell et al., 2008; Aiken et al., 2002). The occurrence of such preventable events is especially concerning in light of the fact that such events fall disproportionately on already underserved populations, including certain racial/ethnic communities, limited English speaking individuals, and the elderly (Divi et al., 2007; Metersky et al., 2011; Rothschild et al., 2000). Fr patient-centered care to be truly realized, the healthcare system must introduce process innovations that can streamline mundane, indirect tasks such as service documentation for front-line nursing care providers and enable them to efficiently adopt value added clinical practices that benefit direct patient care activities. In this project, we will engage several partners-including a skilled nursing facility that serves predominantly monolingual Spanish- and Chinese-speaking communities and a long-term care facility for retired veterans-to implement an advanced patient-nurse communication and nurse workflow optimization system. This solution will: (i) track comprehensive care plans and associated tasks for individual patients; (ii intelligently assign and alert each provider of his or her care plan tasks, escalating pending tasks to appropriate staff members to expedite completion; and (iii) offer real-time analysis of task fulfillment status and workflow patterns, providing decision support to both staff and managers for identifying factors that may undermine staff productivity or contribute to adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patient-centered care is associated with increased quality and satisfaction with health services, and has significant potential to improve health outcomes for communities that experience health disparities; however, numerous indirect and often burdensome tasks hinder most nurses from delivering truly patient-centered care. To increase time available for direct bedside patient interactions, this project will develop a patient-nurse communication and workflow optimization tool specifically for streamlining nursing care protocols. By offering nurses full visibility of their workload, efficient interactive checklists fr carrying out upcoming tasks, and low- burden documentation capabilities from virtually any location in the unit, this innovative system will empower nurses to reduce time spent on low-value, indirect care tasks and be better able to account for individual patients' communication needs, thereby transforming the care environment to support patient-centered care delivery and sustained improvement in patient outcomes.",A Data-driven Approach to Improve Nursing Workflow and Patient-centered Care,9142998,R44MD009581,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Video Display Terminals ', ' Computer Terminals ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"UCLA/CDU Partnership for Enhancing Diversity of Nurses with Research Careers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities for individuals from under-represented minority groups (URMGs) continue to plague the US population. The roots of this problem are many and complex, but of great relevance is the dearth of individuals from URMGs in the health professions workforce, with serious disparities in the ethnic/racial composition of the workforce being particularly pronounced in nursing. The 2008 NSSRN survey showed 32.1% of Black/African American nurses and 39.4% of Latino nurses had baccalaureate degrees; for all racial/ethnic groups combined, only 11.4% had graduate degrees including PhDs. This state exists at a time when the US population is becoming older and more ethnically diverse. Given this dire state of affairs, we are proposing to enhance an existing relationship between the Schools of Nursing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU), an Historically Black Graduate Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution, for the purpose developing and implementing an integrated plan of individual and institutional activities to prepare masters students from URMGs to make a seamless transition to doctoral education. The long term goal of this project is to increase the ethnic/racial diversity of those prepared to pursue research careers in nursing focusing on research about aging adults (45+ years) by (1) increasing involvement of master's students and faculty at CDU SON in the scientific enterprise through structured development activities; (2) enriching the research course offerings and scientific environment at CDU SON to prepare master's students to seamlessly transition to doctoral education; and (3) facilitating student advancement to the UCLA SON via systems that facilitate student enrollment and scientific exchange between faculty at UCLA and CDU. Health disparities persist despite efforts to curb them. Encouraging more diverse, underrepresented minority individuals to pursue doctoral education in the health care field, such as nursing, is one documented way to reduce health disparities. This application proposes collaboration between University of California Los Angeles and Charles Drew University to provide the supportive and educational activities required to prepare a more diverse nursing workforce at the doctoral level, who will ask the relevant research questions and develop the science that will ultimately reduce health disparities.",UCLA/CDU Partnership for Enhancing Diversity of Nurses with Research Careers,9125846,R25GM102777,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' California ', ' Censuses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Health Occupations ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' R.N.

"EMT en Espanol: Caregiver-Implemented Language Intervention for Young Spanish-Speaking Children This R21 application proposes to develop and test an adaptation of Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT), a naturalistic evidence-based caregiver-implemented communication intervention for young children with language impairment. The culturally and linguistically adapted intervention, EMT en Español, addresses a critical need for evidence-based communication interventions for an underserved population, Spanish-speaking children and their families from low-income households. Spanish-speaking caregivers who have children ages 30 to 42 months evidencing receptive and expressive language delays will be eligible. Caregiver-implemented intervention to support the development of home language is recommended for young children with language impairments; however, there are currently no evidence-based, culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions teaching Spanish-speaking caregivers language support strategies for very young children with significant language delays. The proposed project includes: (a) conducting a randomized trial of EMT en Español, a 4-month home-based intervention, with 40 caregivers and their children with language delays; (b) examination of caregiver use of EMT en Español strategies (responsiveness, matched turns, target talk, expansions, prompting) before intervention, after intervention and 3 months after intervention (c) exploring the impact of intervention on child expressive and receptive vocabulary post-intervention and at the 3 month follow up; and (d) assessing the acceptability, perceived effectiveness, and cultural appropriateness of the intervention. The development of assessment protocols, intervention materials, and caregiver training procedures, together with data on parent and child outcomes from the RTC and the feasibility evaluation will provide the basis for a subsequent, large scale randomized control trial to examine the impact of caregiver-implemented home language intervention on critical long term outcomes including vocabulary, complex syntax, and reading in both Spanish and English for young children with language impairment. This intervention development project addresses the NIH goal of reducing disparities in access to health promoting interventions as well as the NIH research agenda to address the health needs of racial and ethnic minorities, rural and urban poor, in order to improve access to care for underserved populations.   The proposed project tests the effect of a caregiver-implemented language intervention designed for Spanish- speaking caregivers and their 30-42 month old children from low-income households. Spanish-speaking immigrant families represent a rapidly growing and vulnerable population with limited access to intervention services when their children present with language delays early on, thus, children are likely to have continued difficulties and are at risk for academic failure. This intervention has the potential to reduce disparities in early intervention services for this ethnic and linguistic minority population.",EMT en Espanol: Caregiver-Implemented Language Intervention for Young Spanish-Speaking Children,9227014,R21DC015850,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Age ', ' Belief ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Language ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Household ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Reading ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Rural ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' English Language ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' caregiver training ', ' care giver training ', ' care giver instruction ', ' care giver education ', ' Caregiver instruction ', ' caregiver education ', ' Improve Access ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' service intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trial design ', ' hands-on learning ', ' interactive learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' applied learning ', ' language impairment ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,235500,0.04747105171164693
"Quality of Early Mother-Child Communication and Language Outcome in Low-Income Hispanic Children Project Abstract Academic trajectories are established early, and children who enter school without the requisite readiness skills are at greatest risk for academic failure. Although language ability in early childhood is one of the strongest predictors of school readiness, many low-income children are markedly delayed in language ability. Dubbed the 30-million word gap, Hart and Risley (1995) demonstrated that children living in poverty hear substantially fewer words than their more affluent peers, and these findings have spurred national initiatives designed to increase the quantity of language input to young low-income children to establish positive early learning trajectories. However, exciting new research suggests these well-intentioned interventions may not have their desired impact if they do not also increase the quality of the communication foundation supporting language learning during early caregiver-child interactions. Hispanic children in Spanish-speaking and low income households are at significant risk for language delays and early academic failure, but there is little research regarding how to best support their language development and academic success. Our new findings regarding the importance of the quality of the communication foundation in the earliest years highlight how nonverbal and verbal qualities of parent-child interactions support the development of language skill and pave the way for developing optimal interventions. Spanish-speaking children are an important target for such interventions. An important preliminary step towards this goal, however, is to replicate this compelling research conducted with non-Hispanic African American and European American children with Spanish-speaking children. Building upon an existing study in Dallas that includes a large number of Mexican-origin Spanish- speaking families, we are uniquely positioned to address the following three aims: Aim 1. To refine the measurement methods for assessing the quality of the communication foundation so that they encompass culturally distinct patterns of parent-child interaction among Spanish- speaking Mexican-American families. Aim 2. To examine the relation between the quality of the early communication foundation and subsequent child language development among young Spanish-speaking Mexican-American children. Aim 3. To examine the relation between the quality of the early communication foundation and academic achievement in kindergarten and first grade among young Spanish-speaking Mexican- American children and whether it is mediated by early language development. Methods will include a comprehensive review and systematic modification of the existing rating protocol to capture those aspects of the early communication foundation among low-income Spanish-speaking mothers and their children. This revised rating system will be applied to existing data for a longitudinal cohort of low- income Mexican-American children selected from the Dallas Preschool Readiness Study (DPReP). Multivariate regression methods will be used to examine relations between the communication foundation assessed at age 2½ with language and school readiness outcomes at ages 3½ and kindergarten. Project Narrative Hispanic children in Spanish-speaking and low income households are at heightened risk for language delays and early academic failure. In this study, we will use video-recorded data from an established study to refine a rating system to capture characteristics of the quality of the early communication foundation among low- income Spanish-speaking mothers and their 2½ year old children. Data captured using this refined rating system will be used to examine relations between the quality of the communication foundation and later child language development and school readiness using data already being collected as part of the parent longitudinal study.",Quality of Early Mother-Child Communication and Language Outcome in Low-Income Hispanic Children,9172906,R01HD086832,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Child Language ', ' Communication ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Household ', ' Intelligence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' mother child interaction ', ' Mother-Child Relationship ', ' Mother-Child Relations ', ' Mothers ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' County ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Rituals ', ' Ritual compulsion ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Life ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' 1st grade ', ' first grade ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' kindergarten ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' systematic review ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2016,334554,0.03922508838472152
"Impacts of payment reform on racial disparities in hospital psychiatric care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In July 2014, Maryland implemented a statewide hospital payment reform that includes global capitated budgeting to increase efficiency and performance incentives to improve quality. By encouraging hospitals to address the unmet needs of minority patients, this sweeping change has the potential to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in care coordination for individuals who are hospitalized as a result of a mental healt condition. However, such payment reforms, if not carefully designed, could incentivize ""safety-net"" hospitals, which provide access to psychiatric care in low-income minority urban communities, to offer fewer psychiatric services in order to reduce costs. In this study, hospitals administrative data are used in a non-experimental difference-in-difference-in-differences regression framework to examine the effects of the Maryland payment reform on racial-ethnic disparities in hospital-based psychiatric care at safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals. The study's primary outcomes are receipt of outpatient follow-up and transitional care management services after a psychiatric inpatient stay, hospital readmission, and hospital spending per patient for psychiatric services. These impacts are identified by comparing changes in Maryland (the intervention state) with changes in Pennsylvania (the comparison state) after, versus before, July 2014. This proposed study is significant and timely because it can inform policymakers' assessments of how similar ""value- based"" hospital payment reforms in other states can be designed to improve care for minority patients while preserving the psychiatric care safety-net in low-income minority communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although ""value-based"" health care payment reforms might reduce racial-ethnic disparities in health care coordination for individuals receiving psychiatric inpatient care, such payment reforms, if not carefully designed, could instead result in reduced access to psychiatric care services in predominantly low-income minority communities. This study can inform policymakers' assessments of how to design value-based payment reforms in order to reduce disparities in psychiatric care while preserving the psychiatric care safety-net in low-income minority communities.",Impacts of payment reform on racial disparities in hospital psychiatric care,9120420,R01MD010255,"['Affect ', ' Budgets ', ' Communities ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' mental health facility ', ' Mental Institutions ', ' Mental Hospitals ', ' Psychiatric Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Maryland ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Capitate ', ' capitate bone ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Services ', ' hospital utilization ', ' Performance ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' payment ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Hospital safety ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' service utilization ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' primary outcome ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2016,493067,0.029878515398999807
"Hispanic Role Models in Health Care Careers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers:  Empowering Hispanic Nurses to Leverage Traditional Spanish language and New Social Media to Inspire the Next Generation of Culturally Diverse  and Competent Health Care Professionals The National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN), in association with the Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), proposes to address the shortage of bilingual professionals in all health fields by recruiting and interviewing bilingual role models and arranging to broadcast those interviews nationwide. Leveraging HCN's nationally broadcast health education radio shows, whose cumulative audiences are larger than NPR's ""All Things Considered,"" this project has the potential to reach one out of every three US Hispanics during its first five years. This media campaign is intended to inspire Hispanic parents to encourage their children to study science and aspire to careers in the biomedical professions. It is also intended to inspire and empower Spanish-speaking adults from all walks of life to consider careers in the health professions. All broadcasts will tie to NAHN's interactive website so that students and adults interested in changing careers can find mentors and educational resources.         NAHN will also use YouTube, Facebook, mobile phone applications, and other new and popular social media technologies to reach a broad cross-section of English speaking youth and young adults.         In addition to the national media outputs, attendees at NAHN's annual conferences will have the opportunity to receive training in public speaking and media relations so they can more effectively use local media in their own communities to address health disparities and promote careers in the biomedical and health professions.         NAHN will develop a standardized, bilingual Toolkit for public presentations. The Toolkit will include a Powerpoint presentation embedded with video containing gender- and other- stereotype-busting role model interviews with Hispanic nurses; links to an online database of volunteer mentors; and a bilingual terminology packet that will aid nurses in creating linguistic and cognitive bridges between audience and professional knowledge bases. We expect that the refined Toolkit will empower nurses and other health professionals to become more effective public health educators and career role models during their presentations at community health events, career fairs, achievement clubs, and school assemblies.        An Advisory Committee of other health organizations, professionals, and advocates will recommend Role Models and provide periodic feedback.         Bilingual independent evaluators associated with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health will conduct qualitative and quantitative formative, iterative, and summative evaluations throughout the project. Their recommendations and findings will be incorporated into the project design and deliverables and shared with relevant fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers, a collaboration of the National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN) and Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), addresses the need for cultural and linguistic diversity among health professionals. HCN will broadcast interviews of Role Models on its 250 affiliated Spanish-language popular radio stations nationwide to inform Spanish-speakers about the range of health careers open to them with proper education and to inspire them to imagine themselves as successful professionals. This effort will be combined with the creation of a number of bilingual online resources for health career aspirants, including an extensive database of volunteer professionals who have said ""Si!Sere Mentor!"" (""Yes!

"Bridges to the Doctorate in Nursing for Northeastern Ohio ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in the US have significant impact on the health of Americans. To successfully address health disparities requires increasing the number of scientists from the groups most commonly impacted by health disparities. As the largest group of health care professionals, nurses and nurse scientists have the potential to improve health disparities yet fewer than 2% of American RNs have PhDs. With the current national initiatives related to chronic diseases, the need for self-management, and ongoing health care reform to include team- based primary care, nurse scientists have the potential to make substantial and significant contributions to the science of improving health and to address health disparities. Yet there are too few nurse scientists, particularly from under-represented (UR) groups. The purpose of this project is to increase the number of nurse scientists from under-represented groups by providing a transitional program, bridging master's nursing students from Cleveland State University (CSU) and Ursuline College (UC) into the PhD program at the Frances Payne Bolton (FPB) School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University. Nursing, as a female predominant discipline, faces additional challenges in attaining PhDs beyond that faced by other scientific disciplines. Within MSN and PhD programs, there are increasing numbers of nurses from minority backgrounds, 29.3% and 27.7%, respectively. Despite this increased educational attainment, Schools of Nursing remain with too few nurse faculty from UR groups: fewer than 12% of nurse faculty come from minority backgrounds. The aims of the 5 year project are to: 1. Identify and recruit 5 cohorts of Bridges participants during their master's degree programs, one cohort (n = 4) in each year, and provide mentored research experience (years 1 through 5) 2. Provide joint mentoring by UC, CSU and FPB to Bridges participants (years 1 through 5) with a focus on identifying and addressing the gaps often experienced by students from UR groups to enhance retention and socialization into academic roles. 3. Admit Bridges student graduates from UC and CSU into PhD study at FPB/Case Western Reserve University. To accomplish these aims, have developed a plan to identify and recruit promising MSN students from UC and CSU who are in the MSN programs. We will select 2 students from CSU and 2 students from UC each year for a total of 20 students over the 5 year period. The Bridges students will then be assigned co-mentors, one from their MSN institution and one from FPB CWRU, and participate in paid mentored research experiences while they complete their MSNs. In addition, each cohort of 4 students will receive tailored programming to assist them in addressing needs and challenges that are specific to students from underrepresented groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nurse scientists can contribute to improvements in health disparities but there are too few nurse scientists from underrepresented groups. The intent of this program is to increase the number of nurse scientists by ""bridging"" students from MSN programs at Cleveland State University and Ursuline College into the PhD program in nursing at the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University.

"Profiles and Progress in Spanish English Bilinguals with Language Impairment: Development of a Criterion Reference Measure PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY We have made significant gains in the correct classification of Spanish-English bilinguals with language impairment though the identification of clinical markers of impairment. Yet a hurdle in reducing the health disparities associated with language impairment in bilingual populations is the need to establish developmental milestones that can serve as the foundation for goal setting and evaluation of progress as a function of language intervention. We know that experiential factors (age of acquisition and language use) interact with bilingual language outcomes. But we do not have a detailed picture of qualitative and quantitative differences between bilingual children with language impairment and their typically developing peers in the semantics and morphosyntax domains. The proposed project will translate the knowledge base regarding clinical markers of impairment, experiential factors, and knowledge of the linguistic systems of English and Spanish to the development of a clinical tool. The focus of the tool is to benchmark language learning in bilingual children growing up in the US context. Thus, the major aim of this project is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and set of probes in Spanish and English. These will be useful for intervention planning and to measure change as a function of language intervention. This tool will target 4-10 year old Spanish English bilinguals with and without language impairment. We will achieve this aim by 1) developing and evaluating an extension of our existing item set; 2) conducting an item tryout study to establish an item set for testing semantic and morphosyntactic performance profiles; and 3) field testing and validating a inventory and probes for profiling patterns of mastery in bilingual children with language impairment that is normed to account for age and language experience. To achieve these milestones, we will recruit 1200 bilingual children between the ages of 4 and 10 years of age from representative U.S. bilingual populations both in regard to dialect and SES. Using a modified matrix model, children will complete a battery of test items that tap key aspects of lexical-semantic and grammatical knowledge in English and Spanish. To make this tool maximally useful in clinical settings, we will program the task to be delivered by computer so that appropriate targets are selected based on the child's age and language experience and that sufficient targets are administered to accurately establish mastery and non-mastery. This research will form the foundation of a clinical tool that can be used by clinicians to establish goals and to document progress as a function of language intervention. This work will further our research in language impairment, especially with bilingual children, because we will document a broad profile of lexical semantic and morphosyntactic skills over a wider age range than is usually studied. The tools developed will also be useful for researchers who need to benchmark children's performance in developmental and intervention studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and probes of Spanish and English development for planning and measuring progress in language intervention. We will translate information about identifying language impairment in Spanish English bilinguals and the relationship between language experience and language growth to develop an item set for identifying patterns of mastery and non mastery of grammatical and lexical semantic targets in 4 to 10 year old bilinguals. This tool that will help clinicians develop and track progress in language invention.

"EMT en Espanol: Caregiver-Implemented Language Intervention for Young Spanish-Speaking Children This R21 application proposes to develop and test an adaptation of Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT), a naturalistic evidence-based caregiver-implemented communication intervention for young children with language impairment. The culturally and linguistically adapted intervention, EMT en Español, addresses a critical need for evidence-based communication interventions for an underserved population, Spanish-speaking children and their families from low-income households. Spanish-speaking caregivers who have children ages 30 to 42 months evidencing receptive and expressive language delays will be eligible. Caregiver-implemented intervention to support the development of home language is recommended for young children with language impairments; however, there are currently no evidence-based, culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions teaching Spanish-speaking caregivers language support strategies for very young children with significant language delays. The proposed project includes: (a) conducting a randomized trial of EMT en Español, a 4-month home-based intervention, with 40 caregivers and their children with language delays; (b) examination of caregiver use of EMT en Español strategies (responsiveness, matched turns, target talk, expansions, prompting) before intervention, after intervention and 3 months after intervention (c) exploring the impact of intervention on child expressive and receptive vocabulary post-intervention and at the 3 month follow up; and (d) assessing the acceptability, perceived effectiveness, and cultural appropriateness of the intervention. The development of assessment protocols, intervention materials, and caregiver training procedures, together with data on parent and child outcomes from the RTC and the feasibility evaluation will provide the basis for a subsequent, large scale randomized control trial to examine the impact of caregiver-implemented home language intervention on critical long term outcomes including vocabulary, complex syntax, and reading in both Spanish and English for young children with language impairment. This intervention development project addresses the NIH goal of reducing disparities in access to health promoting interventions as well as the NIH research agenda to address the health needs of racial and ethnic minorities, rural and urban poor, in order to improve access to care for underserved populations.   The proposed project tests the effect of a caregiver-implemented language intervention designed for Spanish- speaking caregivers and their 30-42 month old children from low-income households. Spanish-speaking immigrant families represent a rapidly growing and vulnerable population with limited access to intervention services when their children present with language delays early on, thus, children are likely to have continued difficulties and are at risk for academic failure. This intervention has the potential to reduce disparities in early intervention services for this ethnic and linguistic minority population.",EMT en Espanol: Caregiver-Implemented Language Intervention for Young Spanish-Speaking Children,9360543,R21DC015850,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Belief ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Language ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Household ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Reading ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Child Support ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Rural ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' English Language ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' caregiver education ', ' caregiver training ', ' care giver training ', ' care giver instruction ', ' care giver education ', ' Caregiver instruction ', ' Improve Access ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' service intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trial design ', ' language impairment ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' lower income families ', ' ']",NIDCD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,0.04747105171164693
"Impact of Volume-Based Regionalization on Access to Care in Patients Undergoing Pancreatectomy Project Summary/Abstract  Hospital volume has been shown to be inversely correlated with surgical mortality rates in complex surgery. Since the popularization of its concept, there has been a push towards volume-based regionalization of pancreatectomy. This past year, three major health systems have imposed minimum- volume standards that will bar hospitals and surgeons not meeting the threshold from performing complex surgery, and are pushing for other health systems to pledge to the low-volume threshold mandate.  However, the impact of such a regionalization strategy on patient preferences and access to care remains unclear. Pancreatectomy has demonstrated the most pronounced association between volume and mortality rates, and represents the procedure that stands to gain the most from such a policy. However, national data demonstrates that up to 70% of patients with early stage pancreatic cancer do not receive surgical intervention, of which racial minorities, patients on Medicaid and the uninsured make up the majority of this cohort. This was hypothesized to be secondary to nihilism towards the disease and the complexity of the operation needed for hopes of long-term survival. As such, a proposed low-volume threshold mandate may cause unintended consequences by exerting more constraints on patients to receive care.  Preliminary data has demonstrated that the vulnerable cohort as described above tend to travel shorter distances for pancreatectomy, and often undergo the surgery at hospitals with poorer quality. The objective of this study is to assess the potential impact of the proposed low-volume threshold mandate on access to care in patients undergoing pancreatectomy. Specifically, we will quantitatively assess the impact on distance needed to travel by patients and overall mortality rates in a setting where all patients are redirected to high-volume centers, and a simulated setting where patients with lower likelihood of travelling do not receive care. Additionally, we will perform qualitative assessment of the facilitators and constraints that patients face to receive care.  When completed, this study will provide novel data highlighting the impact of volume-based regionalization on access to care. Additionally, it will bring attention to reduce current disparities in health care quality and access with respect to vulnerable populations, and inform interventions to alleviate the issue, a core goal of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Lastly, our study will provide stimulus for research in more appropriate measures of quality than volume, as volume may be over-simplifying a complex issue and a dangerous metric to be incentivizing hospitals on. Project Narrative While volume-based regionalization of a complex procedure like pancreatectomy may improve outcomes of patients receiving the procedure, it may have a detrimental impact on access to care. This study will attempt to quantify the impact of a proposed low- volume threshold mandate on access to care, and qualitatively assess facilitators and constraints patients face to access care to inform interventions and policy decisions that can alleviate this public health burden.",Impact of Volume-Based Regionalization on Access to Care in Patients Undergoing Pancreatectomy,9329000,F32CA217455,"['Attention ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Interview ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pancreatectomy ', ' Pancreas Excision ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Travel ', ' Measures ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Stimulus ', ' Policies ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Complex ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' primary care setting ', ' operation ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,F32,2017,76990,0.005809951197458249
"Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: A model to improve primary care for Hispanics with diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: An Intervention to Improve Nursing Care for Hispanics with Diabetes ABSTRACT Language barriers in healthcare are recognized as a leading determinant of health disparities among Hispanics in the United States.1 Limited English proficiency (LEP) has also been linked to the soaring diabetes epidemic among Hispanics. For Hispanics, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is 1.5 times that of non- Hispanic whites.3 Hispanic patients who do not speak English at home are at greater risk of foregoing diabetes care and they are significantly less likely than non-Hispanics to adopt a special diet for diabetes control, to exercise regularly, and to receive a yearly eye examination.6, 3 Recent research suggests that language concordance (LC) between patients and primary care providers is an effective precondition that improves outcomes in the treatment of LEP patients with diabetes. Interventions to increase the number of LC nurse practitioners consist of educational programs that develop second language (L2) abilities for health care professionals. A review of extant literature on L2 training for health professionals revealed that the preponderance of programs and materials are directed at basic levels of proficiency and confined to limited types of clinical interactions. The view of he present research team is that these programs and materials are substantially geared towards acute care and reflect a mismatch between an LEP patient population with chronic illnesses and a health professional workforce trained in L2 for acute care functions. This mismatch, we contend, exacerbates the difficulties faced by LEP patients with diabetes in achieving successful self- management and the physical and emotional wellness that goes along with it. This proposal describes the design and evaluation of an innovative educational intervention for nurse practitioner students called Integrated Language Learning for Chronic Care (IL2L). It pursues an integrated development of L2 and communication skills that will facilitate productive interactions between Spanish-speaking nurse practitioners and LEP Hispanic patients with diabetes. A mixed-method study design will be used to examine the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of the intervention. At the patient level, we will employ an RCT to determine the impact IL2L on the physical health, mental health, and self-efficacy of patients with uncontrolled diabetes. At the student level, we will employ the Roter Interaction Analysis System to measure gains in Spanish language interaction skills pre and post intervention. At the program level, we will use language program evaluation methodologies to assess the acceptability of the intervention within a nurse practitioner training program in a leading College of Nursing.

"Profiles and Progress in Spanish English Bilinguals with Language Impairment: Development of a Criterion Reference Measure PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY We have made significant gains in the correct classification of Spanish-English bilinguals with language impairment though the identification of clinical markers of impairment. Yet a hurdle in reducing the health disparities associated with language impairment in bilingual populations is the need to establish developmental milestones that can serve as the foundation for goal setting and evaluation of progress as a function of language intervention. We know that experiential factors (age of acquisition and language use) interact with bilingual language outcomes. But we do not have a detailed picture of qualitative and quantitative differences between bilingual children with language impairment and their typically developing peers in the semantics and morphosyntax domains. The proposed project will translate the knowledge base regarding clinical markers of impairment, experiential factors, and knowledge of the linguistic systems of English and Spanish to the development of a clinical tool. The focus of the tool is to benchmark language learning in bilingual children growing up in the US context. Thus, the major aim of this project is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and set of probes in Spanish and English. These will be useful for intervention planning and to measure change as a function of language intervention. This tool will target 4-10 year old Spanish English bilinguals with and without language impairment. We will achieve this aim by 1) developing and evaluating an extension of our existing item set; 2) conducting an item tryout study to establish an item set for testing semantic and morphosyntactic performance profiles; and 3) field testing and validating a inventory and probes for profiling patterns of mastery in bilingual children with language impairment that is normed to account for age and language experience. To achieve these milestones, we will recruit 1200 bilingual children between the ages of 4 and 10 years of age from representative U.S. bilingual populations both in regard to dialect and SES. Using a modified matrix model, children will complete a battery of test items that tap key aspects of lexical-semantic and grammatical knowledge in English and Spanish. To make this tool maximally useful in clinical settings, we will program the task to be delivered by computer so that appropriate targets are selected based on the child's age and language experience and that sufficient targets are administered to accurately establish mastery and non-mastery. This research will form the foundation of a clinical tool that can be used by clinicians to establish goals and to document progress as a function of language intervention. This work will further our research in language impairment, especially with bilingual children, because we will document a broad profile of lexical semantic and morphosyntactic skills over a wider age range than is usually studied. The tools developed will also be useful for researchers who need to benchmark children's performance in developmental and intervention studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and probes of Spanish and English development for planning and measuring progress in language intervention. We will translate information about identifying language impairment in Spanish English bilinguals and the relationship between language experience and language growth to develop an item set for identifying patterns of mastery and non mastery of grammatical and lexical semantic targets in 4 to 10 year old bilinguals. This tool that will help clinicians develop and track progress in language invention.

"Language Barriers and Post-Acute Outcomes in Home Care: A Mixed Methods Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immigrants comprise 13% of the US population and 25.2 million US residents are categorized as having limited English speaking skills, defined as the inability to understand healthcare communication in English. The number of limited English proficiency (LEP) individuals living in the US grew 80% between 1990 and 2010 and they represent 10% or more of the populations in the 13 most highly populous states. As a result, healthcare workers in the US are more likely than ever to regularly encounter LEP patients in their practice. Language barriers likely pose a particularly vexing problem for the complex care coordination processes that occur when patients transition from the hospital to home care, representing an understudied problem. We know that LEP status increases a patient's risk for readmission between 15 and 25% and that there are effective means for reducing these barriers, e.g. adequate interpreter services. Yet there is a critical gap in our understanding of how language barriers impact the transition to home healthcare and the personnel, patient, and organizational factors that might influence post-acute discharge outcomes in LEP patients. Our overall goal is to understand how language barriers impact 30-day rehospitalization and home healthcare resource utilization among LEP patients recently discharged from the hospital, with a secondary aim of understanding their impact on functional status. We will accomplish this goal by conducting a mixed methods study in partnership with The Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), which documents the language skills and abilities of its employees and patients thereby allowing us to identify linguistically concordant visits in its extensive database of over  million LEP patient visits coming from 86,000 clients, with four language groups (Spanish, Korean, Russian, Chinese). This unique but nationally representative dataset and the New York City location of the study offers an appropriate environment to study this problem. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the largest and most diverse study of the influence of language barriers on critical clinical patient outcomes in the US. Results from this study will have policy and research implications for the organization and management of care coordination for LEP patients. This study will complement existing initiatives at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality focused on improving patient-provider communication for LEP patient populations, reducing racial and ethnic health disparities, improving care for vulnerable populations, improving post-hospital discharge processes, and addressing patient safety across the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One fifth of households in the United States speak a language other than English at home. By examining the associations between patient-provider language concordance, interpreter use, and post-acute care outcomes in the home healthcare setting along with ascertaining the dynamics of systemic care coordination issues, we can ensure that patients with a language barrier do not have their health outcomes adversely affected after a hospitalization episode. This will be the largest study of the impact of the healthcare system on LEP patient outcomes, including re-hospitalization, with implications that will make a major impact on US health services.",Language Barriers and Post-Acute Outcomes in Home Care: A Mixed Methods Analysis,9264980,R01HS023593,[''],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,249900,0.06769545866144662
"Quality of Early Mother-Child Communication and Language Outcome in Low-Income Hispanic Children Project Abstract Academic trajectories are established early, and children who enter school without the requisite readiness skills are at greatest risk for academic failure. Although language ability in early childhood is one of the strongest predictors of school readiness, many low-income children are markedly delayed in language ability. Dubbed the 30-million word gap, Hart and Risley (1995) demonstrated that children living in poverty hear substantially fewer words than their more affluent peers, and these findings have spurred national initiatives designed to increase the quantity of language input to young low-income children to establish positive early learning trajectories. However, exciting new research suggests these well-intentioned interventions may not have their desired impact if they do not also increase the quality of the communication foundation supporting language learning during early caregiver-child interactions. Hispanic children in Spanish-speaking and low income households are at significant risk for language delays and early academic failure, but there is little research regarding how to best support their language development and academic success. Our new findings regarding the importance of the quality of the communication foundation in the earliest years highlight how nonverbal and verbal qualities of parent-child interactions support the development of language skill and pave the way for developing optimal interventions. Spanish-speaking children are an important target for such interventions. An important preliminary step towards this goal, however, is to replicate this compelling research conducted with non-Hispanic African American and European American children with Spanish-speaking children. Building upon an existing study in Dallas that includes a large number of Mexican-origin Spanish- speaking families, we are uniquely positioned to address the following three aims: Aim 1. To refine the measurement methods for assessing the quality of the communication foundation so that they encompass culturally distinct patterns of parent-child interaction among Spanish- speaking Mexican-American families. Aim 2. To examine the relation between the quality of the early communication foundation and subsequent child language development among young Spanish-speaking Mexican-American children. Aim 3. To examine the relation between the quality of the early communication foundation and academic achievement in kindergarten and first grade among young Spanish-speaking Mexican- American children and whether it is mediated by early language development. Methods will include a comprehensive review and systematic modification of the existing rating protocol to capture those aspects of the early communication foundation among low-income Spanish-speaking mothers and their children. This revised rating system will be applied to existing data for a longitudinal cohort of low- income Mexican-American children selected from the Dallas Preschool Readiness Study (DPReP). Multivariate regression methods will be used to examine relations between the communication foundation assessed at age 2½ with language and school readiness outcomes at ages 3½ and kindergarten. Project Narrative Hispanic children in Spanish-speaking and low income households are at heightened risk for language delays and early academic failure. In this study, we will use video-recorded data from an established study to refine a rating system to capture characteristics of the quality of the early communication foundation among low- income Spanish-speaking mothers and their 2½ year old children. Data captured using this refined rating system will be used to examine relations between the quality of the communication foundation and later child language development and school readiness using data already being collected as part of the parent longitudinal study.",Quality of Early Mother-Child Communication and Language Outcome in Low-Income Hispanic Children,9341371,R01HD086832,"['experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' high school ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 2 year old ', ' two years of age ', ' two year old ', ' aged two years ', ' aged 2 years ', ' age 2 years ', ' 2 years of age ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Child Language ', ' Communication ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Household ', ' Intelligence ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mother-Child Relations ', ' mother child interaction ', ' Mother-Child Relationship ', ' Mothers ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' County ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Rituals ', ' Ritual compulsion ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' first grade ', ' 1st grade ', ' American ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2017,314054,0.03922508838472152
"System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care  Over the past decade, the proportion of minority older adults residing in nursing homes (NHs) has increased dramatically and is projected to surpass that of white adults by 2030.1 NHs account for 68% of the $72 billion spent on long-term care in 2008 with most of it funded by Medicaid. These demographic and financial realities create an urgency to understand the needs of minorities in NHs and how systems organization and care delivery in NHs operate to ensure that minority residents maintain quality of life (QoL) and receive quality of care (QoC) equitable to white residents. QoL is a patient-centered measure that captures social, psychological, and environmental well-being. QoC typically consists of staff-reported indicators of care delivery and its related to clinical outcomes (e.g., pressure ulcers). Racial disparities exist in certain QoC indicators, and our recent work for the first time found racial disparities in NH resident QoL. However, those disparities were not based on individual race/ethnicity, but reflected system-wide factors affecting NHs that served more minority residents. Some of these factors are not amenable to intervention, including location of high-minority proportion NHs in poorer areas. There is a need to identify modifiable system-wide mechanisms for these disparities to craft interventions that address them.  Our long-term goal is to develop an intervention for improving QoL for minority NH residents nationwide. To build toward that goal, we designed a multi-method study to examine organizational structures and processes of care in NHs with high and low proportions of minorities, and then assess system-level predictors of NH QoL (primary outcome) and QoC (secondary outcomes) in a unique state-level database with more granular measures as well as a nationally-representative database. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1: Assess and compare, via qualitative methods, the structural, cultural, and process factors influencing QoL and QoC for minority residents among NHs with high, moderate, and low proportions of minority residents. Aim 2: Determine the effect of system-level factors on racial/ethnic differences in NH QoL(primary) and QoC (secondary outcome) using a unique statewide dataset. Aim 3: Using national data from all licensed NHs in the US, test the effect of system-level predictors on racial differences in QoL (primary) and QoC (secondary outcome).

"The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 10 million Americans are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These dual-eligibles are a disproportionately high-cost population with substantial and often unmet healthcare needs. They are also more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and experience potentially-preventable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits resulting from disparities in access to primary care. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between primary care access and the broader continuum of potentially-preventable hospital care, which includes not only ED visits and hospitalizations, but also observation stays, 30-day return ED visits, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are “safety net” providers that receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations without regard for patients' ability to pay. FQHCs are known to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and quality, but dual-eligibles' use of FQHCs has not been well studied. Moreover, modifiable organizational characteristics that may explain variations in FQHC performance related to reducing disparities are not well understood. Thus, the objective of this study is to characterize and evaluate the role of FQHCs in providing primary care that lowers rates of—and reduces racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care among dual-eligibles. The proposed study has three specific aims: 1) To determine the extent to which FQHCs reduce hospital care relative to receiving care from other primary care providers; 2) To determine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in hospital care are reduced among FQHC users relative to those receiving care from other primary care providers; and 3) To determine the extent to which organizational characteristics enhance the ability of FQHCs to reduce hospital care and related racial/ethnic disparities in care. Using seven years of Medicare claims data (2012 – 2018) rates of—and disparities in—hospital care will be modeled as a function of FQHC use and other primary care sources. The extent to which disparities exist within or between FQHCs will also be assessed. Finally, FQHC-specific hospital care rates will be modeled as a function of FQHC characteristics using Medicare claims and FQHC data from the Uniform Data System. The proposed study is significant, because it will provide evidence of the relative effectiveness of FQHCs at lowering rates of—and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care and identify modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices. The proposed study is innovative because it is the first to examine the relationship between FQHC use and racial/ethnic disparities in the broader continuum of hospital care among dual-eligibles using quasi-experimental methods (i.e., instrumental variable and difference-in-differences analyses) to address selection bias, and the first to model organizational disparities in hospital care rates across FQHCs as a function of FQHC characteristics. This study is expected to have an immediate positive impact for CMS policymakers, state Medicaid agencies, providers (particularly FQHCs), hospitals, and dual-eligible patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to further our understanding of how to use federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to improve access to primary care and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in costly and potentially-preventable hospital care among the dual-eligible population. Moreover, by identifying modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices, the proposed research has the potential to inform improvements in care delivery at low-performing FQHCs. The project is relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities because it focuses on understanding how FQHCs can be used to improve access to care and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities among dual-eligibles.",The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles,9328212,R01MD011513,"['Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Cost Control ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Funding ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Modeling ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,491565,0.006654268418880105
"Bridges to the Bacclaureate Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) partnership between the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing (NHWSN) at Emory University and the Nursing Program at Georgia Perimeter College (GPC). The program focuses on identifying students from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups - groups who are underrepresented in nursing and nursing science as well - and supporting them through the associate degree to the baccalaureate in nursing (BSN) and on to careers in nursing science in the PhD program in Nursing at Emory or at similar research-intensive institutions. BttB aims to increase the number of underrepresented students who complete the AS degree in Nursing at GPC and enter the BSN program at NHWSN; who develop skills and knowledge in nursing science; and who are socialized into the culture and profession of nursing science and move forward to doctoral studies. BttB responds to national needs to address the nursing shortage by developing a next generation of nursing scientists to be faculty in schools of nursing who both teach and create the evidence for improved practice. It also addresses the IOM call for nursing leadership to work with other professions to develop innovative solutions to the nation's health care crisis and to the persistent problem of health disparities. The BttB program will consist of five elements; (1) recruitment and enrollment; (2) research exposure; (3) research immersion; (4) academic programming; and (5) mentoring, advising, and counseling. Faculty from both institutions will participate in selecting GPC students into the BttB program in their first semester in the GPC nursing program. Research roundtables and summer and school-year research immersion experiences will strengthen the environment of research at GPC and will enable students to learn about nursing science both conceptually and experientially. The roundtable and immersion experiences will continue when students transfer to NHWSN and enter an RN-BSN program that is specifically tailored to accommodate their prior training and to further immerse them in nursing science. At NHWSN, BttB students will be in an environment characterized by the active conduct of funded research by a large number of tenured and tenure track faculty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Bridges to the Baccalaureate (BttB) program seeks to move underrepresented students from an associate degree in nursing (AS) program through a bachelor degree in nursing (BSN) program and to a point of readiness for doctoral training in nursing science.

"Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent racial disparities in neonatal mortality rates are a major public health concern. Black neonates are more than twice as likely to die as white neonates. In previous research in New York City (NYC) hospitals, we found nearly a three-fold variation in risk-adjusted very low birth weight (VLBW) neonatal mortality rates among hospitals and black infants were much more likely to be born at higher mortality hospitals. The factors that influence wide variation in mortality rates among hospitals are not known. Why black women are more likely to deliver at higher mortality hospitals is also unknown. The objectives of this study are: 1) To examine risk- adjusted neonatal mortality among New York City hospitals over the past decade and assess the extent to which variations in hospital quality contribute to VLBW mortality disparities for blacks and Latinos; 2) To use an innovative mixed methods approach to explore processes of care, unit characteristics, patient factors, and organizational factors that explain differences in hospital quality as measured by overall and cause-specific risk-adjusted mortality rates and use of evidence-based practices; 3) To explore patients' perspectives on barriers to receipt of high quality care by exploring barriers to timely care, communication, availability of high risk obstetrics care, knowledge, decision-making regarding delivery hospital, and perception of risk; and 4) To create specific strategies with key stakeholders to promote uptake of best practices at hospitals caring for VLBW infants including patient-centered strategies to minimize barriers to receipt of high quality care. Methods: In Phase 1, we will use NYC Vital Statistics records linked with New York State Discharge Abstract Data to develop a risk-adjusted VLBW neonatal mortality model. We will use this model to rank hospitals based on risk-adjusted mortality. We will then examine the distribution of black, Latino, and white births among hospitals. In Phases 2 and 3 we will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to determine which hospital factors and practice patterns may explain the wide variation in mortality outcomes among hospitals and to explore why black mothers deliver in higher mortality hospitals. We will then convene leaders of obstetrics and neonatologists, hospital quality leaders, community leaders, NYC and State Departments of Health, and patients to discuss our results and explore interventions to improve care for VLBW infants. Information from this study will provide a better understanding of quality in neonatal care in hospitals and reveal specific processes of care that can be improved upon to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant black/white disparities in neonatal mortality rates are partially explained by the fact that black mothers are more likely to deliver in higher mortaliy hospitals. Results from this study will explore why such wide variations in hospital neonatal mortality rates exist and why black moms deliver at higher mortality hospitals. Ultimately, our findings will direct future efforts to reduce racial disparities in neonatal outcomes.",Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths,9248402,R01HD078565,"['Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' newborn mortality ', ' newborn death ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Nurseries ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Knowledge ', ' neonatal death ', ' neonatal demise ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' infant death ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' Performance ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' hospital organization ', ' Consequentialism ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' neonate ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' neonatal care ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' perinatal outcomes ', ' surfactant replacement therapy ', ' neonatal outcome ', ' black/white disparity ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' antenatal ', ' antepartum ', ' ']",NICHD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,637303,0.042361455707270144
"Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes. The organization and practice of nursing have substantial positive effects on patient care and patient  outcomes. As a result of our NINR-sponsored research program continually funded since 1997, organization-based nursing interventions are now more often considered as potential solutions to poor quality and unsafe care. Organizational factors include nurse education, via preferential hiring practices  and educational benefits to employees~ nurse staffing, an evolving ""industry standard"" that has been the  focus of legislation~ human resource policies which determine nursing skill mix~ and the nursing work  environment-the organizational practices fostering the autonomy and authority required for nurses to  translate their education and experience into effective nursing care. In large, multi-state surveys of US nurses conducted in 1999 and in 2006, we have applied innovative sampling, aggregation, and measurement methods to provide rich information on nursing never before available for large numbers of  healthcare organizations that is linked to patient outcomes to document the empirical relationship between  nursing and outcomes. These data have been used to answer a range of compelling practice and policy questions about the contributions of nurses to safe, effective care. This application is an efficient, innovative extension of our line of research creating a large study of the impact of change in nursing factors on outcomes, seeking to determine more about causality in order to spur implementation of recommendations emerging from research. We will replicate in 2014 measurements made in 2006 (and 1999 in Pennsylvania) across approximately 665 hospitals and hundreds of nursing homes and home care agencies in four large states with measurement before and after the national economic downturn and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The great strength of the application is that in creating a panel of organizational observations, we can see where change has occurred and why. Specific aims are to: 1)  Collect data from random samples of nurses in CA, FL, NJ, and PA~ 2) Examine organizational-level  changes over time in nurse inputs in (a) education, (b) staffing, (c) skill mix, and (d) work environment  between 1999, 2006, and 2014~ 3) Estimate the effects of organizational-level changes on outcomes for  patients including minorities and those with chronic illnesses and determine whether lesser improvement in  nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has widened the disparity in outcomes between white and  minority patients~ and 4) Determine the effects of nursing factors in nursing home and home health agency  patient outcomes while accounting for variation in patient clinical severity and complexity.  The overarching aim of the proposed study is to determine points of comparatively low-cost organizational leverage of nursing inputs to improve patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In studying health care organizations over time, we learn what kinds of changes in nursing resources have occurred and thus are possible, and the consequences of changes for quality of care and patient outcomes.

"PROMIS-Deaf Profile: Inclusion of Deaf Patients in Disability and Outcomes Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current patient-reported outcome measures are heavily dependent on English, which present serious language barriers to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) patients who use American Sign Language (ASL). The availability of patient-reported outcome measures in ASL and English and such that is valid for users of accessible technology and services will provide important insights on improving prevention and treatment models that will lead to better personal and public health within the underserved DHH population. The research plan builds on Dr. Kushalnagar's prior research on communication and quality of life outcomes with deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) population. Communication-related fatigue is relevant to healthcare outcomes. Specific aims include (1) describing the linguistic and internal validity of PROMIS-Deaf profile, (2) examining QoL domains across DHH sub-groups, and (3) evaluating the prevalence of communicative stress and risk factors for health status and generic QoL in a nationwide sample of early-deafened adults. The study will be conducted by a research team that includes: an early career investigator with expertise in quality of life outcomes in DHH population, a senior investigator with expertise in patient reported outcome measures (the creator of the FACIT fatigue QoL measure), a psychometrician with experience in conducting IRT and psychometric analyses for patient reported outcome measures, an audiologist with expertise in (re)habilitative audiology and hearing related outcomes, an ASL translation expert, and a biostatistician. The Advisory Committee consists of experts on the subject matter related to the project and who are nationally known for their work with DHH population. Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that may contribute to poor quality of life frequently observed for individuals with hearing loss. The goals of this application are consistent with the NIDCD 2012-2016 strategies related to improving outcomes for human communication and reducing health disparities, and expected findings will support the development of a future grant proposal for a randomized study that will assess the ability of PROMIS- Deaf profile to detect minimally important changes with intervention.

"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI.

"Disparities in the Outcomes and Processes of Care for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The Role of Differences in the Organization and Delivery of Nursing Project Summary In-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) represent catastrophic, often terminal events and affect up to 700,000 patients annually. Despite the resources and opportunity to intervene early when cardiac arrests occur, fewer than a quarter of patients survive to discharge, and survival varies significantly across institutions and by race. Black patients, in particular, experience up to 12% lower odds of survival and more pronounced neurologic and functional impairment following a cardiac arrest. Disparities in cardiac arrest outcomes are largely attributed to quality gaps at the institutions where minorities receive care. Variations in the process of care delivery in these settings suggests that hospitals where Blacks receive care may be fundamentally different in their ability to detect and prevent death and significant debilitation. Our study will examine institutional mechanisms underlying IHCA disparities through a focused examination of front line care providers. In the hospital, nurses are the primary clinical surveillance system and play an integral role in the initiation and delivery of emergency responses. Nurses are at the bedside 24 hours a day; they are responsible for early warning system monitoring; they have direct knowledge of patient conditions and changes in conditions and are often the first on the scene of a cardiac arrest. The ability for nurses to respond appropriately to acute changes in patient status has been linked to nursing organizational factors, including nurse staffing, nurse education, nursing skill mix, and the nurse work environment. The relationship between the organization of nursing and minority IHCA outcomes, however, is unknown. We posit that nurses play a significant, yet underexplored, role in IHCA patient outcomes, and that variation in nursing across hospitals may help explain IHCA outcome disparities. To examine this relationship, we take advantage of multiple large and unique databases: The American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines–Resuscitation (GWTG-R) clinical registry and the NINR-funded RN4CAST-US studies (R01-NR004513 and R01-NR014855). The clinical registry incorporates uniformly reported and precisely defined clinical variables developed by international experts. Using unique hospital identifiers to link patient outcomes with measures of nursing care from RN4CAST-US, we will identify specific, actionable elements of nursing that influence minority IHCA patient outcomes. The data set that we will assemble includes nurse survey data collected in 2006 and 2015. Using independent cross-sections of tens of thousands of patients in the same large sample of hospitals, enables us to examine trends and relationships between nursing and minority IHCA outcomes and determine if they vary over time. Knowing whether these associations are stable and enduring, in spite of changes in both patient case-mix and acuity and in the nursing characteristics that may be greater in some hospitals than others, will provide stronger evidence that the associations are persistent and that our results are generalizable. Project Narrative Racial disparities in In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (IHCA) outcomes are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By examining the inter-related effects of nursing care organization and delivery, our study will help explain previously unexplored causes of IHCA disparities and inform efforts to improve clinical care in the hospitals that could most benefit from them.",Disparities in the Outcomes and Processes of Care for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The Role of Differences in the Organization and Delivery of Nursing,9470983,R01MD011518,"['Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Nursing Education ', ' electric countershock heart resuscitation ', ' defibrillation ', ' Electric Defibrillation ', ' Cardioversion ', ' Cardiac Electroversions ', ' Cardiac Electroversion ', ' Electric Countershock ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Process ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' Measures ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' nursing skill ', ' Provider ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' data registry ', ' Emergency response ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' individual patient ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,374391,0.1220984786717387
"Impact of Bundled Payment Reforms on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hip and Knee Replacement Surgeries Project Abstract: Hip and knee replacement surgeries for elderly Medicare beneficiaries have important clinical implications given their effectiveness for advanced osteoarthritis; and important financial implications given their high volume, expenditure, and expected growth in demand. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the care of these surgeries are well-documented. Our preliminary analysis and other studies have demonstrated that blacks undergo these surgeries less frequently and have poorer outcomes as compared to whites, and that patients from lower socioeconomic strata face greater barriers than those from the upper socioeconomic strata in their access to these surgeries. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) Model, which is a bundled payment reform that bundles/includes most spending related to these surgeries (beginning with the inpatient stay, continuing to post-acute care, and ending 90 days after discharge from the hospital) under a single surgical episode. Hospitals, clinicians and post-acute care facilities are therefore financially incentivized to improve the coordination of care across settings, to keep their spending low and to meet important quality benchmarks. However, experts have raised concerns that in the absence of metrics aimed at reducing disparities, the design of the CJR is likely to exacerbate disparities in hip and knee replacement care across patients of different racial and socioeconomic categories, and across hospitals that serve varying proportions of minority patients. These concerns have considerable face validity, yet the impact of bundled payments in general, and the CJR in particular, on disparities has not been empirically evaluated. In light of these gaps in empirical literature, the aims of our proposal are to evaluate the impact of the CJR on racial and socioeconomic disparities in utilization (Aim 1), inpatient outcomes (Aim 2), and post-acute care outcomes (Aim 3) of hip and knee replacement care. Furthermore, we will identify key mechanisms that influence CJR's impact on disparities, and investigate if the changes in outcomes and disparities that we expect are mediated by the choice of post-acute care facility to which a patient is discharged (Aim 4). The overarching rationale for these aims is that in pursuit of financial rewards from the CJR, hospitals are likely to avoid sicker patients, many of whom are likely to be racial and socioeconomic minorities; and hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities will adopt cost-reduction strategies that may target and adversely influence minority patients, thereby exacerbating disparities. We will conduct rigorous longitudinal analyses using national data to address the specific aims and test associated hypotheses. The knowledge gained from our study will inform the design of current and future bundled payment reforms such that these reforms can prevent the exacerbation of and contribute in reducing existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in hip and knee replacement surgeries."" Project Narrative: The proposed project will evaluate whether the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model of 2016 has exacerbated disparities in the use and outcomes of hip and knee replacement care among elderly Medicare patients belonging to racial minority groups, and to lower socioeconomic groups. The knowledge generated from the proposed study will influence the design of this and other related bundled payment models, such that existing racial and socioeconomic disparities can be effectively reduced. This knowledge will benefit (i) patients undergoing these surgeries in the future by supporting provision of equitable care; (ii) hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities by generating evidence to better understand their responses to this Model; and (iii) policy makers by generating knowledge that will support the design of current and future policy reforms to effectively reduce disparities.",Impact of Bundled Payment Reforms on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hip and Knee Replacement Surgeries,9468901,R01MD012422,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Behavior ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Measures ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' care episode ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' joint replacement ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Adopted ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' metropolitan ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' payment ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' financial incentive ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2017,385000,0.004985963512377208
"Bilingual e-Book Platform for Early Childhood Literacy Development and Intrafamiliar Communication PROJECT SUMMARY The number and quality of utterances a child is exposed to, especially during interactions with his/her parents and caregivers, has profound effects on early language development, and forms the foundation for early language acquisition—a critical developmental process and established predictor of later interpersonal and academic achievement. Storytelling is a powerful medium for promoting language development, particularly when contextualized in parent-child co-reading. While there exists a vast array of children's literature, bilingual content is grossly underrepresented in children's publications, despite the rapidly increasing proportion of language minorities in the US. As a consequence, opportunities for facilitating language development and the quality of interactions through children's literature are constricted for children in homes with limited English proficient (LEP) parents. A more conscientious and sophisticated approach to bilingual storytelling, building on authentic language acquisition mechanism, is warranted to support the literacy development of children from minority language households. Addressing these challenges, this project will assess the feasibility of a comprehensive ecosystem for the creation of bilingual children's literature, incorporating a feedback mechanism allowing parents to gain insight in interactional patterns with their children built into eBook format. Building on the concept of code switching, a natural way of acquiring a language, the content creation methodology guides the production of content with a unique language blend, allowing gradually increased exposure to a second language as proficiency progresses. This approach is based on standardized linguistic rules, developed to promote a pedagogical transition between languages. The feedback feature in the platform will be enabled through recordings of reading sessions, and will provide users with a report of communication behaviors occurring between a parent and child. In approaching language development through more authentic representations of bilingual content, the Blossom ecosystem will contribute to alleviating disparities related to language acquisition among children in LEP households. We will partner with a number of professionals in the early-childhood education space and veterans from the children's media industry and publishing throughout the development and evaluation phases of this novel platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children from language minority and limited English proficient (LEP) households in the United States face a growing number of language development disparities as a result of linguistic isolation. In order to address these barriers, we propose an ecosystem that takes a nuanced and authentic approach to bilingual children's literature, and further facilitates language learning by providing constructive feedback that promotes parent- child communication. The current proposal seeks to develop a minimally viable prototype (MVP) of the content creation and consumption platform, and conduct a feasibility evaluation of the system to assess consumer acceptance.",Bilingual e-Book Platform for Early Childhood Literacy Development and Intrafamiliar Communication,9347817,R43HD092164,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Language ', ' Communication ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industry ', ' Influentials ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Production ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Veterans ', ' Librarians ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Competence ', ' Comprehension ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Flowers ', ' Plant Blooms ', ' Blossoms ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' intergenerational ', ' early childhood ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' parent-child communication ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sesame - dietary ', ' Sesame ', ' Address ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Reader ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' product development ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' English Learner ', ' English Language Learner ', ' pedagogy ', ' interactive feedback ', ' electronic book ', ' Ebook ', ' E-book ', ' minority children ', ' lower income families ', ' ']",NICHD,"TRANSCENDENT INTERNATIONAL, LLC",R43,2017,202397,0.03333650723718491
"The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality of treatment for cancer-associated complications, those complications directly attributable to the cancer itself or that result from chemotherapy and/or radiation, have received little attention. This is particularly problematic as cancer-associated complications are associated with significant morbidity, are often accompanied by pain and discomfort, and require the expenditure of substantial healthcare resources for treatment. The management of cancer-associated complications is compounded by the availability of a myriad of treatment options, many of which are unproven and associated with significant cost. Little is known about the factors that influence allocation of care for thes complications and what factors influence outcome. The health care a patient receives and its associated outcomes are influenced by the interplay of a number of patient, physician, and hospital factors. For acute inpatient medical conditions the characteristics of the hospital in which a patient is treated play a crucial role. There is growing recognition that there is widespread between-hospital variation in how care is allocated and that these differences in practice patterns explain a large portion of treatment variability. Uninsured and minority patients are particularly vulnerable to these hospital level disparities as these patients are disproportionately more likely to receive care at facilities with limited clinical and financial resources that may adversely affect quality. In this proposal we will determine the quality of treatment for hospitalized patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of: febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia of malignancy, esophagitis, and acute cancer-associated pain. For each cancer-associated complication we will determine patterns of treatment, the factors that underlie treatment decisions, and the effect of prompt initiation of guideline-based therapy on outcomes. For each condition we will first examine the utilization of guideline-based and non-indicated treatments. We will then comprehensively examine the influence of patient, physician, and hospital characteristics as well as between- hospital variations on the allocation of guideline-based care. We hypothesize that there is substantial variation in treatment between hospitals that is unexplained by traditional measures. Finally, we will perform novel causal inference and mediation analyses to determine the direct and indirect effects operating through a mediator of prompt guideline-based treatment on outcomes (length of stay, readmission, cost, non-routine discharge and mortality) for each complication. In addition to including a number of novel statistical methodologies, this proposal will utilize a unique database ideally suited to the study of these complications. The data from these studies will lead to immediately actionable results that can be used to guide the implementation pragmatic hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To date, the complications that result either directly from cancer or from its treatment have received almost no attention. Our findings will provide important data on the management of these complications to patients, providers, and payers that are immediately actionable and can guide the development of targeted hospital-based interventions to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer-associated complications.",The Influence of Hospital Variability on the Management of Cancer-Associated Comp,9194389,R01CA169121,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Expenditure ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neutropenia ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Consensus ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' novel ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Modality ', ' Treatment-Related Cancer ', ' Treatment-Associated Cancer ', ' Therapy-Related Cancer ', ' Therapy-Associated Cancers ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Tumor ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Iatrogenic Cancer ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Provider ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' chemotherapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' common treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,332000,-0.01548694870834524
"The Impact of Cardiac Care Regionalization on Access, Treatment, and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Coronary heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is the leading cause of death in the United States. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a common and particularly severe form of AMI for which timely access to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is essential to good patient outcomes. In an attempt to improve outcomes for STEMI patients, STEMI regionalization systems have been established at the local and state level across the United States to quickly route or transfer STEMI patients to a hospital with PCI capability. However, no studies of this relatively new healthcare system have been able to show if and how regionalization has improved access and mortality at the community level, as prior work has been limited by studies done in single-hospital settings, the evaluation of only certain process outcomes, and the lack of inclusion of a control group to account for secular trends in improved mortality.  Our goals in this proposal are 3-fold: (1) to determine to what extent regionalized STEMI systems are associated with improvements in both access and outcomes, (2) whether vulnerable communities benefit equally within the same system, and (3) how distance and time differentially affect these outcomes. To accomplish these goals, we propose an innovative and definitive approach to study California, a state that provides a natural experiment of STEMI regionalization, as 47% of its population has resided in counties that have regionalized at different times over the study period. We will use a difference-in-differences approach and link non-public patient discharge data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development from 2006 through 2012 (≈90K STEMI patients) with a database designed by the PI of regionalization status of each county over the same period. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which overall access (defined by admission to PCI-capable hospital), treatment (receipt of PCI), and health outcomes differ for STEMI patients in regionalized vs. non-regionalized communities. We hypothesize that the change in probability of being admitted to a PCI-equipped hospital and of receiving PCI will be appreciably higher in counties experiencing regionalization than non-regionalized counties and that health outcomes will improve. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes have changed for STEMI patients in regionalized vs. non-regionalized communities. We hypothesize that STEMI patients who belong to traditionally underserved populations will have larger improvements in these metrics post-regionalization relative to the reference population. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which changes in access, treatment, and outcome differ for STEMI patients according to distance and time horizon following regionalization. We hypothesize that STEMI patients living farther away from regional PCI centers will benefit differentially more than those living closer to regional PCI centers, and benefits of regionalization may not be seen until 1-2 years post-implementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Clinicians and policymakers face decisions about whether to fundamentally restructure care networks in order to improve care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). These changes are often expensive, require massive organizational changes, and could have unintended adverse consequences. Little evidence is available to evaluate the effect of implementing these regional systems, particularly how they affect vulnerable populations. This project will inform future regionalization efforts on other health issues currently being debated and have collateral benefits on the approach to other organizational changes and their evaluation by creating a template for future efforts. This opportunity to study one particular strategy offers insight into how ongoing reorganization and re-design of health care systems affects patient outcomes.","The Impact of Cardiac Care Regionalization on Access, Treatment, and Outcomes",9457746,R01HL134182,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Masks ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Veins ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Process Measure ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' LGALS3BP gene ', ' MAC-2-BP ', ' 90K ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' database design ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient population ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,158500,0.02143953786285616
"Inclusion of Deaf/HH Sexual and Gender Minorities in Patient Reported Outcomes Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current patient-reported outcome measures are heavily dependent on English, which present serious language barriers to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) patients who use American Sign Language (ASL). The availability of patient-reported outcome measures in ASL and English and such that is valid for users of accessible technology and services will provide important insights on improving prevention and treatment models that will lead to better personal and public health within the underserved DHH population. The research plan builds on Dr. Kushalnagar's prior research on communication and quality of life outcomes with deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) population. Communication-related fatigue is relevant to healthcare outcomes. Specific aims include (1) describing the linguistic and internal validity of PROMIS-Deaf profile, (2) examining QoL domains across DHH sub-groups, and (3) evaluating the prevalence of communicative stress and risk factors for health status and generic QoL in a nationwide sample of early-deafened adults. The study will be conducted by a research team that includes: an early career investigator with expertise in quality of life outcomes in DHH population, a senior investigator with expertise in patient reported outcome measures (the creator of the FACIT fatigue QoL measure), a psychometrician with experience in conducting IRT and psychometric analyses for patient reported outcome measures, an audiologist with expertise in (re)habilitative audiology and hearing related outcomes, an ASL translation expert, and a biostatistician. The Advisory Committee consists of experts on the subject matter related to the project and who are nationally known for their work with DHH population. Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that may contribute to poor quality of life frequently observed for individuals with hearing loss. The goals of this application are consistent with the NIDCD 2012-2016 strategies related to improving outcomes for human communication and reducing health disparities, and expected findings will support the development of a future grant proposal for a randomized study that will assess the ability of PROMIS- Deaf profile to detect minimally important changes with intervention.

"The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes The National Institutes of Health and the American College of Surgeons recently suggested that one potential explanation for racial disparities in surgical outcomes is that minority and white patients may receive care in hospitals that provide differing quality of care. Few studies have been able to identify the factors underlying the between-hospital quality differences that are actionable targets for intervention through system redesign. Our work focuses on a systems feature given little attention in surgical disparities studies—differences in the nursing resources across hospitals, including registered nurse staffing and skill mix, the percentage of nurses with at least a bachelors in nursing (BSN) degree, and nurse work environments. Despite the large body of evidence linking these nursing features to surgical outcomes, it is not clear whether: 1) differences across hospitals in nursing resources are contributing to observed surgical disparities; 2) whether minority patients, because of differences in relative risk, are more sensitive to limited nursing resources; and 3) whether there are particular combinations of nursing resources that are most effective in reducing disparities. Our study will answer these questions. This application builds upon the successful scientific programs of two research teams: one with unique data and capabilities for evaluating the impact of nursing on surgical outcomes and disparities, and another which has pioneered Tapered Multivariate Matching methods to carefully control for differences in clinical risk between minority and white surgical patients in order to clearly identify the basis of outcomes disparities. We merge these two highly successful programs and combine novel Tapered Multivariate Matching approaches with unique new data on hospital nursing and surgical patient outcomes in over 700 hospitals in four large states to explicitly identify the conditions, in terms of nursing resources, that best serve to reduce surgical disparities. Our first aim is to determine whether and to what extent disparities in surgical outcomes (mortality, failure to rescue, readmissions, length of stay, intensive care use) between minority and white patients undergoing the exact same procedure result from: a) differences between minority and white patients themselves; and b) differences in nursing resources (including nurse education, staffing, skill mix, and the nurse work environment) and other characteristics (e.g., volume) of the often very different hospitals where minority and white patients predominantly receive care. Our second aim will allow us to identify if subpopulations of minority patients (e.g., high vs. low risk; specific procedure/comorbidity combinations) benefit more from specific nursing resource configurations. Our final aim will capitalize on panel data, spanning nearly a decade for over 700 hospitals and the patients in them, to determine whether changes in nursing are associated with changes in disparities—strengthening a case that associations we find in cross-sectional studies may be causal. Better evidence about the relationship between nursing and racial disparities in surgical outcomes can spur evidence-based interventions targeting modifiable aspects of nursing to reduce disparities. Project Narrative Our study focuses on a systems feature given little attention in research on racial disparities in surgical patient outcomes—differences in the nursing resources across hospitals. By using new multivariate matching methods to study patients in a large panel of hundreds of hospitals over nearly a decade, we will separately determine the effects of patient, surgeon, nursing, and hospital characteristics on racial disparities, closely examine the relationship between nursing and disparities in specific procedure and patient groups, and learn whether changes in nursing resources over time have had consequences for racial disparities in surgery outcomes. Our research can translate into interventions tailored to reduce surgical disparities by addressing the mismatch for some minority patients in terms of the specific nursing resources needed to yield the best outcomes.",The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes,9381237,R01MD011679,"['Accounting ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Attention ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospitals ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Caring ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' Relative Risks ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"Hispanic Role Models in Health Care Careers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers:  Empowering Hispanic Nurses to Leverage Traditional Spanish language and New Social Media to Inspire the Next Generation of Culturally Diverse  and Competent Health Care Professionals The National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN), in association with the Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), proposes to address the shortage of bilingual professionals in all health fields by recruiting and interviewing bilingual role models and arranging to broadcast those interviews nationwide. Leveraging HCN's nationally broadcast health education radio shows, whose cumulative audiences are larger than NPR's ""All Things Considered,"" this project has the potential to reach one out of every three US Hispanics during its first five years. This media campaign is intended to inspire Hispanic parents to encourage their children to study science and aspire to careers in the biomedical professions. It is also intended to inspire and empower Spanish-speaking adults from all walks of life to consider careers in the health professions. All broadcasts will tie to NAHN's interactive website so that students and adults interested in changing careers can find mentors and educational resources.         NAHN will also use YouTube, Facebook, mobile phone applications, and other new and popular social media technologies to reach a broad cross-section of English speaking youth and young adults.         In addition to the national media outputs, attendees at NAHN's annual conferences will have the opportunity to receive training in public speaking and media relations so they can more effectively use local media in their own communities to address health disparities and promote careers in the biomedical and health professions.         NAHN will develop a standardized, bilingual Toolkit for public presentations. The Toolkit will include a Powerpoint presentation embedded with video containing gender- and other- stereotype-busting role model interviews with Hispanic nurses; links to an online database of volunteer mentors; and a bilingual terminology packet that will aid nurses in creating linguistic and cognitive bridges between audience and professional knowledge bases. We expect that the refined Toolkit will empower nurses and other health professionals to become more effective public health educators and career role models during their presentations at community health events, career fairs, achievement clubs, and school assemblies.        An Advisory Committee of other health organizations, professionals, and advocates will recommend Role Models and provide periodic feedback.         Bilingual independent evaluators associated with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health will conduct qualitative and quantitative formative, iterative, and summative evaluations throughout the project. Their recommendations and findings will be incorporated into the project design and deliverables and shared with relevant fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers, a collaboration of the National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN) and Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), addresses the need for cultural and linguistic diversity among health professionals. HCN will broadcast interviews of Role Models on its 250 affiliated Spanish-language popular radio stations nationwide to inform Spanish-speakers about the range of health careers open to them with proper education and to inspire them to imagine themselves as successful professionals. This effort will be combined with the creation of a number of bilingual online resources for health career aspirants, including an extensive database of volunteer professionals who have said ""Si!Sere Mentor!""

"A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes More than 10 years since the Institute of Medicine's landmark Unequal Treatment report, racial and ethnic disparities in costly and often preventable poor outcomes persist for hospitalized older adults. Evidence points to differences in the hospitals where minorities and whites receive care as a source of disparities. Our original study findings suggest that nursing resource differences (nurse staffing, nurses' educational and skill levels, and nurse work environments) between hospitals may be an important factor underlying racial disparities. Our work thus far however has been restricted to cross-sectional data, preventing us from concluding whether the relationship between nursing resources and disparities is a causal one and whether interventions to improve nursing resources will work as intended. The study we propose in this renewal application takes the important next step to advance policy interventions by using new and unique panel data on hospital nursing and older adult patient outcomes in four large states to evaluate whether differences in outcomes between minority and white patients result from differences between minority and white patients, differences in nursing resources in the hospitals that minority and white patients receive care in, and/or differences in the care minority and white patients receive, even when they are treated in the same hospitals with similar nursing resources. We make efficient use of existing data from repeated cross-sections of hundreds of thousands of patients nested in a panel of over six hundred hospitals at two points in time. This provides a unique opportunity to examine well- known but poorly understood disparities from two distinct but complementary vantage points. First, by examining cross-sections spanning nearly a decade, we gain a better understanding of the role of individual and organizational factors in disparities in older adult hospital outcomes. Importantly, we will learn whether associations between nursing and outcomes disparities in 2015 are similar to those in the same hospital sample in 2006 and whether they differ for whites and minorities. Evidence supporting the stability of associations over time increases our warrant for concluding that connections are causal. Our second aim is to examine hospital-level changes in nursing resources over time, determine whether those changes differed for hospitals predominantly serving minority patients, and determine whether changes in outcomes disparities between minority and white patients result from changes in hospital nursing resources over time. It is important for causation and policy implications to know whether nursing resources improved less in minority serving hospitals. The panel data we will analyze will allow us to assess this, and to determine whether hospital outcomes disparities have grown (or narrowed) and whether nursing resource changes are linked with these changes. Furthermore, we will determine if the changes in nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has contributed to widening or reducing outcomes disparities between white and minority patients. Better causal evidence between nursing resources and patient outcomes can spur evidence-based decision-making. Project Narrative There is evidence that racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes for older adults are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By studying a large panel of hundreds of hospitals over nearly a decade, we will learn whether changes in hospital nursing resources have had consequences for disparities in quality of care and outcomes for hospitalized older adults. Understanding more about the causal links between investments in nursing and disparities in outcomes will inform how to target hospital investments in nursing to maximize safe, effective care for all patients.",A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes,9235410,R01AG041099,"['Accounting ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Decision Making ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Paper ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' protective effect ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' policy implication ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,330050,0.08448846356595224
"Impacts of payment reform on racial disparities in hospital psychiatric care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In July 2014, Maryland implemented a statewide hospital payment reform that includes global capitated budgeting to increase efficiency and performance incentives to improve quality. By encouraging hospitals to address the unmet needs of minority patients, this sweeping change has the potential to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in care coordination for individuals who are hospitalized as a result of a mental healt condition. However, such payment reforms, if not carefully designed, could incentivize ""safety-net"" hospitals, which provide access to psychiatric care in low-income minority urban communities, to offer fewer psychiatric services in order to reduce costs. In this study, hospitals administrative data are used in a non-experimental difference-in-difference-in-differences regression framework to examine the effects of the Maryland payment reform on racial-ethnic disparities in hospital-based psychiatric care at safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals. The study's primary outcomes are receipt of outpatient follow-up and transitional care management services after a psychiatric inpatient stay, hospital readmission, and hospital spending per patient for psychiatric services. These impacts are identified by comparing changes in Maryland (the intervention state) with changes in Pennsylvania (the comparison state) after, versus before, July 2014. This proposed study is significant and timely because it can inform policymakers' assessments of how similar ""value- based"" hospital payment reforms in other states can be designed to improve care for minority patients while preserving the psychiatric care safety-net in low-income minority communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although ""value-based"" health care payment reforms might reduce racial-ethnic disparities in health care coordination for individuals receiving psychiatric inpatient care, such payment reforms, if not carefully designed, could instead result in reduced access to psychiatric care services in predominantly low-income minority communities.

"Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K-07 award for Dr. Lisa Diamond, a clinician-investigator in the Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The applicant's long-term career goal is to contribute to the policy recommendations needed to eliminate healthcare disparities for cancer patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). Her research is aimed at understanding how clinician non- English language proficiency influences quality of care and outcomes for cancer patients with LEP. The work described in this proposal represents the first evidence-based approach to inform guidelines for the care of cancer patients with LEP. Dr. Diamond's background in health services research, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, through the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program positions her well to accomplish this. Through the proposed career development activities she seeks to gain additional skills towards achieving independence as a scientific investigator with a program of training in large database analysis and its relationship to policy formation, dissemination and implementation research, and the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a widely used rigorous method of coding medical interactions. True language concordance occurs when clinicians are fluent in the language that their patient speaks and reduces disparities among LEP patients. Partial language concordance may adversely impact the quality of cancer care provided to LEP patients. The applicant's research agenda is to gather the evidence to inform national and local standards for the appropriate use of non-English language skills by clinicians. Without standards, LEP cancer patients have the potential to misunderstand diagnoses and treatment recommendations, leading to treatment non- adherence.  Dr. Diamond proposes to accomplish this through the three aims in this career development award. First, she will identify the content of any existing policies on clinician use of non-English language skills and interpreters at hospitals that frequently serve cancer patients and to determine the factors associated with having such a policy. This will be accomplished by surveying the NCI-designated Cancer Centers nationally, the NCI Community Oncology Research Program sites, and minority-serving hospitals in New York City (NYC). Second, she will test the feasibility of using the RIAS across different languages to describe the nature of communication between clinicians and LEP cancer patients presenting for an initial visit at three minority- serving hospitals in NYC. Third, she will assess the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency, non- English language use, and interpreter use on completion of cancer treatment, quality of life, depression, and stress among a population of LEP cancer patients at the same 3 hospitals participating in Aim 2. Through the proposed career development and research activities, the applicant seeks to acquire new skills and knowledge that will complement her existing research abilities in order to improve cancer care to patients with LEP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since many clinicians who provide language concordant care are not native speakers of their patients' languages, studies are needed to help understand the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency on quality of cancer care for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). There are no national or state guide- lines to direct a clinician's decision to use his/her non-English language skills or a professional interpreter with LEP patients. It is critical to gather the evidence for standards addressing when it is acceptable to use one's own non-English language skills with LEP cancer patients and when professional interpreters are essential.",Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care,9241392,K07CA184037,"['Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Wood ', ' Wood material ', ' Work ', ' Diamond ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Competence ', ' Roter ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' skills ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' MSKCC ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Scholars Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' treatment trial ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K07,2017,180036,0.030384904507675333
"Unintended Consequences:  Medicare Performance Programs and Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the healthcare landscape has undergone transformational changes, through public reporting of hospital performance, promotion of medical homes, and development of global payment mechanisms, all directed at improved quality and value of care. To accelerate and solidify this process, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 mandated two programs of performance-based financial incentives covering a majority of hospitals nationwide: the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) and the Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program. Beginning in 2012, the programs incentivized an increase (""reward"") or decrease (""penalty"") in Medicare reimbursement rates based on hospital performance on a range of measures - readmissions, process of care, patient experience of care, mortality - some covering all patients and others covering patients with acute admissions for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia.  Although intended to encourage evaluation and improvement of quality-of-care processes, these programs have raised considerable concern for potential adverse impact in hospitals that care for disproportionately large share of racial and ethnic minorities (""minority-serving hospitals"") or uninsured and underinsured patients (""safety-net hospitals""). First, evidence indicates that patient outcomes, such as readmissions, are affected by factors beyond the influence of hospital processes, including access to outpatient care, and family and social supports; consequently, HRRP and VBP, using hospital benchmarks that make no allowance for differences in patient socio-demographic or clinical severity profiles, may lead to higher risk of penalties for minority-serving and safety-net hospitals. Second, as minority-serving and safety-net hospitals provide more uncompensated care, leading to greater reliance on public subsidies, their investments for quality-of-care improvements are likely to be smaller; to compound this challenge, financial penalties from the Medicare programs may have a greater adverse impact for patient care and outcomes in the resource-poor hospitals due to their low operating margins.  To evaluate these concerns, the proposed study aims to examine data from the implementation experience of these programs. Using Medicare patient-level and hospital-level data (2008-2015), and a difference-in-differences study design based on comparison of hospitals exposed to the programs with those not exposed, we aim to estimate program effects on (a) hospital performance, and (b) patient outcomes - 30- day mortality and readmission - by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. In addition, we will explore alternative modifications in performance programs to incentivize safety-net and minority-serving hospitals to improve quality of care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 2012, as mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare began implementation of two programs - the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and the Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program - that reward/penalize hospitals based on performance on process of care, patient experience, and outcomes. This has raised concern for hospitals that serve a larger share of racial/ethnic minority and low income patients, due to the higher associated risk of poor patient outcomes and lower compensation for patient care. Using data on rewards and penalties following the implementation of the two programs, this study aims to measure the program impact (a) on the quality of care in minority-serving and safety-net hospitals, and (b) on patient outcomes by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.",Unintended Consequences:  Medicare Performance Programs and Health Disparities,9248430,R01MD010527,"['Affect ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Assertiveness ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Uncompensated Care ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient safety ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' financial incentive ', ' family support ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,509748,0.058959852674679215
"Racial and SES disparities in Outcomes of Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program Project Summary/Abstract  In 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), which penalizes hospitals with more 30-day readmissions than expected for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), pneumonia (PNA), and, as of 2015, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and arthroplasty of the hip and knee. Policymakers hope that the HRRP will improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs because readmissions are common among older adults, costly, and associated with mortality and functional decline. Yet black and low-income seniors are more likely to be readmitted, experience adverse outcomes of hospitalization, be treated at hospitals with limited resources, receive lower quality care, have limited access to primary care physicians and specialists, and have adverse social circumstances that make transitioning from the hospital to home more difficult. In addition, hospitals may respond to the HRRP in favorable ways, such as by improving inpatient and transition-related care, or in less favorable ones, such as by increasing barriers to readmission. Consequently, the HRRP could inadvertently exacerbate disparities between black and low-income seniors and their white and higher-income peers.  This project will compare the effects of the HRRP on health outcomes (Aim One: mortality at 30, 60, and 180 days; and institutionalization at 180 days) and clinically important healthcare utilization (Aim Two: readmission, length of stay, emergency visits, observation stays, and use of formal post-acute care) between black vs. white, and Medicaid-dually-eligible vs. non-dually-eligible seniors. In addition, it will assess spillover effects on hospital-wide all-cause unplanned readmissions for black and dually-eligible seniors vs. their white and non-dually-eligible peers. Finally, the study will examine the extent to which the characteristics of the hospitals that seniors use and the neighborhoods where they reside explain disparities in the effects of the HRRP (Aim Three).  The investigators will study episodes of care associated with hospitalizations for the conditions targeted by the policy that occur during baseline, and anticipation, and implementation periods, using an interrupted time- series analysis based on patient- and provider-level Medicare administrative data and other data sources. Econometric models will test for deviations in time trends for health and utilization outcome measures between the baseline vs. anticipation and implementation periods, adjust for patient-level control variables, and absorb hospital-level fixed effects.  In addition to assessing the HRRP's effects on disparities in health outcomes that are important to older adults, the study will use simulation models enabling results to be reported in a format that is easy for policymakers and stakeholders to understand. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health Black and low-income elders tend to have worse health outcomes after hospitalization, and are readmitted more often than white and higher-income elders. The Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program penalizes hospitals when more patients than expected are readmitted after hospitalization for common heart problems or pneumonia. This study examines whether the Program increases or decreases disparities in health outcomes and clinically important healthcare utilization among blacks relative to whites, and lower- income relative to higher income elders.",Racial and SES disparities in Outcomes of Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program,9364258,R01HS025394,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,398878,0.002133399653260639
"Organizational Determinants of ICU Telemedicine Effectiveness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment in an ICU staffed by appropriately trained intensivist clinicians improves survival in critically ill patients. Yet many patients lack access o this level of critical care, particularly in small hospital and rural geographic areas, leading to excess mortality and creating significant socioeconomic disparities. To address this problem many hospitals have adopted ICU telemedicine, a health care delivery innovation which uses audio---visual technology to provide critical care services from a distance. By expanding access to high-quality critical care, ICU telemedicine has great potential to improve survival in critical illness. However, the success of telemedicine is hindered by critical deficiencies in our understanding of how and where this technology is best applied. Telemedicine is a complex intervention, and existing programs vary significantly in both the components of intervention and the clinical setting in which it is used. In turn, studies of telemedicine demonstrate mixed result, with some showing a large mortality benefit and others showing no benefit or even suggesting harm. As a result, decision makers have little guidance regarding how and where to use this potentially transformative technology, if at all. In this project we will address this knowledge ga by identifying the key clinical and organizational factors associated with ICU telemedicine effectiveness. Our central hypothesis is that objective, measurable, clinical and organizational factors will distinguish effective programs from ineffective ones. First, we will use national data on Medicare beneficiaries and an innovative risk--- adjustment procedure to quantify hospital---level variation in the impact of ICU telemedicine on patient mortality, ranking each hospital that has adopted ICU telemedicine from most effective to least effective. Second, we will conduct site visits at five hospitals with the greatest telemedicine effect and five hospitals with least telemedicine effect; along with two site visits at hospitals that have stopped using ICU telemedicine; performing in-depth qualitative analyses to identify the clinical and organizational factors associated with ICU telemedicine effectiveness. Third, we will develop and field a survey of all US hospitals that have adopted ICU telemedicine, linking the survey back to patient---level outcomes data and quantitatively defining ICU telemedicine clinical and organizational ""best practices"". By shifting the paradigm of ICU telemedicine evaluation away from whether it works to how and where it works best, this project will be the first rigorous examination of the factors that define successful ICU telemedicine implementation. Ultimately, these results will provide clinicians, hospital administrators with immediate, actionable data about how to use ICU telemedicine most effectively and efficiently, directly leading to improved access to critical care and improved survival for critically ill patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Between 4 and 7 million patients are admitted to an intensive care unit in the United States each year, and one---fifth of all Americans will die during a hospitalization that involves intensive care. By identifying the ways to best implement telemedicine in the ICU, this project will provide will provide clinicians, researchers and policy makers with important tools to expand access to high quality critical care and improve survival in patients with critical illness, particularly in small hospitals and rural areas.",Organizational Determinants of ICU Telemedicine Effectiveness,9277535,R01HL120980,"['Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Measurable ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Site Visit ', ' Monitor ', ' beneficiary ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,550224,0.04129571322035079
"Predicting rehabilitation outcomes in bilingual aphasia using computational modeling Bilingualism is an exponentially increasing trend in today's world population due to mass immigration and globalization. Nonetheless, there are no guidelines for the optimal rehabilitation for bilingual patients with aphasia, and this poses a great challenge to reducing health disparities. One of NIDCD's Health Disparities 2009-2013 Strategic Research Plan includes a goal to better treat aphasia in bilingual individuals (http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/plans/strategic/pages/FY2009-13-HDplan.aspx). The current research on this topic, however, lacks specific recommendations on which languages should be trained in a bilingual aphasic individual and to what extent cross-language transfer occurs subsequent to rehabilitation. Factors contributing to the paucity of research in this area relate to the multitude of possible language combinations in a bilingual individual, the relative competency of the two languages of the bilingual individual and the effect of focal brain damage on bilingual language representation. It is, however, unfeasible to examine these issues without undertaking a large scale longitudinal study in this population. As a potential solution, in our previous work, we developed a computational model to simulate language recovery following rehabilitation in bilingual aphasia. Specifically, we trained, lesioned, and retrained a bilingual computational model in order to systematically characterize the effect of AoA, pre-stroke language proficiency, and post-stroke naming output on the rehabilitation outcomes. Results demonstrated that a computational model including these variables was able to capture the many complex profiles that surface in aphasia both before and after intervention. In addition, it was able to predict the extent of cross-language generalization. However, the work of using this model to fully understand bilingual aphasia rehabilitation has just begun. In the proposed project, we extend this work to now examine the predictive abilities of the model and identify the factors that can maximize cross-language generalization. We also extend the architecture and functionality of this model, which was originally developed to simulate Spanish-English bilingual language processing, to Chinese-English which is another language combination commonly encountered in the US and has a strong theoretical and experimental foundation in computational modeling. The proposed work is innovative, because it uses a computational model to predict optimal rehabilitation protocols to facilitate the greatest amount of language recovery in bilingual aphasia. The successful completion of this project is expected to have an important impact on rehabilitation of stroke and bilingual aphasia as well as on the applications of computational modeling. This project is important because it will address the important issue of language recovery following treatment in individuals with bilingual aphasia by using a computational model to predict treatment outcomes in patients. It is predicted that the patients who are treated based on the model's predictions will outperform patients who are trained in the language opposite to the model's predictions, because each treatment plan is customized to that patient's impairment and bilingual language profile. This project will also provide a computational explanation for the hypothesis that different patterns of cross-language generalization in bilingual patients arise from facilitation and inhibition mechanisms on the computational maps. Finally, we will expand the architecture and functionality of the model from Spanish-English to Chinese-English to account for a different language structure. One of NIDCD's Health Disparities 2009-2013 Strategic Research Plan includes a goal to better treat aphasia in bilingual individuals.

"Effects of Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model on Racial Disparities in Lower Extremity Joint Replacements Project Summary Hip and knee replacements improve function and quality of life for people with severe arthritis, yet there have been long-standing racial disparities in the use and outcomes of these surgeries. Black Americans are about 40-50% less likely to receive hip or knee replacements (also called lower extremity joint replacements, or LEJR) than whites. Even if they receive LEJR, black patients are more likely to have complications leading to readmissions or death. Despite national awareness of this issue, this disparity persists. In April 2016, Medicare implemented the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, a program that may substantially affect racial disparities in LEJR. The CJR, Medicare's first mandatory bundled payment program, represents an ambitious attempt to move away from the predominant fee-for-service system with the potential to serve as a model for future payment systems. Under CJR, hospitals are accountable for the cost of care for 90 days after patients with LEJR are discharged. An innovative component of CJR is that it is being implemented in 67 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). This design provides a unique opportunity to estimate the causal effect of this payment reform. The CJR program may have a profound effect on racial disparities. CJR does not adjust for patients' socioeconomic status when they set target payment rates. This may lead hospitals to avoid admitting LEJR patients with more complex social service needs during recovery. Since a disproportionately high percentage of those patients may be black, existing disparities in the receipt of LEJR could be exacerbated. On the other hand, once the decision is made to provide LEJR, hospitals and post-acute care providers under CJR face new incentives to work together to improve care coordination for high-needs patients. These changes may reduce racial disparities in post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Our proposed research makes use of the unique randomized design of the CJR program to assess its effects on black-white disparities in LEJR. Our central hypothesis is that CJR increases disparities in the receipt of LEJR, but reduces disparities in the quality of post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Specifically, this proposal aims to assess the effect of the CJR program on black-white disparities 1) in the receipt of LEJR, 2) in post-acute care following LEJR, and 3) in patient outcomes of LEJR. To assess the effects of the CJR program, we will use Medicare claims to conduct difference-in-difference-in- differences regressions to examine the effects of CJR on racial disparities at hospitals located in MSAs affected by CJR relative to hospitals in comparable MSAs elsewhere. Accomplishing these aims will provide critical knowledge for payment reforms designed to decrease racial disparities not only in LEJR but in health care more broadly. Project Narrative/Relevance Black-white disparities in the use and outcome of hip and knee replacements (lower extremity joint replacements or LEJR) have been a major public health concern. This project will assess whether the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model, Medicare's first mandatory bundled payment program, affects black-white disparities in the receipt of LEJR, the quality of post-acute care following LEJR, and patient outcomes of LEJR.",Effects of Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model on Racial Disparities in Lower Extremity Joint Replacements,9285678,R01MD011403,"['Affect ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Awareness ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' joint replacement ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Evaluation ', ' Surgical complication ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Recovery ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' metropolitan ', ' payment ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health system ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Medicare claim ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' ']",NIMHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,483500,0.01625994374790198

Based in the Department of Health Policy and Management in the Bloomberg School of Public Health, we promote and encourage health disparities research, training and community engagement using the resources of the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health, Medicine and Nursing. Over the next five years we propose to conduct three major research projects that primarily focus on interpersonal and community-level influences. The cross-cutting theme for these projects is “exploring and addressing the impact of place-based determinants in health disparities among African Americans.” We define place broadly as the physical/built environment, sociocultural environment, and the healthcare system. The physical/built environments include contextual/distal factors that influence outcomes such as household, neighborhood, and community level factors. Sociocultural environment includes family and community norms, social support, social networks, social connectedness, and segregation by race/ethnicity, rurality, socioeconomic status, and language. The healthcare system includes the influence of local healthcare market characteristics, the regulatory environment, and policy level factors.

"Rural-Urban Disparity in Post-Acute Care ABSTRACT  While age-adjusted mortality rates in rural and urban counties in the United States were similar during the 1970s and 1980s, over the last two decades mortality rates declined at a much faster rate in urban counties, resulting in a widening rural-urban survival gap. The factors contributing to this growing disparity remain largely unidentified, despite the fact that more than 23% of the fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare population resides in non-metropolitan, rural counties. This application explores how much of this gap can be explained by differences in how post-acute care (PAC) is delivered. Very little is known about discrepancies in the types of PAC resources available to Medicare beneficiaries living in urban and rural areas, such as the type of PAC setting in which they receive their care, the quality of that PAC provider, or drivers of variations in care. The absence of this information complicates efficient and informed hospital discharge planning for rural Medicare beneficiaries and policy efforts to ameliorate this growing disparity in health outcomes. The objective of this application is to assemble and analyze national data to assess rural-urban disparities in the availability, selection, utilization, and outcomes of PAC. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that rural PAC markets have fewer and lower quality PAC choices, and that these restricted options result in worse health outcomes, contributing to the widening rural-urban health gap. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work revealing that: 1) there is no rural-urban discrepancy in hospital mortality rates; 2) there is no rural-urban discrepancy in the predicted likelihood of mortality following live hospital discharge; 3) yet, a substantially lower proportion of rural beneficiaries are discharged with PAC, and 4) consistent with other studies, post-hospital-discharge mortality is higher in rural areas. To achieve this objective, we propose three aims. First, we will compare trends in the availability of different types of PAC in rural and urban markets and determine the relationship of these trends in PAC availability to age-adjusted mortality. Second, we will compare the selection of PAC settings between beneficiaries hospitalized in urban versus rural hospitals. Third, we will compare PAC outcomes, including mortality, hospital readmission, emergency department visits, and length of PAC use between beneficiaries discharged from urban versus rural hospitals. We propose to study fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with an acute hospitalization in 2012-14 for one of five tracer conditions: hip fracture, lower extremity joint replacement, congestive heart failure, COPD, and stroke, integrating Medicare enrollment, claims, and PAC resident assessment data. This study lays important groundwork for future studies on developing efficient ways to deliver home-based care for beneficiaries living in remote areas, improving care coordination between rural hospitals and PAC providers, and designing appropriate payment schemes for care providers and risk-bearing health insurers to deliver optimal care in rural markets. NARRATIVE  The proposed study examines rural-urban disparities in the availability, selection, utilization, and outcomes of post-acute care (PAC). Lower access to and quality of PAC may play a key role in the rapidly widening rural-urban gap in health outcomes. Our results will help hospitals and patients to make informed decisions about PAC selection and improve coordination between acute and post-acute care.",Rural-Urban Disparity in Post-Acute Care,9244403,R21AG053712,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' United States ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' joint replacement ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' rural planning ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' payment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Scheme ', ' trend ', ' Tracer ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' critical access hospital ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' evidence base ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural counties ', ' rural setting ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,192474,0.016885772253780816
"Bridges to the Doctorate in Nursing for Northeastern Ohio ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in the US have significant impact on the health of Americans. To successfully address health disparities requires increasing the number of scientists from the groups most commonly impacted by health disparities. As the largest group of health care professionals, nurses and nurse scientists have the potential to improve health disparities yet fewer than 2% of American RNs have PhDs. With the current national initiatives related to chronic diseases, the need for self-management, and ongoing health care reform to include team- based primary care, nurse scientists have the potential to make substantial and significant contributions to the science of improving health and to address health disparities. Yet there are too few nurse scientists, particularly from under-represented (UR) groups. The purpose of this project is to increase the number of nurse scientists from under-represented groups by providing a transitional program, bridging master's nursing students from Cleveland State University (CSU) and Ursuline College (UC) into the PhD program at the Frances Payne Bolton (FPB) School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University. Nursing, as a female predominant discipline, faces additional challenges in attaining PhDs beyond that faced by other scientific disciplines. Within MSN and PhD programs, there are increasing numbers of nurses from minority backgrounds, 29.3% and 27.7%, respectively. Despite this increased educational attainment, Schools of Nursing remain with too few nurse faculty from UR groups: fewer than 12% of nurse faculty come from minority backgrounds. The aims of the 5 year project are to: 1. Identify and recruit 5 cohorts of Bridges participants during their master's degree programs, one cohort (n = 4) in each year, and provide mentored research experience (years 1 through 5) 2. Provide joint mentoring by UC, CSU and FPB to Bridges participants (years 1 through 5) with a focus on identifying and addressing the gaps often experienced by students from UR groups to enhance retention and socialization into academic roles. 3. Admit Bridges student graduates from UC and CSU into PhD study at FPB/Case Western Reserve University. To accomplish these aims, have developed a plan to identify and recruit promising MSN students from UC and CSU who are in the MSN programs. We will select 2 students from CSU and 2 students from UC each year for a total of 20 students over the 5 year period. The Bridges students will then be assigned co-mentors, one from their MSN institution and one from FPB CWRU, and participate in paid mentored research experiences while they complete their MSNs. In addition, each cohort of 4 students will receive tailored programming to assist them in addressing needs and challenges that are specific to students from underrepresented groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nurse scientists can contribute to improvements in health disparities but there are too few nurse scientists from underrepresented groups. The intent of this program is to increase the number of nurse scientists by ""bridging"" students from MSN programs at Cleveland State University and Ursuline College into the PhD program in nursing at the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University. Bridges students will be provided paid research mentoring, targeted programming to assure their success and co-mentoring from both the MSN and PhD institutions.",Bridges to the Doctorate in Nursing for Northeastern Ohio,9353840,R25GM111515,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mentors ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Ohio ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Socialization ', ' Students ', ' Nursing Students ', ' Pupil Nurses ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' community college ', ' two year college ', ' junior college ', ' 2 year college ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' social inequality ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"A Data-driven Approach to Improve Nursing Workflow and Patient-centered Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care recognizes patients' desires, opinions, and preferences as equal in importance to those of healthcare professionals, and emphasizes the need to educate and empower patients to play an active role in their care. The achievement of patient-centered care is associated with increased patient and provider satisfaction, improved health outcomes, and reduced cost of care delivery (Caffarini, 2011; Silow-Carol et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2008). Furthermore, as health disparities continue to persist, patient-centered care offers underserved patients the individualized and tailored care necessary to attain positive health outcomes. As the providers who spend more time with patients than any other personnel, nursing staff are central to the provision of patient-centered care (De Lucia et al., 2009). However, most of these front-line providers are burdened by numerous non-value added tasks that not only distract from direct patient care activities, but also hamper their ability to implement best practices such as proven care plans for preventing adverse events (e.g., falls and pressure ulcers) among at-risk patients (Hendrich et al., 2008; Storfjell et al., 2008; Aiken et al., 2002). The occurrence of such preventable events is especially concerning in light of the fact that such events fall disproportionately on already underserved populations, including certain racial/ethnic communities, limited English speaking individuals, and the elderly (Divi et al., 2007; Metersky et al., 2011; Rothschild et al., 2000). Fr patient-centered care to be truly realized, the healthcare system must introduce process innovations that can streamline mundane, indirect tasks such as service documentation for front-line nursing care providers and enable them to efficiently adopt value added clinical practices that benefit direct patient care activities. In this project, we will engage several partners-including a skilled nursing facility that serves predominantly monolingual Spanish- and Chinese-speaking communities and a long-term care facility for retired veterans-to implement an advanced patient-nurse communication and nurse workflow optimization system. This solution will: (i) track comprehensive care plans and associated tasks for individual patients; (ii intelligently assign and alert each provider of his or her care plan tasks, escalating pending tasks to appropriate staff members to expedite completion; and (iii) offer real-time analysis of task fulfillment status and workflow patterns, providing decision support to both staff and managers for identifying factors that may undermine staff productivity or contribute to adverse events. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patient-centered care is associated with increased quality and satisfaction with health services, and has significant potential to improve health outcomes for communities that experience health disparities; however, numerous indirect and often burdensome tasks hinder most nurses from delivering truly patient-centered care. To increase time available for direct bedside patient interactions, this project will develop a patient-nurse communication and workflow optimization tool specifically for streamlining nursing care protocols. By offering nurses full visibility of their workload, efficient interactive checklists fr carrying out upcoming tasks, and low- burden documentation capabilities from virtually any location in the unit, this innovative system will empower nurses to reduce time spent on low-value, indirect care tasks and be better able to account for individual patients' communication needs, thereby transforming the care environment to support patient-centered care delivery and sustained improvement in patient outcomes.",A Data-driven Approach to Improve Nursing Workflow and Patient-centered Care,9312124,R44MD009581,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Video Display Terminals ', ' Computer Terminals ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community. The results of this investigation will also provide contemporary insights on how patients who experience heart attacks in the community are treated by physicians.",Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease,9395941,R01HL135219,"['Adoption ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration / HMO ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Reperfusion ', ' Coronary Reperfusion ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Practice Management ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Prevention ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' ICD-10 ', ' ICD-9 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Coronary ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Information Technology ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' population based ', ' surveillance data ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2018,803425,0.017566647793960458
"A Geographic Information System to Evaluate Disparities in Access to Emergency Surgery Services PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Emergency General Surgery (EGS) constitutes a significant public health burden in the United States. With approximately 3 million admissions a year, this subset of high-risk surgical conditions accounts for 50% of all surgical mortality, despite representing only 11% of surgical admissions. Timely access and presentation to facilities capable of rapid surgical intervention is critical for these conditions, as delays in care are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous research in EGS has identified rural, minority, uninsured and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations as having higher rates of advanced clinical presentation and worse EGS outcomes, raising concerns for disparities in access to emergency surgical services. While it is intuitive that geographic access to care plays a role in EGS outcomes, it is unclear to what degree it interacts with the above socio-demographic factors and contributes to these disparities. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the etiology of disparities in access to EGS. Our central hypothesis is that geographic access contributes to EGS outcomes through interactions with social, patient and disease-related factors in a manner which disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. We will address these hypotheses through the following Specific Aims: (1) We will first develop a national geographic information system to quantify disparities in access to EGS services. Using national census and hospital data, we will generate an interactive map of EGS-capable hospitals, and layer this with distributions of key populations of interest: rural, minority, uninsured and low-income individuals. We will then use advanced spatial modelling techniques to quantify disparities in access to EGS hospitals for these populations and identify regions in greatest need of enhanced surgical capacity. (2) Subsequently, we will combine clinical data with spatial models to determine the contribution of geographic access to disparities in EGS outcomes. Using mixed-effects regression modelling, we will evaluate to what extent improving geographic access would reduce the observed outcome disparities for vulnerable populations. The proposed research represents a novel application of GIS technology to surgical research. The use of geospatial modelling will provide important insight into how geographic access and resource distribution contribute to surgical disparities for time-sensitive EGS conditions. This approach will further enable us to identify specific regions and populations to target for intervention. Finally, the development of a national GIS platform holds potential to inform future EGS regionalization and planning efforts by ensuring equitable distribution of services for vulnerable populations. NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Emergency General Surgery (EGS) represents an important subset of high-risk surgical admissions in the United States, accounting for nearly 50% of all surgical deaths and $28 billion in costs annually; timely access to surgical care is critical for these conditions, as delays are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Disparities in EGS outcomes have been identified for rural, minority and uninsured populations, yet it remains unclear to what degree this is due to geographic access to EGS hospitals. This study will develop a national Geographic Information System to better understand how geographic access contributes to disparities in EGS outcomes for vulnerable populations, and will improve our ability to allocate surgical resources in an equitable manner.",A Geographic Information System to Evaluate Disparities in Access to Emergency Surgery Services,9502626,R21MD012657,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Censuses ', ' Critical Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health system plans ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obstruction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' tool ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Perforation ', ' Services ', ' surgical service ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' social ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Institution ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health emergency ', ' surgical research ', ' Systems Development ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2018,228750,0.021101254056610154
"Hispanic Role Models in Health Care Careers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers:  Empowering Hispanic Nurses to Leverage Traditional Spanish language and New Social Media to Inspire the Next Generation of Culturally Diverse  and Competent Health Care Professionals The National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN), in association with the Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), proposes to address the shortage of bilingual professionals in all health fields by recruiting and interviewing bilingual role models and arranging to broadcast those interviews nationwide. Leveraging HCN's nationally broadcast health education radio shows, whose cumulative audiences are larger than NPR's ""All Things Considered,"" this project has the potential to reach one out of every three US Hispanics during its first five years. This media campaign is intended to inspire Hispanic parents to encourage their children to study science and aspire to careers in the biomedical professions. It is also intended to inspire and empower Spanish-speaking adults from all walks of life to consider careers in the health professions. All broadcasts will tie to NAHN's interactive website so that students and adults interested in changing careers can find mentors and educational resources.         NAHN will also use YouTube, Facebook, mobile phone applications, and other new and popular social media technologies to reach a broad cross-section of English speaking youth and young adults.         In addition to the national media outputs, attendees at NAHN's annual conferences will have the opportunity to receive training in public speaking and media relations so they can more effectively use local media in their own communities to address health disparities and promote careers in the biomedical and health professions.         NAHN will develop a standardized, bilingual Toolkit for public presentations. The Toolkit will include a Powerpoint presentation embedded with video containing gender- and other- stereotype-busting role model interviews with Hispanic nurses; links to an online database of volunteer mentors; and a bilingual terminology packet that will aid nurses in creating linguistic and cognitive bridges between audience and professional knowledge bases. We expect that the refined Toolkit will empower nurses and other health professionals to become more effective public health educators and career role models during their presentations at community health events, career fairs, achievement clubs, and school assemblies.        An Advisory Committee of other health organizations, professionals, and advocates will recommend Role Models and provide periodic feedback.         Bilingual independent evaluators associated with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health will conduct qualitative and quantitative formative, iterative, and summative evaluations throughout the project. Their recommendations and findings will be incorporated into the project design and deliverables and shared with relevant fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Hispanic Role Models in Health Careers, a collaboration of the National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN) and Hispanic Communications Network (HCN), addresses the need for cultural and linguistic diversity among health professionals.

"Nursing Home Care Disparities for Hispanic Medicare Advantage and Fee-For-Service Beneficiaries with Alzheimers and Related Dimentias PROJECT SUMMARY Due to the growing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) among elder Hispanics, the Alzheimer’s Association has emphasized the importance of conducting research to learn more of this con- dition in the Hispanic population. Hispanics have been one of the fastest-growing minority groups among nurs- ing home residents while the number of White residents is decreasing. However, most studies about ADRD care for Hispanics have focused on family caregiving, with very little research about nursing home care. All of the prior research on the care and outcomes of patients with ADRD is derived from patients enrolled in tradi- tional Medicare, with remarkably few studies of persons with ADRD in managed care plans. Even though the Medicare Advantage (MA) program plays a critical role in financing and delivering care for older minorities, es- pecially Hispanics since approximately 40% are enrolled in MA. This raises a critical gap in knowledge be- cause over the past 12 years, the number of beneficiaries enrolled in managed care more than tripled from 5.3 million in 2004 to 17.6 million in 2016. MA plans, which are accountable for their clinical performance, have implemented strategies to improve care, either by selectively contracting with high-performing providers or di- rectly initiating care management strategies for those with complex health care needs. This could be the key to the delivery coordinated, patient-centered, and cost-effective care for people with ADRD. Whether the unique payment and organizational structure of managed care plans translates into differential use and outcomes of nursing home care for minority people with ADRD is unknown. The objective of this R03, the next step in this agenda, is to assess disparities among Hispanics in the quality of ADRD care in a national sample of Medicare enrollees in fee-for-service and MA plans. Our working hypotheses are that, among persons with ADRD, His- panics with ADRD would be more likely to receive care from lower quality long-term care providers, and that managed care would reduce disparities in quality of care. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. To evaluate the quality of nursing home care that serve newly admitted MA and Medicare fee-for-service Hispanic patients with ADRD compared to non-Hispanic whites with ADRD; and Aim 2. To characterize within- and between- nursing home’s disparities in short- and long-stay resident’s outcomes for Hispanics with ADRD. This project will use detailed comprehensive clinical and functional assessment data from all Medicare-certified nursing homes in the US. Our expectation is that this project will provide understanding of disparities in health care quality of formal nurs- ing home care for those with ADRD. Our results can inform Medicare policies that promote better quality of care for Hispanics by understanding the role of managed care plans in lowering racial-ethnic variations. Our contribution is significant since federal policy continues to promote beneficiaries’ enrollment in MA plans with- out evidence about the quality of care for vulnerable populations, such as Hispanics with ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is relevant to public health because it will provide important information on disparities regarding nursing home care for Hispanic Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Medicare Advantage plans integrate the financing and delivery of care, which may be the key to the delivery coordinated, patient-centered, and cost-effective care for people with ADRD. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to redress and identify mechanisms to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities.",Nursing Home Care Disparities for Hispanic Medicare Advantage and Fee-For-Service Beneficiaries with Alzheimers and Related Dimentias,9527967,R03AG054686,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Decision Making ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Incentives ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Managed Care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Policies ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' expectation ', ' payment ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' dual eligible ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' federal policy ', ' family care giving ', ' family caregiving ', ' dementia care ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,81250,0.02829005234285204

"Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes. The organization and practice of nursing have substantial positive effects on patient care and patient  outcomes. As a result of our NINR-sponsored research program continually funded since 1997, organization-based nursing interventions are now more often considered as potential solutions to poor quality and unsafe care. Organizational factors include nurse education, via preferential hiring practices  and educational benefits to employees~ nurse staffing, an evolving ""industry standard"" that has been the  focus of legislation~ human resource policies which determine nursing skill mix~ and the nursing work  environment-the organizational practices fostering the autonomy and authority required for nurses to  translate their education and experience into effective nursing care. In large, multi-state surveys of US nurses conducted in 1999 and in 2006, we have applied innovative sampling, aggregation, and measurement methods to provide rich information on nursing never before available for large numbers of  healthcare organizations that is linked to patient outcomes to document the empirical relationship between  nursing and outcomes. These data have been used to answer a range of compelling practice and policy questions about the contributions of nurses to safe, effective care. This application is an efficient, innovative extension of our line of research creating a large study of the impact of change in nursing factors on outcomes, seeking to determine more about causality in order to spur implementation of recommendations emerging from research. We will replicate in 2014 measurements made in 2006 (and 1999 in Pennsylvania) across approximately 665 hospitals and hundreds of nursing homes and home care agencies in four large states with measurement before and after the national economic downturn and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The great strength of the application is that in creating a panel of organizational observations, we can see where change has occurred and why. Specific aims are to: 1)  Collect data from random samples of nurses in CA, FL, NJ, and PA~ 2) Examine organizational-level  changes over time in nurse inputs in (a) education, (b) staffing, (c) skill mix, and (d) work environment  between 1999, 2006, and 2014~ 3) Estimate the effects of organizational-level changes on outcomes for  patients including minorities and those with chronic illnesses and determine whether lesser improvement in  nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has widened the disparity in outcomes between white and  minority patients~ and 4) Determine the effects of nursing factors in nursing home and home health agency  patient outcomes while accounting for variation in patient clinical severity and complexity.  The overarching aim of the proposed study is to determine points of comparatively low-cost organizational leverage of nursing inputs to improve patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In studying health care organizations over time, we learn what kinds of changes in nursing resources have occurred and thus are possible, and the consequences of changes for quality of care and patient outcomes.  Understanding more about the causal links between investments in nursing and patient outcomes will inform healthcare organizations about how to target their nursing investments to maximize safe, effective care for patients.",Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes,9756724,R01NR014855,"['Accounting ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Environment ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Methods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Privatization ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Home Care Agencies ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' nursing intervention ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' nursing skill ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' human capital ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' policy implication ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' Industry Standard ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,406403,0.12553701233103734

"The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 10 million Americans are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These dual-eligibles are a disproportionately high-cost population with substantial and often unmet healthcare needs. They are also more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and experience potentially-preventable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits resulting from disparities in access to primary care. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between primary care access and the broader continuum of potentially-preventable hospital care, which includes not only ED visits and hospitalizations, but also observation stays, 30-day return ED visits, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are “safety net” providers that receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations without regard for patients' ability to pay. FQHCs are known to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and quality, but dual-eligibles' use of FQHCs has not been well studied. Moreover, modifiable organizational characteristics that may explain variations in FQHC performance related to reducing disparities are not well understood. Thus, the objective of this study is to characterize and evaluate the role of FQHCs in providing primary care that lowers rates of—and reduces racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care among dual-eligibles. The proposed study has three specific aims: 1) To determine the extent to which FQHCs reduce hospital care relative to receiving care from other primary care providers; 2) To determine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in hospital care are reduced among FQHC users relative to those receiving care from other primary care providers; and 3) To determine the extent to which organizational characteristics enhance the ability of FQHCs to reduce hospital care and related racial/ethnic disparities in care. Using seven years of Medicare claims data (2012 – 2018) rates of—and disparities in—hospital care will be modeled as a function of FQHC use and other primary care sources. The extent to which disparities exist within or between FQHCs will also be assessed. Finally, FQHC-specific hospital care rates will be modeled as a function of FQHC characteristics using Medicare claims and FQHC data from the Uniform Data System. The proposed study is significant, because it will provide evidence of the relative effectiveness of FQHCs at lowering rates of—and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care and identify modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices. The proposed study is innovative because it is the first to examine the relationship between FQHC use and racial/ethnic disparities in the broader continuum of hospital care among dual-eligibles using quasi-experimental methods (i.e., instrumental variable and difference-in-differences analyses) to address selection bias, and the first to model organizational disparities in hospital care rates across FQHCs as a function of FQHC characteristics. This study is expected to have an immediate positive impact for CMS policymakers, state Medicaid agencies, providers (particularly FQHCs), hospitals, and dual-eligible patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to further our understanding of how to use federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to improve access to primary care and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in costly and potentially-preventable hospital care among the dual-eligible population. Moreover, by identifying modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices, the proposed research has the potential to inform improvements in care delivery at low-performing FQHCs. The project is relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities because it focuses on understanding how FQHCs can be used to improve access to care and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities among dual-eligibles.",The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles,9487311,R01MD011513,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Funding ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Modeling ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2018,368928,0.006654268418880105
"Effects of Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model on Racial Disparities in Lower Extremity Joint Replacements Project Summary Hip and knee replacements improve function and quality of life for people with severe arthritis, yet there have been long-standing racial disparities in the use and outcomes of these surgeries. Black Americans are about 40-50% less likely to receive hip or knee replacements (also called lower extremity joint replacements, or LEJR) than whites. Even if they receive LEJR, black patients are more likely to have complications leading to readmissions or death. Despite national awareness of this issue, this disparity persists. In April 2016, Medicare implemented the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, a program that may substantially affect racial disparities in LEJR. The CJR, Medicare's first mandatory bundled payment program, represents an ambitious attempt to move away from the predominant fee-for-service system with the potential to serve as a model for future payment systems. Under CJR, hospitals are accountable for the cost of care for 90 days after patients with LEJR are discharged. An innovative component of CJR is that it is being implemented in 67 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). This design provides a unique opportunity to estimate the causal effect of this payment reform. The CJR program may have a profound effect on racial disparities. CJR does not adjust for patients' socioeconomic status when they set target payment rates. This may lead hospitals to avoid admitting LEJR patients with more complex social service needs during recovery. Since a disproportionately high percentage of those patients may be black, existing disparities in the receipt of LEJR could be exacerbated. On the other hand, once the decision is made to provide LEJR, hospitals and post-acute care providers under CJR face new incentives to work together to improve care coordination for high-needs patients. These changes may reduce racial disparities in post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Our proposed research makes use of the unique randomized design of the CJR program to assess its effects on black-white disparities in LEJR. Our central hypothesis is that CJR increases disparities in the receipt of LEJR, but reduces disparities in the quality of post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Specifically, this proposal aims to assess the effect of the CJR program on black-white disparities 1) in the receipt of LEJR, 2) in post-acute care following LEJR, and 3) in patient outcomes of LEJR. To assess the effects of the CJR program, we will use Medicare claims to conduct difference-in-difference-in- differences regressions to examine the effects of CJR on racial disparities at hospitals located in MSAs affected by CJR relative to hospitals in comparable MSAs elsewhere. Accomplishing these aims will provide critical knowledge for payment reforms designed to decrease racial disparities not only in LEJR but in health care more broadly. Project Narrative/Relevance Black-white disparities in the use and outcome of hip and knee replacements (lower extremity joint replacements or LEJR) have been a major public health concern.

"The Impact of Cardiac Care Regionalization on Access, Treatment, and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Coronary heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is the leading cause of death in the United States. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a common and particularly severe form of AMI for which timely access to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is essential to good patient outcomes. In an attempt to improve outcomes for STEMI patients, STEMI regionalization systems have been established at the local and state level across the United States to quickly route or transfer STEMI patients to a hospital with PCI capability. However, no studies of this relatively new healthcare system have been able to show if and how regionalization has improved access and mortality at the community level, as prior work has been limited by studies done in single-hospital settings, the evaluation of only certain process outcomes, and the lack of inclusion of a control group to account for secular trends in improved mortality.  Our goals in this proposal are 3-fold: (1) to determine to what extent regionalized STEMI systems are associated with improvements in both access and outcomes, (2) whether vulnerable communities benefit equally within the same system, and (3) how distance and time differentially affect these outcomes. To accomplish these goals, we propose an innovative and definitive approach to study California, a state that provides a natural experiment of STEMI regionalization, as 47% of its population has resided in counties that have regionalized at different times over the study period. We will use a difference-in-differences approach and link non-public patient discharge data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development from 2006 through 2012 (≈90K STEMI patients) with a database designed by the PI of regionalization status of each county over the same period. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which overall access (defined by admission to PCI-capable hospital), treatment (receipt of PCI), and health outcomes differ for STEMI patients in regionalized vs. non-regionalized communities. We hypothesize that the change in probability of being admitted to a PCI-equipped hospital and of receiving PCI will be appreciably higher in counties experiencing regionalization than non-regionalized counties and that health outcomes will improve. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes have changed for STEMI patients in regionalized vs. non-regionalized communities. We hypothesize that STEMI patients who belong to traditionally underserved populations will have larger improvements in these metrics post-regionalization relative to the reference population. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which changes in access, treatment, and outcome differ for STEMI patients according to distance and time horizon following regionalization. We hypothesize that STEMI patients living farther away from regional PCI centers will benefit differentially more than those living closer to regional PCI centers, and benefits of regionalization may not be seen until 1-2 years post-implementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Clinicians and policymakers face decisions about whether to fundamentally restructure care networks in order to improve care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). These changes are often expensive, require massive organizational changes, and could have unintended adverse consequences. Little evidence is available to evaluate the effect of implementing these regional systems, particularly how they affect vulnerable populations. This project will inform future regionalization efforts on other health issues currently being debated and have collateral benefits on the approach to other organizational changes and their evaluation by creating a template for future efforts. This opportunity to study one particular strategy offers insight into how ongoing reorganization and re-design of health care systems affects patient outcomes.","The Impact of Cardiac Care Regionalization on Access, Treatment, and Outcomes",9521844,R01HL134182,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' plan health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Masks ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Veins ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Process Measure ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' LGALS3BP gene ', ' MAC-2-BP ', ' 90K ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' percutaneous coronary intervention ', ' database design ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' patient population ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,554058,0.02143953786285616
"Profiles and Progress in Spanish English Bilinguals with Language Impairment: Development of a Criterion Reference Measure PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY We have made significant gains in the correct classification of Spanish-English bilinguals with language impairment though the identification of clinical markers of impairment. Yet a hurdle in reducing the health disparities associated with language impairment in bilingual populations is the need to establish developmental milestones that can serve as the foundation for goal setting and evaluation of progress as a function of language intervention. We know that experiential factors (age of acquisition and language use) interact with bilingual language outcomes. But we do not have a detailed picture of qualitative and quantitative differences between bilingual children with language impairment and their typically developing peers in the semantics and morphosyntax domains. The proposed project will translate the knowledge base regarding clinical markers of impairment, experiential factors, and knowledge of the linguistic systems of English and Spanish to the development of a clinical tool. The focus of the tool is to benchmark language learning in bilingual children growing up in the US context. Thus, the major aim of this project is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and set of probes in Spanish and English. These will be useful for intervention planning and to measure change as a function of language intervention. This tool will target 4-10 year old Spanish English bilinguals with and without language impairment. We will achieve this aim by 1) developing and evaluating an extension of our existing item set; 2) conducting an item tryout study to establish an item set for testing semantic and morphosyntactic performance profiles; and 3) field testing and validating a inventory and probes for profiling patterns of mastery in bilingual children with language impairment that is normed to account for age and language experience. To achieve these milestones, we will recruit 1200 bilingual children between the ages of 4 and 10 years of age from representative U.S. bilingual populations both in regard to dialect and SES. Using a modified matrix model, children will complete a battery of test items that tap key aspects of lexical-semantic and grammatical knowledge in English and Spanish. To make this tool maximally useful in clinical settings, we will program the task to be delivered by computer so that appropriate targets are selected based on the child's age and language experience and that sufficient targets are administered to accurately establish mastery and non-mastery. This research will form the foundation of a clinical tool that can be used by clinicians to establish goals and to document progress as a function of language intervention. This work will further our research in language impairment, especially with bilingual children, because we will document a broad profile of lexical semantic and morphosyntactic skills over a wider age range than is usually studied. The tools developed will also be useful for researchers who need to benchmark children's performance in developmental and intervention studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and probes of Spanish and English development for planning and measuring progress in language intervention. We will translate information about identifying language impairment in Spanish English bilinguals and the relationship between language experience and language growth to develop an item set for identifying patterns of mastery and non mastery of grammatical and lexical semantic targets in 4 to 10 year old bilinguals. This tool that will help clinicians develop and track progress in language invention. Researchers will benefit because it will allow them to benchmark development and test the outcomes of language interventions.",Profiles and Progress in Spanish English Bilinguals with Language Impairment: Development of a Criterion Reference Measure,9483277,R01DC015588,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Computers ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rice ', ' Schools ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Development Plans ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Performance ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ten years of age ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' 10 years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' lexical ', ' English Language Learner ', ' English Learner ', ' invention ', ' Developmental Course ', ' language impairment ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2018,678015,0.05510729246450256
"Bilingual and Socio-Emotional Development in Dual Language Learners The U.S. population of dual language learners (DLLs), or children who are exposed to and learning through two languages, has grown rapidly in the last decade. DLLs from low-income families lag significantly behind their monolingual English-speaking peers on school readiness measures at kindergarten entry, and the achievement gap continues to widen with age. Despite the critical role of socio-emotional development (SED) in children's long-term health and achievement, significant gap exists in our knowledge on how bilingual experience shapes SED. By integrating the assessment methods on language, executive functions, and SED, this R01 takes an interdisciplinary approach to study the reciprocal relations between bilingual (English and heritage language) development and SED in a longitudinal study. We will follow 400 DLLs (50% females, initially 3-4 years of age) from low-income Spanish-speaking Mexican American families (N = 200) and Cantonese-speaking Chinese American families (N = 200) annually for three years (T1 and T2 in preschool, T3 in kindergarten). Three waves of multi-method and multi-context data on children's English and heritage language proficiency, executive functions, SED, and quality of parent-child and teacher-child relationships will be collected to address the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the contributions of early English and heritage language development to DLLs' later SED, and test executive functions as a mediating mechanism; 2) Examine the contributions of early bilingual development to DLLs' parent-child and teacher-child relationships, and test relationship quality as mediators between language and SED; 3) Examine cultural differences in DLLs' social relationships, and test whether culture moderates the links between language and relationships; and 4) Test whether other child, family, and school factors moderate the relations between language and SED. The proposed research will contribute to the scientific knowledge on the linking of development across domains (language, executive function, and SED), and have implications for early childhood education policy, assessment, curriculum development, teacher training, and family engagement practice on DLLs. The goal of the study is to examine the bidirectional influences between bilingual (English and heritage language) development and socio-emotional development among dual language learners (DLLs) from low- income Spanish- and Chinese-speaking families. Despite the rapid growth of DLLs in the U.S., the socio- emotional development of young DLLs has been largely ignored. The proposed work will further our understanding of the interconnections among bilingualism, executive functions, and socio-emotional development and could have implications for early childhood education policy, assessment, curriculum, teacher training, and family engagement practice on DLLs.",Bilingual and Socio-Emotional Development in Dual Language Learners,9445345,R01HD091154,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Language ', ' Chinese American ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Temperament ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Policies ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' metropolitan ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' peer ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' kindergarten ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' rapid growth ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' 4 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' evidence base ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' curriculum development ', ' minority children ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' cognitive benefits ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,620476,0.05691078914910996
"System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care  Over the past decade, the proportion of minority older adults residing in nursing homes (NHs) has increased dramatically and is projected to surpass that of white adults by 2030.1 NHs account for 68% of the $72 billion spent on long-term care in 2008 with most of it funded by Medicaid. These demographic and financial realities create an urgency to understand the needs of minorities in NHs and how systems organization and care delivery in NHs operate to ensure that minority residents maintain quality of life (QoL) and receive quality of care (QoC) equitable to white residents. QoL is a patient-centered measure that captures social, psychological, and environmental well-being. QoC typically consists of staff-reported indicators of care delivery and its related to clinical outcomes (e.g., pressure ulcers). Racial disparities exist in certain QoC indicators, and our recent work for the first time found racial disparities in NH resident QoL. However, those disparities were not based on individual race/ethnicity, but reflected system-wide factors affecting NHs that served more minority residents. Some of these factors are not amenable to intervention, including location of high-minority proportion NHs in poorer areas. There is a need to identify modifiable system-wide mechanisms for these disparities to craft interventions that address them.  Our long-term goal is to develop an intervention for improving QoL for minority NH residents nationwide. To build toward that goal, we designed a multi-method study to examine organizational structures and processes of care in NHs with high and low proportions of minorities, and then assess system-level predictors of NH QoL (primary outcome) and QoC (secondary outcomes) in a unique state-level database with more granular measures as well as a nationally-representative database. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1: Assess and compare, via qualitative methods, the structural, cultural, and process factors influencing QoL and QoC for minority residents among NHs with high, moderate, and low proportions of minority residents. Aim 2: Determine the effect of system-level factors on racial/ethnic differences in NH QoL(primary) and QoC (secondary outcome) using a unique statewide dataset. Aim 3: Using national data from all licensed NHs in the US, test the effect of system-level predictors on racial differences in QoL (primary) and QoC (secondary outcome). Narrative Despite the increase in use of nursing home services by racial/ethnic minority groups, we know little about the needs of minorities in these settings. This project will examine modifiable system- wide mechanisms for nursing home resident quality of care and quality of care for minority older adults. We will use a mixed-methods design with state and national data.  ",System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care,9465241,R01MD010729,"['Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' rurality ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Communities ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,331783,0.016189992675890604
"Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K-07 award for Dr. Lisa Diamond, a clinician-investigator in the Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The applicant's long-term career goal is to contribute to the policy recommendations needed to eliminate healthcare disparities for cancer patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). Her research is aimed at understanding how clinician non- English language proficiency influences quality of care and outcomes for cancer patients with LEP. The work described in this proposal represents the first evidence-based approach to inform guidelines for the care of cancer patients with LEP. Dr. Diamond's background in health services research, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, through the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program positions her well to accomplish this. Through the proposed career development activities she seeks to gain additional skills towards achieving independence as a scientific investigator with a program of training in large database analysis and its relationship to policy formation, dissemination and implementation research, and the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a widely used rigorous method of coding medical interactions. True language concordance occurs when clinicians are fluent in the language that their patient speaks and reduces disparities among LEP patients. Partial language concordance may adversely impact the quality of cancer care provided to LEP patients. The applicant's research agenda is to gather the evidence to inform national and local standards for the appropriate use of non-English language skills by clinicians. Without standards, LEP cancer patients have the potential to misunderstand diagnoses and treatment recommendations, leading to treatment non- adherence.  Dr. Diamond proposes to accomplish this through the three aims in this career development award. First, she will identify the content of any existing policies on clinician use of non-English language skills and interpreters at hospitals that frequently serve cancer patients and to determine the factors associated with having such a policy. This will be accomplished by surveying the NCI-designated Cancer Centers nationally, the NCI Community Oncology Research Program sites, and minority-serving hospitals in New York City (NYC). Second, she will test the feasibility of using the RIAS across different languages to describe the nature of communication between clinicians and LEP cancer patients presenting for an initial visit at three minority- serving hospitals in NYC. Third, she will assess the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency, non- English language use, and interpreter use on completion of cancer treatment, quality of life, depression, and stress among a population of LEP cancer patients at the same 3 hospitals participating in Aim 2. Through the proposed career development and research activities, the applicant seeks to acquire new skills and knowledge that will complement her existing research abilities in order to improve cancer care to patients with LEP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since many clinicians who provide language concordant care are not native speakers of their patients' languages, studies are needed to help understand the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency on quality of cancer care for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). There are no national or state guide- lines to direct a clinician's decision to use his/her non-English language skills or a professional interpreter with LEP patients. It is critical to gather the evidence for standards addressing when it is acceptable to use one's own non-English language skills with LEP cancer patients and when professional interpreters are essential.",Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care,9447132,K07CA184037,"['Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' Work ', ' Diamond ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Competence ', ' Roter ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' skills ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' MSKCC ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Scholars Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' treatment trial ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K07,2018,180036,0.030384904507675333
"Predicting rehabilitation outcomes in bilingual aphasia using computational modeling Bilingualism is an exponentially increasing trend in today's world population due to mass immigration and globalization. Nonetheless, there are no guidelines for the optimal rehabilitation for bilingual patients with aphasia, and this poses a great challenge to reducing health disparities. One of NIDCD's Health Disparities 2009-2013 Strategic Research Plan includes a goal to better treat aphasia in bilingual individuals (http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/plans/strategic/pages/FY2009-13-HDplan.aspx). The current research on this topic, however, lacks specific recommendations on which languages should be trained in a bilingual aphasic individual and to what extent cross-language transfer occurs subsequent to rehabilitation. Factors contributing to the paucity of research in this area relate to the multitude of possible language combinations in a bilingual individual, the relative competency of the two languages of the bilingual individual and the effect of focal brain damage on bilingual language representation. It is, however, unfeasible to examine these issues without undertaking a large scale longitudinal study in this population. As a potential solution, in our previous work, we developed a computational model to simulate language recovery following rehabilitation in bilingual aphasia. Specifically, we trained, lesioned, and retrained a bilingual computational model in order to systematically characterize the effect of AoA, pre-stroke language proficiency, and post-stroke naming output on the rehabilitation outcomes. Results demonstrated that a computational model including these variables was able to capture the many complex profiles that surface in aphasia both before and after intervention. In addition, it was able to predict the extent of cross-language generalization. However, the work of using this model to fully understand bilingual aphasia rehabilitation has just begun. In the proposed project, we extend this work to now examine the predictive abilities of the model and identify the factors that can maximize cross-language generalization. We also extend the architecture and functionality of this model, which was originally developed to simulate Spanish-English bilingual language processing, to Chinese-English which is another language combination commonly encountered in the US and has a strong theoretical and experimental foundation in computational modeling. The proposed work is innovative, because it uses a computational model to predict optimal rehabilitation protocols to facilitate the greatest amount of language recovery in bilingual aphasia. The successful completion of this project is expected to have an important impact on rehabilitation of stroke and bilingual aphasia as well as on the applications of computational modeling. This project is important because it will address the important issue of language recovery following treatment in individuals with bilingual aphasia by using a computational model to predict treatment outcomes in patients. It is predicted that the patients who are treated based on the model's predictions will outperform patients who are trained in the language opposite to the model's predictions, because each treatment plan is customized to that patient's impairment and bilingual language profile. This project will also provide a computational explanation for the hypothesis that different patterns of cross-language generalization in bilingual patients arise from facilitation and inhibition mechanisms on the computational maps.

"System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care  Over the past decade, the proportion of minority older adults residing in nursing homes (NHs) has increased dramatically and is projected to surpass that of white adults by 2030.1 NHs account for 68% of the $72 billion spent on long-term care in 2008 with most of it funded by Medicaid. These demographic and financial realities create an urgency to understand the needs of minorities in NHs and how systems organization and care delivery in NHs operate to ensure that minority residents maintain quality of life (QoL) and receive quality of care (QoC) equitable to white residents. QoL is a patient-centered measure that captures social, psychological, and environmental well-being. QoC typically consists of staff-reported indicators of care delivery and its related to clinical outcomes (e.g., pressure ulcers). Racial disparities exist in certain QoC indicators, and our recent work for the first time found racial disparities in NH resident QoL. However, those disparities were not based on individual race/ethnicity, but reflected system-wide factors affecting NHs that served more minority residents. Some of these factors are not amenable to intervention, including location of high-minority proportion NHs in poorer areas. There is a need to identify modifiable system-wide mechanisms for these disparities to craft interventions that address them.  Our long-term goal is to develop an intervention for improving QoL for minority NH residents nationwide. To build toward that goal, we designed a multi-method study to examine organizational structures and processes of care in NHs with high and low proportions of minorities, and then assess system-level predictors of NH QoL (primary outcome) and QoC (secondary outcomes) in a unique state-level database with more granular measures as well as a nationally-representative database. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1: Assess and compare, via qualitative methods, the structural, cultural, and process factors influencing QoL and QoC for minority residents among NHs with high, moderate, and low proportions of minority residents. Aim 2: Determine the effect of system-level factors on racial/ethnic differences in NH QoL(primary) and QoC (secondary outcome) using a unique statewide dataset. Aim 3: Using national data from all licensed NHs in the US, test the effect of system-level predictors on racial differences in QoL (primary) and QoC (secondary outcome). Narrative Despite the increase in use of nursing home services by racial/ethnic minority groups, we know little about the needs of minorities in these settings. This project will examine modifiable system- wide mechanisms for nursing home resident quality of care and quality of care for minority older adults. We will use a mixed-methods design with state and national data.  ",System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care,9701798,R01MD010729,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Communities ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' rurality ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,256343,0.016189992675890604
"Quality of Early Mother-Child Communication and Language Outcome in Low-Income Hispanic Children Project Abstract Academic trajectories are established early, and children who enter school without the requisite readiness skills are at greatest risk for academic failure. Although language ability in early childhood is one of the strongest predictors of school readiness, many low-income children are markedly delayed in language ability. Dubbed the 30-million word gap, Hart and Risley (1995) demonstrated that children living in poverty hear substantially fewer words than their more affluent peers, and these findings have spurred national initiatives designed to increase the quantity of language input to young low-income children to establish positive early learning trajectories. However, exciting new research suggests these well-intentioned interventions may not have their desired impact if they do not also increase the quality of the communication foundation supporting language learning during early caregiver-child interactions. Hispanic children in Spanish-speaking and low income households are at significant risk for language delays and early academic failure, but there is little research regarding how to best support their language development and academic success. Our new findings regarding the importance of the quality of the communication foundation in the earliest years highlight how nonverbal and verbal qualities of parent-child interactions support the development of language skill and pave the way for developing optimal interventions. Spanish-speaking children are an important target for such interventions. An important preliminary step towards this goal, however, is to replicate this compelling research conducted with non-Hispanic African American and European American children with Spanish-speaking children. Building upon an existing study in Dallas that includes a large number of Mexican-origin Spanish- speaking families, we are uniquely positioned to address the following three aims: Aim 1. To refine the measurement methods for assessing the quality of the communication foundation so that they encompass culturally distinct patterns of parent-child interaction among Spanish- speaking Mexican-American families. Aim 2. To examine the relation between the quality of the early communication foundation and subsequent child language development among young Spanish-speaking Mexican-American children. Aim 3. To examine the relation between the quality of the early communication foundation and academic achievement in kindergarten and first grade among young Spanish-speaking Mexican- American children and whether it is mediated by early language development. Methods will include a comprehensive review and systematic modification of the existing rating protocol to capture those aspects of the early communication foundation among low-income Spanish-speaking mothers and their children. This revised rating system will be applied to existing data for a longitudinal cohort of low- income Mexican-American children selected from the Dallas Preschool Readiness Study (DPReP). Multivariate regression methods will be used to examine relations between the communication foundation assessed at age 2½ with language and school readiness outcomes at ages 3½ and kindergarten. Project Narrative Hispanic children in Spanish-speaking and low income households are at heightened risk for language delays and early academic failure. In this study, we will use video-recorded data from an established study to refine a rating system to capture characteristics of the quality of the early communication foundation among low- income Spanish-speaking mothers and their 2½ year old children. Data captured using this refined rating system will be used to examine relations between the quality of the communication foundation and later child language development and school readiness using data already being collected as part of the parent longitudinal study.",Quality of Early Mother-Child Communication and Language Outcome in Low-Income Hispanic Children,9540902,R01HD086832,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Language ', ' Communication ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Household ', ' Intelligence ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mother-Child Relations ', ' mother child interaction ', ' Mother-Child Relationship ', ' Mothers ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' County ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Rituals ', ' Ritual compulsion ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' first grade ', ' 1st grade ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' high school ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' two years of age ', ' two year old ', ' aged two years ', ' aged 2 years ', ' age 2 years ', ' 2 years of age ', ' 2 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,313817,0.03922508838472152
"Bridges to the Doctorate in Nursing for Northeastern Ohio ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in the US have significant impact on the health of Americans. To successfully address health disparities requires increasing the number of scientists from the groups most commonly impacted by health disparities. As the largest group of health care professionals, nurses and nurse scientists have the potential to improve health disparities yet fewer than 2% of American RNs have PhDs. With the current national initiatives related to chronic diseases, the need for self-management, and ongoing health care reform to include team- based primary care, nurse scientists have the potential to make substantial and significant contributions to the science of improving health and to address health disparities. Yet there are too few nurse scientists, particularly from under-represented (UR) groups. The purpose of this project is to increase the number of nurse scientists from under-represented groups by providing a transitional program, bridging master's nursing students from Cleveland State University (CSU) and Ursuline College (UC) into the PhD program at the Frances Payne Bolton (FPB) School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University. Nursing, as a female predominant discipline, faces additional challenges in attaining PhDs beyond that faced by other scientific disciplines. Within MSN and PhD programs, there are increasing numbers of nurses from minority backgrounds, 29.3% and 27.7%, respectively. Despite this increased educational attainment, Schools of Nursing remain with too few nurse faculty from UR groups: fewer than 12% of nurse faculty come from minority backgrounds. The aims of the 5 year project are to: 1. Identify and recruit 5 cohorts of Bridges participants during their master's degree programs, one cohort (n = 4) in each year, and provide mentored research experience (years 1 through 5) 2. Provide joint mentoring by UC, CSU and FPB to Bridges participants (years 1 through 5) with a focus on identifying and addressing the gaps often experienced by students from UR groups to enhance retention and socialization into academic roles. 3. Admit Bridges student graduates from UC and CSU into PhD study at FPB/Case Western Reserve University. To accomplish these aims, have developed a plan to identify and recruit promising MSN students from UC and CSU who are in the MSN programs. We will select 2 students from CSU and 2 students from UC each year for a total of 20 students over the 5 year period. The Bridges students will then be assigned co-mentors, one from their MSN institution and one from FPB CWRU, and participate in paid mentored research experiences while they complete their MSNs. In addition, each cohort of 4 students will receive tailored programming to assist them in addressing needs and challenges that are specific to students from underrepresented groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nurse scientists can contribute to improvements in health disparities but there are too few nurse scientists from underrepresented groups. The intent of this program is to increase the number of nurse scientists by ""bridging"" students from MSN programs at Cleveland State University and Ursuline College into the PhD program in nursing at the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University.

"Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent racial disparities in neonatal mortality rates are a major public health concern. Black neonates are more than twice as likely to die as white neonates. In previous research in New York City (NYC) hospitals, we found nearly a three-fold variation in risk-adjusted very low birth weight (VLBW) neonatal mortality rates among hospitals and black infants were much more likely to be born at higher mortality hospitals. The factors that influence wide variation in mortality rates among hospitals are not known. Why black women are more likely to deliver at higher mortality hospitals is also unknown. The objectives of this study are: 1) To examine risk- adjusted neonatal mortality among New York City hospitals over the past decade and assess the extent to which variations in hospital quality contribute to VLBW mortality disparities for blacks and Latinos; 2) To use an innovative mixed methods approach to explore processes of care, unit characteristics, patient factors, and organizational factors that explain differences in hospital quality as measured by overall and cause-specific risk-adjusted mortality rates and use of evidence-based practices; 3) To explore patients' perspectives on barriers to receipt of high quality care by exploring barriers to timely care, communication, availability of high risk obstetrics care, knowledge, decision-making regarding delivery hospital, and perception of risk; and 4) To create specific strategies with key stakeholders to promote uptake of best practices at hospitals caring for VLBW infants including patient-centered strategies to minimize barriers to receipt of high quality care. Methods: In Phase 1, we will use NYC Vital Statistics records linked with New York State Discharge Abstract Data to develop a risk-adjusted VLBW neonatal mortality model. We will use this model to rank hospitals based on risk-adjusted mortality. We will then examine the distribution of black, Latino, and white births among hospitals. In Phases 2 and 3 we will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to determine which hospital factors and practice patterns may explain the wide variation in mortality outcomes among hospitals and to explore why black mothers deliver in higher mortality hospitals. We will then convene leaders of obstetrics and neonatologists, hospital quality leaders, community leaders, NYC and State Departments of Health, and patients to discuss our results and explore interventions to improve care for VLBW infants. Information from this study will provide a better understanding of quality in neonatal care in hospitals and reveal specific processes of care that can be improved upon to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant black/white disparities in neonatal mortality rates are partially explained by the fact that black mothers are more likely to deliver in higher mortaliy hospitals. Results from this study will explore why such wide variations in hospital neonatal mortality rates exist and why black moms deliver at higher mortality hospitals.

"EMTALA Enforcement: An evaluation of hospital characteristics associated with citation, and hospital response to citation Project Summary The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is one of the most important pieces of federal legislation governing emergency care. EMTALA was passed in 1986 in response to highly publicized incidents of inadequate, delayed or denied treatment of uninsured patients by emergency departments (EDs). The intent of EMTALA was to prevent EDs from practicing patient “dumping,” defined as turning away or transferring patients without authorization or initiation of appropriate stabilizing measures based on their ability to pay. EMTALA requires that all ED patients receive a timely medical screening evaluation, stabilization of identified emergent conditions, and, when indicated, transfer to another facility for higher level of care. EMTALA is an actively enforced law. EMTALA empowers the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to authorize EMTALA investigations and grants substantial punitive powers. Since 2005, 43% of U.S. hospitals have been investigated and 27% cited for EMTALA violation. There is 5-fold variation in rates of EMTALA citations across CMS regions. It is unknown whether this variation reflects arbitrary differences in reporting, investigation and enforcement of alleged violations, or true differences in quality of care. Little is known about characteristics of hospitals cited for EMTALA violations or how facility response to citation impacts access to care for patients served by the institution. To evaluate whether EMTALA enforcement serves as a viable tool to reduce health disparities and promote quality we propose to (1) create a longitudinal dataset of EMTALA citations 2005-2016 linked to hospital characteristics and quality of care measures, (2) use multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the associations between facility-level features (e.g., payer mix, hospital quality, ED volume, urban/rural status) and citation for an EMTALA violation, and (3) survey hospital administrators to explore facility response to EMTALA citations. We will conduct an exploratory survey of administrators at California hospitals with recent EMTALA citations (2014-2016, n=96) to characterize and describe operational changes following citations. We expect facilities to respond to EMTALA citations with a variety of measures including modification of on-call specialist coverage, overhauling policies and procedures, educating providers, auditing procedural compliance, and instituting other important but resource intensive measures including hiring additional ED providers, opening beds, or upgrading facilities. Understanding whether EMTALA citations disproportionately impact facilities with poor quality, or hospitals serving vulnerable populations, and how facilities respond to EMTALA citation will improve understanding of how EMTALA impacts access to emergency care for vulnerable populations. EDs are an essential part of the U.S. safety-net, and the provider of last resort for millions of underserved low-income and minority patients, making this issue of particular importance to the AHRQ priority populations. Project Narrative The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is the most important federal legislation governing emergency care, as EMTALA citations can result in CMS provider agreement termination and lead to hospital closure. Currently there are no published studies examining predictors of EMTALA citation or how facilities respond to citation. Understanding whether EMTALA enforcement disproportionately impacts facilities with poor quality, or hospitals serving vulnerable populations, and how facilities respond to EMTALA citations will help to elucidate whether EMTALA enforcement serves as a viable tool to reduce health disparities and promote quality.","EMTALA Enforcement: An evaluation of hospital characteristics associated with citation, and hospital response to citation",9530337,R03HS025281,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R03,2018,100000,0.027987040644921118
"Impact of Volume-Based Regionalization on Access to Care in Patients Undergoing Pancreatectomy Project Summary/Abstract  Hospital volume has been shown to be inversely correlated with surgical mortality rates in complex surgery. Since the popularization of its concept, there has been a push towards volume-based regionalization of pancreatectomy. This past year, three major health systems have imposed minimum- volume standards that will bar hospitals and surgeons not meeting the threshold from performing complex surgery, and are pushing for other health systems to pledge to the low-volume threshold mandate.  However, the impact of such a regionalization strategy on patient preferences and access to care remains unclear. Pancreatectomy has demonstrated the most pronounced association between volume and mortality rates, and represents the procedure that stands to gain the most from such a policy. However, national data demonstrates that up to 70% of patients with early stage pancreatic cancer do not receive surgical intervention, of which racial minorities, patients on Medicaid and the uninsured make up the majority of this cohort. This was hypothesized to be secondary to nihilism towards the disease and the complexity of the operation needed for hopes of long-term survival. As such, a proposed low-volume threshold mandate may cause unintended consequences by exerting more constraints on patients to receive care.  Preliminary data has demonstrated that the vulnerable cohort as described above tend to travel shorter distances for pancreatectomy, and often undergo the surgery at hospitals with poorer quality. The objective of this study is to assess the potential impact of the proposed low-volume threshold mandate on access to care in patients undergoing pancreatectomy. Specifically, we will quantitatively assess the impact on distance needed to travel by patients and overall mortality rates in a setting where all patients are redirected to high-volume centers, and a simulated setting where patients with lower likelihood of travelling do not receive care. Additionally, we will perform qualitative assessment of the facilitators and constraints that patients face to receive care.  When completed, this study will provide novel data highlighting the impact of volume-based regionalization on access to care. Additionally, it will bring attention to reduce current disparities in health care quality and access with respect to vulnerable populations, and inform interventions to alleviate the issue, a core goal of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Lastly, our study will provide stimulus for research in more appropriate measures of quality than volume, as volume may be over-simplifying a complex issue and a dangerous metric to be incentivizing hospitals on. Project Narrative While volume-based regionalization of a complex procedure like pancreatectomy may improve outcomes of patients receiving the procedure, it may have a detrimental impact on access to care. This study will attempt to quantify the impact of a proposed low- volume threshold mandate on access to care, and qualitatively assess facilitators and constraints patients face to access care to inform interventions and policy decisions that can alleviate this public health burden.",Impact of Volume-Based Regionalization on Access to Care in Patients Undergoing Pancreatectomy,9653367,F32CA217455,"['Attention ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Interview ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pancreatectomy ', ' Pancreas Excision ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Travel ', ' Measures ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Stimulus ', ' Policies ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Complex ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' primary care setting ', ' operation ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,F32,2018,80158,0.005809951197458249
"Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: A model to improve primary care for Hispanics with diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrated Second Language Learning for Chronic Care: An Intervention to Improve Nursing Care for Hispanics with Diabetes ABSTRACT Language barriers in healthcare are recognized as a leading determinant of health disparities among Hispanics in the United States.1 Limited English proficiency (LEP) has also been linked to the soaring diabetes epidemic among Hispanics. For Hispanics, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is 1.5 times that of non- Hispanic whites.3 Hispanic patients who do not speak English at home are at greater risk of foregoing diabetes care and they are significantly less likely than non-Hispanics to adopt a special diet for diabetes control, to exercise regularly, and to receive a yearly eye examination.6, 3 Recent research suggests that language concordance (LC) between patients and primary care providers is an effective precondition that improves outcomes in the treatment of LEP patients with diabetes. Interventions to increase the number of LC nurse practitioners consist of educational programs that develop second language (L2) abilities for health care professionals. A review of extant literature on L2 training for health professionals revealed that the preponderance of programs and materials are directed at basic levels of proficiency and confined to limited types of clinical interactions. The view of he present research team is that these programs and materials are substantially geared towards acute care and reflect a mismatch between an LEP patient population with chronic illnesses and a health professional workforce trained in L2 for acute care functions. This mismatch, we contend, exacerbates the difficulties faced by LEP patients with diabetes in achieving successful self- management and the physical and emotional wellness that goes along with it. This proposal describes the design and evaluation of an innovative educational intervention for nurse practitioner students called Integrated Language Learning for Chronic Care (IL2L). It pursues an integrated development of L2 and communication skills that will facilitate productive interactions between Spanish-speaking nurse practitioners and LEP Hispanic patients with diabetes. A mixed-method study design will be used to examine the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of the intervention. At the patient level, we will employ an RCT to determine the impact IL2L on the physical health, mental health, and self-efficacy of patients with uncontrolled diabetes. At the student level, we will employ the Roter Interaction Analysis System to measure gains in Spanish language interaction skills pre and post intervention. At the program level, we will use language program evaluation methodologies to assess the acceptability of the intervention within a nurse practitioner training program in a leading College of Nursing.

"Impacts of payment reform on racial disparities in hospital psychiatric care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In July 2014, Maryland implemented a statewide hospital payment reform that includes global capitated budgeting to increase efficiency and performance incentives to improve quality. By encouraging hospitals to address the unmet needs of minority patients, this sweeping change has the potential to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in care coordination for individuals who are hospitalized as a result of a mental healt condition. However, such payment reforms, if not carefully designed, could incentivize ""safety-net"" hospitals, which provide access to psychiatric care in low-income minority urban communities, to offer fewer psychiatric services in order to reduce costs. In this study, hospitals administrative data are used in a non-experimental difference-in-difference-in-differences regression framework to examine the effects of the Maryland payment reform on racial-ethnic disparities in hospital-based psychiatric care at safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals. The study's primary outcomes are receipt of outpatient follow-up and transitional care management services after a psychiatric inpatient stay, hospital readmission, and hospital spending per patient for psychiatric services. These impacts are identified by comparing changes in Maryland (the intervention state) with changes in Pennsylvania (the comparison state) after, versus before, July 2014. This proposed study is significant and timely because it can inform policymakers' assessments of how similar ""value- based"" hospital payment reforms in other states can be designed to improve care for minority patients while preserving the psychiatric care safety-net in low-income minority communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although ""value-based"" health care payment reforms might reduce racial-ethnic disparities in health care coordination for individuals receiving psychiatric inpatient care, such payment reforms, if not carefully designed, could instead result in reduced access to psychiatric care services in predominantly low-income minority communities. This study can inform policymakers' assessments of how to design value-based payment reforms in order to reduce disparities in psychiatric care while preserving the psychiatric care safety-net in low-income minority communities.",Impacts of payment reform on racial disparities in hospital psychiatric care,9440287,R01MD010255,"['Affect ', ' Budgets ', ' Communities ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Psychiatric Hospitals ', ' mental health facility ', ' Mental Institutions ', ' Mental Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Maryland ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Acute ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Services ', ' hospital utilization ', ' Performance ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' payment ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Hospital safety ', ' cost ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' service utilization ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' minority communities ', ' care costs ', ' readmission risk ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2018,482001,0.029878515398999807
"Rural-Urban Disparity in Post-Acute Care ABSTRACT  While age-adjusted mortality rates in rural and urban counties in the United States were similar during the 1970s and 1980s, over the last two decades mortality rates declined at a much faster rate in urban counties, resulting in a widening rural-urban survival gap. The factors contributing to this growing disparity remain largely unidentified, despite the fact that more than 23% of the fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare population resides in non-metropolitan, rural counties. This application explores how much of this gap can be explained by differences in how post-acute care (PAC) is delivered. Very little is known about discrepancies in the types of PAC resources available to Medicare beneficiaries living in urban and rural areas, such as the type of PAC setting in which they receive their care, the quality of that PAC provider, or drivers of variations in care. The absence of this information complicates efficient and informed hospital discharge planning for rural Medicare beneficiaries and policy efforts to ameliorate this growing disparity in health outcomes. The objective of this application is to assemble and analyze national data to assess rural-urban disparities in the availability, selection, utilization, and outcomes of PAC. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that rural PAC markets have fewer and lower quality PAC choices, and that these restricted options result in worse health outcomes, contributing to the widening rural-urban health gap. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work revealing that: 1) there is no rural-urban discrepancy in hospital mortality rates; 2) there is no rural-urban discrepancy in the predicted likelihood of mortality following live hospital discharge; 3) yet, a substantially lower proportion of rural beneficiaries are discharged with PAC, and 4) consistent with other studies, post-hospital-discharge mortality is higher in rural areas. To achieve this objective, we propose three aims. First, we will compare trends in the availability of different types of PAC in rural and urban markets and determine the relationship of these trends in PAC availability to age-adjusted mortality. Second, we will compare the selection of PAC settings between beneficiaries hospitalized in urban versus rural hospitals. Third, we will compare PAC outcomes, including mortality, hospital readmission, emergency department visits, and length of PAC use between beneficiaries discharged from urban versus rural hospitals. We propose to study fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with an acute hospitalization in 2012-14 for one of five tracer conditions: hip fracture, lower extremity joint replacement, congestive heart failure, COPD, and stroke, integrating Medicare enrollment, claims, and PAC resident assessment data. This study lays important groundwork for future studies on developing efficient ways to deliver home-based care for beneficiaries living in remote areas, improving care coordination between rural hospitals and PAC providers, and designing appropriate payment schemes for care providers and risk-bearing health insurers to deliver optimal care in rural markets. NARRATIVE  The proposed study examines rural-urban disparities in the availability, selection, utilization, and outcomes of post-acute care (PAC). Lower access to and quality of PAC may play a key role in the rapidly widening rural-urban gap in health outcomes. Our results will help hospitals and patients to make informed decisions about PAC selection and improve coordination between acute and post-acute care.",Rural-Urban Disparity in Post-Acute Care,9407001,R21AG053712,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' United States ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' joint replacement ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' rural planning ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' payment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Scheme ', ' trend ', ' Tracer ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' critical access hospital ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' evidence base ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural counties ', ' rural setting ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' hospital services ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,232620,0.016885772253780816
"The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes The National Institutes of Health and the American College of Surgeons recently suggested that one potential explanation for racial disparities in surgical outcomes is that minority and white patients may receive care in hospitals that provide differing quality of care. Few studies have been able to identify the factors underlying the between-hospital quality differences that are actionable targets for intervention through system redesign. Our work focuses on a systems feature given little attention in surgical disparities studies—differences in the nursing resources across hospitals, including registered nurse staffing and skill mix, the percentage of nurses with at least a bachelors in nursing (BSN) degree, and nurse work environments. Despite the large body of evidence linking these nursing features to surgical outcomes, it is not clear whether: 1) differences across hospitals in nursing resources are contributing to observed surgical disparities; 2) whether minority patients, because of differences in relative risk, are more sensitive to limited nursing resources; and 3) whether there are particular combinations of nursing resources that are most effective in reducing disparities. Our study will answer these questions. This application builds upon the successful scientific programs of two research teams: one with unique data and capabilities for evaluating the impact of nursing on surgical outcomes and disparities, and another which has pioneered Tapered Multivariate Matching methods to carefully control for differences in clinical risk between minority and white surgical patients in order to clearly identify the basis of outcomes disparities. We merge these two highly successful programs and combine novel Tapered Multivariate Matching approaches with unique new data on hospital nursing and surgical patient outcomes in over 700 hospitals in four large states to explicitly identify the conditions, in terms of nursing resources, that best serve to reduce surgical disparities. Our first aim is to determine whether and to what extent disparities in surgical outcomes (mortality, failure to rescue, readmissions, length of stay, intensive care use) between minority and white patients undergoing the exact same procedure result from: a) differences between minority and white patients themselves; and b) differences in nursing resources (including nurse education, staffing, skill mix, and the nurse work environment) and other characteristics (e.g., volume) of the often very different hospitals where minority and white patients predominantly receive care. Our second aim will allow us to identify if subpopulations of minority patients (e.g., high vs. low risk; specific procedure/comorbidity combinations) benefit more from specific nursing resource configurations. Our final aim will capitalize on panel data, spanning nearly a decade for over 700 hospitals and the patients in them, to determine whether changes in nursing are associated with changes in disparities—strengthening a case that associations we find in cross-sectional studies may be causal. Better evidence about the relationship between nursing and racial disparities in surgical outcomes can spur evidence-based interventions targeting modifiable aspects of nursing to reduce disparities. Project Narrative Our study focuses on a systems feature given little attention in research on racial disparities in surgical patient outcomes—differences in the nursing resources across hospitals. By using new multivariate matching methods to study patients in a large panel of hundreds of hospitals over nearly a decade, we will separately determine the effects of patient, surgeon, nursing, and hospital characteristics on racial disparities, closely examine the relationship between nursing and disparities in specific procedure and patient groups, and learn whether changes in nursing resources over time have had consequences for racial disparities in surgery outcomes. Our research can translate into interventions tailored to reduce surgical disparities by addressing the mismatch for some minority patients in terms of the specific nursing resources needed to yield the best outcomes.",The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes,9540945,R01MD011679,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Attention ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospitals ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Caring ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' Relative Risks ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"PROMIS-Deaf Profile: Inclusion of Deaf Patients in Disability and Outcomes Research Current patient-reported outcome measures are heavily dependent on English, which present serious language barriers to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) patients who use American Sign Language (ASL). The availability of patient-reported outcome measures in ASL and English and such that is valid for users of accessible technology and services will provide important insights on improving prevention and treatment models that will lead to better personal and public health within the underserved DHH population.  The research plan builds on Dr. Kushalnagar's prior research on communication and quality of life outcomes with deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) population. Communication-related fatigue is relevant to healthcare outcomes. Specific aims include (1) describing the linguistic and internal validity of PROMIS-Deaf profile, (2) examining QoL domains across DHH sub-groups, and (3) evaluating the prevalence of communicative stress and risk factors for health status and generic QoL in a nationwide sample of early-deafened adults.  The study will be conducted by a research team that includes: an early career investigator with expertise in quality of life outcomes in DHH population, a senior investigator with expertise in patient reported outcome measures (the creator of the FACIT fatigue QoL measure), a psychometrician with experience in conducting IRT and psychometric analyses for patient reported outcome measures, an audiologist with expertise in (re)habilitative audiology and hearing related outcomes, an ASL translation expert, and a biostatistician. The Advisory Committee consists of experts on the subject matter related to the project and who are nationally known for their work with DHH population.  Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that may contribute to poor quality of life frequently observed for individuals with hearing loss. The goals of this application are consistent with the NIDCD 2012-2016 strategies related to improving outcomes for human communication and reducing health disparities, and expected findings will support the development of a future grant proposal for a randomized study that will assess the ability of PROMIS- Deaf profile to detect minimally important changes with intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PROMIS-Deaf profile is a patient reported outcome measure that is accessible in American Sign Language and English. Such measure that has been validated in these languages will allow future research and clinical trials to include deaf and hard of hearing population without barrier.

"Disparities in the Outcomes and Processes of Care for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The Role of Differences in the Organization and Delivery of Nursing Project Summary In-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) represent catastrophic, often terminal events and affect up to 700,000 patients annually. Despite the resources and opportunity to intervene early when cardiac arrests occur, fewer than a quarter of patients survive to discharge, and survival varies significantly across institutions and by race. Black patients, in particular, experience up to 12% lower odds of survival and more pronounced neurologic and functional impairment following a cardiac arrest. Disparities in cardiac arrest outcomes are largely attributed to quality gaps at the institutions where minorities receive care. Variations in the process of care delivery in these settings suggests that hospitals where Blacks receive care may be fundamentally different in their ability to detect and prevent death and significant debilitation. Our study will examine institutional mechanisms underlying IHCA disparities through a focused examination of front line care providers. In the hospital, nurses are the primary clinical surveillance system and play an integral role in the initiation and delivery of emergency responses. Nurses are at the bedside 24 hours a day; they are responsible for early warning system monitoring; they have direct knowledge of patient conditions and changes in conditions and are often the first on the scene of a cardiac arrest. The ability for nurses to respond appropriately to acute changes in patient status has been linked to nursing organizational factors, including nurse staffing, nurse education, nursing skill mix, and the nurse work environment. The relationship between the organization of nursing and minority IHCA outcomes, however, is unknown. We posit that nurses play a significant, yet underexplored, role in IHCA patient outcomes, and that variation in nursing across hospitals may help explain IHCA outcome disparities. To examine this relationship, we take advantage of multiple large and unique databases: The American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines–Resuscitation (GWTG-R) clinical registry and the NINR-funded RN4CAST-US studies (R01-NR004513 and R01-NR014855). The clinical registry incorporates uniformly reported and precisely defined clinical variables developed by international experts. Using unique hospital identifiers to link patient outcomes with measures of nursing care from RN4CAST-US, we will identify specific, actionable elements of nursing that influence minority IHCA patient outcomes. The data set that we will assemble includes nurse survey data collected in 2006 and 2015. Using independent cross-sections of tens of thousands of patients in the same large sample of hospitals, enables us to examine trends and relationships between nursing and minority IHCA outcomes and determine if they vary over time. Knowing whether these associations are stable and enduring, in spite of changes in both patient case-mix and acuity and in the nursing characteristics that may be greater in some hospitals than others, will provide stronger evidence that the associations are persistent and that our results are generalizable. Project Narrative Racial disparities in In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (IHCA) outcomes are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By examining the inter-related effects of nursing care organization and delivery, our study will help explain previously unexplored causes of IHCA disparities and inform efforts to improve clinical care in the hospitals that could most benefit from them.",Disparities in the Outcomes and Processes of Care for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The Role of Differences in the Organization and Delivery of Nursing,9572948,R01MD011518,"['Link ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' nursing skill ', ' Provider ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' data registry ', ' Emergency response ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' individual patient ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Electric Countershock ', ' defibrillation ', ' Electric Defibrillation ', ' Cardioversion ', ' Cardiac Electroversion ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Process ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Survivors ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,366912,0.1220984786717387
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",9528240,U01TR002393,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Sources ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' functional status ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' simulation ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Data ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Permission ', ' Authorization ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' Text ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' social health determinants ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' Patient risk ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' data access ', ' incentive-based program ', ' incentive program ', ' readmission rates ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2018,802080,0.02528670287708964
"A Geographic Approach to Determining the Preventable Causes of US Sepsis Mortality Abstract This AHRQ K08 project employs big data strategies and geographic information system (GIS) informatics and analytics to fill critical knowledge gaps in determining the individual and hospital quality factors that influence sepsis mortality in the US. The training leverages Dr. Jordan Kempker’s Masters of Science and Clinical Research and KL2 training in Social Epidemiology and R programming for data science. Further training will develop practical expertise in GIS informatics for merging disparate data for new risk factor discoveries and GIS analytics to define and account for disease clustering in the determination of individual and systems-based risk factors for US sepsis deaths. To accomplish this goal Dr. Kempker will take coursework a sequence of semester- long courses at the Emory Rollins School of Public Health in the application of GIS in public health and an Emory Faculty Development Course in Health Services Research application. The proposal includes the continued expert, interdisciplinary mentorship of content-expert Greg S. Martin, MD, MSc from Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine; GIS-expert Lance A. Waller, PhD from the Department of Biostatistics; and Social Epidemiologist Michael R. Kramer, MPH, PhD from Department of Epidemiology. The mentored research has 2 Specific Aims: 1) to characterize the geographic correlations among sepsis deaths and the identified individual risk factors for sepsis mortality; and 2) to determine the association between hospital quality in sepsis treatment and sepsis case-fatality at both the hospital- and individual-level. This body of knowledge will build a multilevel understanding of the risk factors for sepsis mortality in the US and infuse GIS techniques into sepsis health services research, identifying new opportunities to create large longitudinal cohorts, connect disparate data sources for new discoveries, account for spatial relationships to improve statistical estimates and create heat maps that direct allocation of public resources to areas of most need. This trajectory of innovative work will inform agendas of public agencies such as the National Healthcare Safety Network, the Joint Commission, National Quality Forum and CMS as well as private sector healthcare systems. It is directly relevant to the impacts of quality measures on hospital outcomes. Finally, this project will build the foundation for at least one future R01 examining further how these factors mediate socioeconomic disparities in sepsis. Project Narrative Sepsis is a major public health problem in the United States and this project aims to use existing national-level big data to identify both: 1) the individual health conditions, behaviors and socioeconomic factors; and 2) the hospital quality factors that contribute to preventable sepsis deaths. Furthermore, this project will utilize geographically coded data to identify the sepsis hotspots in the United States that may benefit from specifically targeted interventions.",A Geographic Approach to Determining the Preventable Causes of US Sepsis Mortality,9527472,K08HS025240,[''],AHRQ,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K08,2018,150476,0.019656575526408145
"Patient Safety in Nursing Homes: A Closer Look at Improvement Recent improvements in measures of patient safety in nursing homes look, at first glance, like a monumental policy success. The reported percent of nursing home residents suffering pressure sores, falls, and urinary tract infections decreased dramatically since the early 2000s, when policymakers began numerous initiatives focused on improving nursing home quality. However, skepticism has emerged as to whether the improved performance on patient safety measures truly reflects improvements in residents’ outcomes or, alternatively, simply reflects changes in documentation since the data for the patient safety measures are self-reported by nursing homes. Policymakers interested in improving outcomes and maximizing the usefulness of the patient safety measures share this skepticism, especially in cases where performance on patient safety measures is not matched by performance on other established measures of quality. Several recent New York Times articles drew national attention to the issue, highlighting several cases where consumers felt misled by high quality ratings into choosing nursing homes that fell far short of expectations. Whether reported improvements in patient safety reflect true improvements in nursing home resident outcomes has particular import for disparities in the quality of nursing home care. It is well known that nursing homes with a high proportion of Medicaid residents, often located in poor neighborhoods and disproportionately serving members of racial and ethnic minority groups, provide lower quality of care on average. Although high- Medicaid nursing homes had notable improvements in many patient safety measures over the past two decades, if this performance does not reflect resident well-being and outcomes, these scores may mask the need for real quality improvement and do little to address disparities in nursing home care. Our overall objective in this mixed-methods study is to assess whether and how nursing homes are improving patient safety, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence as to how high-performing and high- improving nursing homes achieve these scores. By correlating this performance with other well-established measures of quality and potential mechanisms for improvement, we will gain insight as to whether these improvements are meaningful and whether they are equitably distributed. To address the first three Aims, we propose econometric analysis of multiple merged data sets for 2011-2014. The fourth Aim will entail primary qualitative data collection through interviews and observation of nursing homes. Our results will directly inform 1) how consumers should interpret nursing home performance on patient safety measures; 2) how policymakers might refine the measures and identify nursing homes in which performance on the measures may be less reliable; and 3) best practices for meaningful improvement. Narrative: Our overall goal in this study is to improve patient safety in nursing homes by taking a closer look at what it means for nursing homes to improve on reported patient safety measures. Our analyses will aid in interpretation and refinement of measures and identify best practices. Nursing home residents are a particularly vulnerable population responsible for disproportionate health care spending and utilization; thus the health outcomes of this population are of key policy concern.",Patient Safety in Nursing Homes: A Closer Look at Improvement,9527062,R01HS024967,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,459804,0.05851500048723229
"Mi Puente: My Bridge to Better Cardiometabolic Health and Well-being ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals of low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics, the largest U.S. ethnic minority group, are disproportionately burdened by chronic cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (""cardiometabolic"" e.g., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). High levels of unmet behavioral health needs (e.g., related to mental health, life stressors, healthcare access) in this population contribute to the striking disparities in disease prevalence and outcomes. Differences in the quantity and quality of health care targeted to and received by members of the Hispanic population contribute to these disparities. Inequities in health care access and use result from the interaction of several factors, such as those related to low SES, and cultural, language, and/or communication-style differences. Our established academic-healthcare-community partnership has unique experience in developing and testing innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable chronic care interventions to reduce disparities and improve health in underserved communities. The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of Mi Puente (""My Bridge"") compared to Usual Care (UC; evidence-based, best practice discharge procedures) in 560 Hispanics adults, hospitalized with 2 or more cardiometabolic conditions and behavioral health concern(s) at a large safety net hospital near the US/Mexico border in San Diego, CA. Mi Puente is an interdisciplinary program that applies a sustainable nurse + volunteer team approach, and builds upon a strong collaborative partnership between inpatient/""referring"" and outpatient/""receiving"" care settings to improve continuity of care and address the integrated (i.e., physical and behavioral) health needs of at-risk Hispanics. Informed by the Social Ecological Model, Resources and Support for Self-Management Model, and Transtheoretical Model of behavior change, Mi Puente includes in-hospital coaching visit(s) from a Behavioral Health Nurse, and post-discharge supportive telephone calls from the nurse (week 1) and a specially-trained Volunteer Peer Mentor (weeks 1-4) that will assist patients in navigating the multi-level barriers that contribute to inequities in health care access and use, and in turn, perpetuate disparities in cardiometabolic and behavioral health. Electronic medical records (EMR) will be used to identify eligible patients and evaluate re-hospitalizations, our primary outcome, at 30- and 180-days. Changes in patient-reported physical symptoms, quality of life, healthcare utilization, patient activation, and support resources for chronic disease management will be evaluated across six months. Thorough process and cost- effectiveness analyses will evaluate the scalability and sustainability potential of Mi Puente. By capitalizing o existing hospital-based resources, and by addressing critical components of mind and body via an interdisciplinary, culturally-tailored, and sustainable intervention, Mi Puente aims to reduce health disparities in the growing and aging US Hispanic population, and holds promise for impactful expansion to other conditions and underserved populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will evaluate Mi Puente, an interdisciplinary program that applies a sustainable nurse + volunteer team approach to reduce hospitalizations, and improve functioning and quality of life, in Hispanics - an at-risk, understudied population tha experiences disparities in cardio metabolic disease prevalence and outcomes, and in behavioral health care access and use. These striking disparities in the growing and aging US Hispanic population have taxed the US healthcare system, while significantly reducing quantity and quality of life for millions of individuals. By offering a low-cost, scalable, and sustainable approach that capitalizes on existing hospital-based resources to improve the health and quality of life of Hispanics (and eventually, other at-risk, underserved groups), Mi Puente has strong potential to significantly impact public health.",Mi Puente: My Bridge to Better Cardiometabolic Health and Well-being,9530692,R01NR015754,"['Effectiveness ',

"Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes. The organization and practice of nursing have substantial positive effects on patient care and patient  outcomes. As a result of our NINR-sponsored research program continually funded since 1997, organization-based nursing interventions are now more often considered as potential solutions to poor quality and unsafe care. Organizational factors include nurse education, via preferential hiring practices  and educational benefits to employees~ nurse staffing, an evolving ""industry standard"" that has been the  focus of legislation~ human resource policies which determine nursing skill mix~ and the nursing work  environment-the organizational practices fostering the autonomy and authority required for nurses to  translate their education and experience into effective nursing care. In large, multi-state surveys of US nurses conducted in 1999 and in 2006, we have applied innovative sampling, aggregation, and measurement methods to provide rich information on nursing never before available for large numbers of  healthcare organizations that is linked to patient outcomes to document the empirical relationship between  nursing and outcomes. These data have been used to answer a range of compelling practice and policy questions about the contributions of nurses to safe, effective care. This application is an efficient, innovative extension of our line of research creating a large study of the impact of change in nursing factors on outcomes, seeking to determine more about causality in order to spur implementation of recommendations emerging from research. We will replicate in 2014 measurements made in 2006 (and 1999 in Pennsylvania) across approximately 665 hospitals and hundreds of nursing homes and home care agencies in four large states with measurement before and after the national economic downturn and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The great strength of the application is that in creating a panel of organizational observations, we can see where change has occurred and why. Specific aims are to: 1)  Collect data from random samples of nurses in CA, FL, NJ, and PA~ 2) Examine organizational-level  changes over time in nurse inputs in (a) education, (b) staffing, (c) skill mix, and (d) work environment  between 1999, 2006, and 2014~ 3) Estimate the effects of organizational-level changes on outcomes for  patients including minorities and those with chronic illnesses and determine whether lesser improvement in  nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has widened the disparity in outcomes between white and  minority patients~ and 4) Determine the effects of nursing factors in nursing home and home health agency  patient outcomes while accounting for variation in patient clinical severity and complexity.  The overarching aim of the proposed study is to determine points of comparatively low-cost organizational leverage of nursing inputs to improve patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In studying health care organizations over time, we learn what kinds of changes in nursing resources have occurred and thus are possible, and the consequences of changes for quality of care and patient outcomes.  Understanding more about the causal links between investments in nursing and patient outcomes will inform healthcare organizations about how to target their nursing investments to maximize safe, effective care for patients.",Panel Study of Effects of Changes in Nursing on Patient Outcomes,9519047,R01NR014855,"['Accounting ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Environment ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Home Health Agency ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Methods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Privatization ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Home Care Agencies ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' nursing intervention ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' nursing skill ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' human capital ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' policy implication ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' Industry Standard ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,489293,0.12553701233103734
"A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes More than 10 years since the Institute of Medicine's landmark Unequal Treatment report, racial and ethnic disparities in costly and often preventable poor outcomes persist for hospitalized older adults. Evidence points to differences in the hospitals where minorities and whites receive care as a source of disparities. Our original study findings suggest that nursing resource differences (nurse staffing, nurses' educational and skill levels, and nurse work environments) between hospitals may be an important factor underlying racial disparities. Our work thus far however has been restricted to cross-sectional data, preventing us from concluding whether the relationship between nursing resources and disparities is a causal one and whether interventions to improve nursing resources will work as intended. The study we propose in this renewal application takes the important next step to advance policy interventions by using new and unique panel data on hospital nursing and older adult patient outcomes in four large states to evaluate whether differences in outcomes between minority and white patients result from differences between minority and white patients, differences in nursing resources in the hospitals that minority and white patients receive care in, and/or differences in the care minority and white patients receive, even when they are treated in the same hospitals with similar nursing resources. We make efficient use of existing data from repeated cross-sections of hundreds of thousands of patients nested in a panel of over six hundred hospitals at two points in time. This provides a unique opportunity to examine well- known but poorly understood disparities from two distinct but complementary vantage points. First, by examining cross-sections spanning nearly a decade, we gain a better understanding of the role of individual and organizational factors in disparities in older adult hospital outcomes. Importantly, we will learn whether associations between nursing and outcomes disparities in 2015 are similar to those in the same hospital sample in 2006 and whether they differ for whites and minorities. Evidence supporting the stability of associations over time increases our warrant for concluding that connections are causal. Our second aim is to examine hospital-level changes in nursing resources over time, determine whether those changes differed for hospitals predominantly serving minority patients, and determine whether changes in outcomes disparities between minority and white patients result from changes in hospital nursing resources over time. It is important for causation and policy implications to know whether nursing resources improved less in minority serving hospitals. The panel data we will analyze will allow us to assess this, and to determine whether hospital outcomes disparities have grown (or narrowed) and whether nursing resource changes are linked with these changes. Furthermore, we will determine if the changes in nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has contributed to widening or reducing outcomes disparities between white and minority patients. Better causal evidence between nursing resources and patient outcomes can spur evidence-based decision-making. Project Narrative There is evidence that racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes for older adults are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By studying a large panel of hundreds of hospitals over nearly a decade, we will learn whether changes in hospital nursing resources have had consequences for disparities in quality of care and outcomes for hospitalized older adults. Understanding more about the causal links between investments in nursing and disparities in outcomes will inform how to target hospital investments in nursing to maximize safe, effective care for all patients.",A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes,9562950,R01AG041099,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Decision Making ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Paper ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' protective effect ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' policy implication ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' readmission risk ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,330050,0.08448846356595224
"Unintended Consequences:  Medicare Performance Programs and Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the healthcare landscape has undergone transformational changes, through public reporting of hospital performance, promotion of medical homes, and development of global payment mechanisms, all directed at improved quality and value of care. To accelerate and solidify this process, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 mandated two programs of performance-based financial incentives covering a majority of hospitals nationwide: the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) and the Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program. Beginning in 2012, the programs incentivized an increase (""reward"") or decrease (""penalty"") in Medicare reimbursement rates based on hospital performance on a range of measures - readmissions, process of care, patient experience of care, mortality - some covering all patients and others covering patients with acute admissions for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia.  Although intended to encourage evaluation and improvement of quality-of-care processes, these programs have raised considerable concern for potential adverse impact in hospitals that care for disproportionately large share of racial and ethnic minorities (""minority-serving hospitals"") or uninsured and underinsured patients (""safety-net hospitals""). First, evidence indicates that patient outcomes, such as readmissions, are affected by factors beyond the influence of hospital processes, including access to outpatient care, and family and social supports; consequently, HRRP and VBP, using hospital benchmarks that make no allowance for differences in patient socio-demographic or clinical severity profiles, may lead to higher risk of penalties for minority-serving and safety-net hospitals. Second, as minority-serving and safety-net hospitals provide more uncompensated care, leading to greater reliance on public subsidies, their investments for quality-of-care improvements are likely to be smaller; to compound this challenge, financial penalties from the Medicare programs may have a greater adverse impact for patient care and outcomes in the resource-poor hospitals due to their low operating margins.  To evaluate these concerns, the proposed study aims to examine data from the implementation experience of these programs. Using Medicare patient-level and hospital-level data (2008-2015), and a difference-in-differences study design based on comparison of hospitals exposed to the programs with those not exposed, we aim to estimate program effects on (a) hospital performance, and (b) patient outcomes - 30- day mortality and readmission - by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. In addition, we will explore alternative modifications in performance programs to incentivize safety-net and minority-serving hospitals to improve quality of care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 2012, as mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare began implementation of two programs - the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program and the Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program - that reward/penalize hospitals based on performance on process of care, patient experience, and outcomes. This has raised concern for hospitals that serve a larger share of racial/ethnic minority and low income patients, due to the higher associated risk of poor patient outcomes and lower compensation for patient care. Using data on rewards and penalties following the implementation of the two programs, this study aims to measure the program impact (a) on the quality of care in minority-serving and safety-net hospitals, and (b) on patient outcomes by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.",Unintended Consequences:  Medicare Performance Programs and Health Disparities,9386669,R01MD010527,"['Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Assertiveness ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Uncompensated Care ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient safety ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' family support ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' incentive-based program ', ' incentive program ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,273155,0.058959852674679215
"Comparative effectiveness of home care environments for diverse elders' outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a community/public health nurse and gerontological health services researcher committed to comparative effectiveness research on home health delivery systems. Her short-term training objectives are (1) to develop comparative effectiveness research methods expertise and (2) data management  and analytic methods specific to home health care datasets and research design issues. Long term research goals are to improve the design and deliver of home health nursing care outcomes for a rapidly aging and increasingly diverse population. In addition to focused research, career development plans include interaction with colleagues on her mentoring/research team, formal course work will be taken in comparative effectiveness research methods. The University of Pennsylvania will provide an outstanding environment for her career development. Resources include access to eminent interdisciplinary faculty who collaborate through focused   Research Centers in Health Services Research, Aging and Comparative Effectiveness Research, across the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Sociology, Statistics, and Business. Guided by excellent mentors, in a superb  training environment, with access to rich datasets and strong preliminary data, this proposal addresses three  specific aims: 1) Compare the effectiveness of nursing delivery system strategies (more nurses educated at  the baccalaureate level, ""front-loading"" of nursing visits, and supportive agency work environments) to improve  home health patient outcomes~ 2) Determine if and under what conditions the impact of nursing on home  health outcomes is contingent upon informal caregiver assistance~ and 3) Determine the extent of racial/ethnic  disparities in home health outcomes, and determine which nursing system delivery strategies are most likely to  be associated with improved outcomes for racial/ethnic minority patients and clinically complex older adults.  The proposed training and research will utilize the latest advances in comparative effectiveness  research methods to detect racial/ethnic disparities in home health outcomes, understand the contributing  factors (individual, family, community and health systems), and evaluate the comparative effectiveness of   nursing delivery system strategies on improving outcomes for home health patients under different individual  and socio-environmental circumstances. This innovative project will capitalize on a unique data set, comprised of nurse surveys providing detailed information about nursing care and work environment within home health agencies in nearly 250 home health agencies that serve older adults living in diverse communities. The nurse survey results combined with independent home health care patient assessment and outcomes data provides a window into each patient's unique circumstances, including the complexity and severity of their health status and care needs, as well as information about their living environment and informal caregivers. Linkages with additional administrative and public datasets will provide additional key variables regarding home health agency service patterns and community measures of crime, segregation, socio-economic status and health care provider availability/shortages. The proposed research is significant because it will highlight the value of different home health nursing delivery strategie for improving patient outcomes among vulnerable populations may be achieved. The challenge being addressed--how to best provide safe, effective, and affordable home  health nursing care to diverse patients--affects patient outcomes across the continuum of care from home to  medical home and hospital. Limited evidence is available to guide home health care systems administrators in making decisions about the pros and cons of home health nursing delivery system strategies. The best combination of home health nursing care delivery strategies may be categorically different depending on the presence of informal family caregivers and community supports. Professional home health nursing care and informal (lay) or community care may interact synergistically to increase the effectiveness of systems level intervention, for example, by reducing the intensity of services needed. The comparative effectiveness study proposed will form a critical body of evidence needed to translate effective nursing delivery system strategies into evidence-based practice recommendations that providers, payers, purchasers, policy makers, other principle investigators, and the public can trust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine the relationships among nursing care delivery, the availability of informal caregivers, and patients' race and ethnicity on the health outcomes of older adults. Understanding the reasons for differences in outcomes may lead to improved ways to care for older adults living in the community.",Comparative effectiveness of home care environments for diverse elders' outcomes,9390036,R00HS022406,[''],AHRQ,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R00,2018,248999,0.04213652346329152
"Citizen-Science Technology for HealthyLiving at Home Project Summary Environmental risk factors are attributable to ~50% of the chronic respiratory disease burden in the U.S. and to ~10-15% of the burden from other non-communicable diseases (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes). Exposure to environmental risk factors occurs through various forms of water and air pollution, with a smaller attribution to sources like noise, radiation, and physical hazards. Much of this exposure occurs at home, where people spend 70% of their lives. Yet, the notion that your home should be good for your health is often taken for granted. Homes can be significant sources of harmful pollutant exposure. Indoor levels of established and emerging pollutants, including carcinogens, endocrine-disrupting compounds, criteria air pollutants, and harmful microbes, are often elevated relative to levels measured outside the home. These exposures are important determinants of non-communicable diseases and they are magnified by racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequalities that prevail across the country. Thus, there is a growing need for accessible environmental testing tools and educational programs to create awareness and inspire change in living conditions for improved long-term health. The cost and complexity of existing environmental measurement technologies are in large part why the average household, especially minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, are unaware of the environmental stressors in their place of residence. This Phase I proposal will develop and demonstrate a novel and inexpensive environmental home assessment tool (Home Health Box) for measuring air and water quality in homes. The Home Health Box is a sensor and sample collection system that can be deployed by the home occupant quickly, simply, and with minimal effort. Analysis will include environmental stressors in air (particulate matter, black carbon, metals, volatile organics, mold/bacteria) and water (residual chlorine, metals, bacteria). After constructing and testing the boxes we will deploy them across minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged homes in Fort Collins, CO. Measurement data will be communicated back to the home occupant (with an emphasis on culturally-sensitive design of communications). The Home Health Box will empower individuals to understand, recognize, and mitigate environmental hazards in the home – a place where the majority of exposure tends to occur. Two aims are proposed: (1) Develop a simple, portable sampling and sensor system to quantify environmental stressors using a citizen-science approach and (2) demonstrate performance and value of the Home Health Box concept in a pilot field study of racial and ethnic minority residents in Fort Collins, Colorado. Project Narrative The home is where the majority of one's lifetime exposures to harmful environmental contaminants occurs, and such exposures are disproportionately high in minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged homes. We propose to develop a simple, inexpensive, low-cost measurement system for home environmental contaminants that can be deployed by the home occupant quickly, simply, and with minimal effort. The “Home Health Box” will offer more widespread awareness of environmental hazards in the home to promote healthier living.",Citizen-Science Technology for HealthyLiving at Home,9905210,R43MD014915,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Products ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' Biological Agent ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Carcinogens ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cl element ', ' Chlorine ', ' Colorado ', ' Communication ', ' cost measurement ', ' Cost metrics ', ' Cost Measures ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Water Pollution ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Phase ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' environmental stressor ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' water quality ', ' hazard ', ' checkup examination ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' pollutant ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Airborne Particulate Matter ', ' airborne particulate ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Validation ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' lead contamination ', ' lead contaminated ', ' contamination to lead ', ' contaminated to lead ', ' Pb2+ contamination ', ' Pb2+ contaminated ', ' Pb contamination ', ' Pb contaminated ', ' Endocrine Disruptors ', ' endocrine disrupting compound ', ' Endocrine disrupting agent ', ' Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ', ' Endocrine Disrupter ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Microbe ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' contaminated drinking water ', ' drinking water contamination ', ' racial minority ', ' rural underserved ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ACCESS SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2019,210280,0.022451983346846647
"Nursing Home Care Disparities for Hispanic Medicare Advantage and Fee-For-Service Beneficiaries with Alzheimers and Related Dimentias PROJECT SUMMARY Due to the growing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) among elder Hispanics, the Alzheimer’s Association has emphasized the importance of conducting research to learn more of this con- dition in the Hispanic population. Hispanics have been one of the fastest-growing minority groups among nurs- ing home residents while the number of White residents is decreasing. However, most studies about ADRD care for Hispanics have focused on family caregiving, with very little research about nursing home care. All of the prior research on the care and outcomes of patients with ADRD is derived from patients enrolled in tradi- tional Medicare, with remarkably few studies of persons with ADRD in managed care plans. Even though the Medicare Advantage (MA) program plays a critical role in financing and delivering care for older minorities, es- pecially Hispanics since approximately 40% are enrolled in MA. This raises a critical gap in knowledge be- cause over the past 12 years, the number of beneficiaries enrolled in managed care more than tripled from 5.3 million in 2004 to 17.6 million in 2016. MA plans, which are accountable for their clinical performance, have implemented strategies to improve care, either by selectively contracting with high-performing providers or di- rectly initiating care management strategies for those with complex health care needs. This could be the key to the delivery coordinated, patient-centered, and cost-effective care for people with ADRD. Whether the unique payment and organizational structure of managed care plans translates into differential use and outcomes of nursing home care for minority people with ADRD is unknown. The objective of this R03, the next step in this agenda, is to assess disparities among Hispanics in the quality of ADRD care in a national sample of Medicare enrollees in fee-for-service and MA plans. Our working hypotheses are that, among persons with ADRD, His- panics with ADRD would be more likely to receive care from lower quality long-term care providers, and that managed care would reduce disparities in quality of care. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. To evaluate the quality of nursing home care that serve newly admitted MA and Medicare fee-for-service Hispanic patients with ADRD compared to non-Hispanic whites with ADRD; and Aim 2. To characterize within- and between- nursing home’s disparities in short- and long-stay resident’s outcomes for Hispanics with ADRD. This project will use detailed comprehensive clinical and functional assessment data from all Medicare-certified nursing homes in the US. Our expectation is that this project will provide understanding of disparities in health care quality of formal nurs- ing home care for those with ADRD. Our results can inform Medicare policies that promote better quality of care for Hispanics by understanding the role of managed care plans in lowering racial-ethnic variations. Our contribution is significant since federal policy continues to promote beneficiaries’ enrollment in MA plans with- out evidence about the quality of care for vulnerable populations, such as Hispanics with ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is relevant to public health because it will provide important information on disparities regarding nursing home care for Hispanic Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Medicare Advantage plans integrate the financing and delivery of care, which may be the key to the delivery coordinated, patient-centered, and cost-effective care for people with ADRD. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to redress and identify mechanisms to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities.",Nursing Home Care Disparities for Hispanic Medicare Advantage and Fee-For-Service Beneficiaries with Alzheimers and Related Dimentias,9764226,R03AG054686,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Decision Making ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Incentives ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' managed healthcare insurance plans ', ' managed care plan ', ' managed care insurance ', ' Managed Health Care Insurance Plans ', ' Managed Care Programs ', ' Medicaid ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Managed Care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Policies ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' expectation ', ' payment ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' dual eligible ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' federal policy ', ' family caregiving ', ' family care giving ', ' dementia care ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' hospitalization rates ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,81250,0.02829005234285204
"The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes The National Institutes of Health and the American College of Surgeons recently suggested that one potential explanation for racial disparities in surgical outcomes is that minority and white patients may receive care in hospitals that provide differing quality of care. Few studies have been able to identify the factors underlying the between-hospital quality differences that are actionable targets for intervention through system redesign. Our work focuses on a systems feature given little attention in surgical disparities studies—differences in the nursing resources across hospitals, including registered nurse staffing and skill mix, the percentage of nurses with at least a bachelors in nursing (BSN) degree, and nurse work environments. Despite the large body of evidence linking these nursing features to surgical outcomes, it is not clear whether: 1) differences across hospitals in nursing resources are contributing to observed surgical disparities; 2) whether minority patients, because of differences in relative risk, are more sensitive to limited nursing resources; and 3) whether there are particular combinations of nursing resources that are most effective in reducing disparities. Our study will answer these questions. This application builds upon the successful scientific programs of two research teams: one with unique data and capabilities for evaluating the impact of nursing on surgical outcomes and disparities, and another which has pioneered Tapered Multivariate Matching methods to carefully control for differences in clinical risk between minority and white surgical patients in order to clearly identify the basis of outcomes disparities. We merge these two highly successful programs and combine novel Tapered Multivariate Matching approaches with unique new data on hospital nursing and surgical patient outcomes in over 700 hospitals in four large states to explicitly identify the conditions, in terms of nursing resources, that best serve to reduce surgical disparities. Our first aim is to determine whether and to what extent disparities in surgical outcomes (mortality, failure to rescue, readmissions, length of stay, intensive care use) between minority and white patients undergoing the exact same procedure result from: a) differences between minority and white patients themselves; and b) differences in nursing resources (including nurse education, staffing, skill mix, and the nurse work environment) and other characteristics (e.g., volume) of the often very different hospitals where minority and white patients predominantly receive care. Our second aim will allow us to identify if subpopulations of minority patients (e.g., high vs. low risk; specific procedure/comorbidity combinations) benefit more from specific nursing resource configurations. Our final aim will capitalize on panel data, spanning nearly a decade for over 700 hospitals and the patients in them, to determine whether changes in nursing are associated with changes in disparities—strengthening a case that associations we find in cross-sectional studies may be causal. Better evidence about the relationship between nursing and racial disparities in surgical outcomes can spur evidence-based interventions targeting modifiable aspects of nursing to reduce disparities. Project Narrative Our study focuses on a systems feature given little attention in research on racial disparities in surgical patient outcomes—differences in the nursing resources across hospitals. By using new multivariate matching methods to study patients in a large panel of hundreds of hospitals over nearly a decade, we will separately determine the effects of patient, surgeon, nursing, and hospital characteristics on racial disparities, closely examine the relationship between nursing and disparities in specific procedure and patient groups, and learn whether changes in nursing resources over time have had consequences for racial disparities in surgery outcomes. Our research can translate into interventions tailored to reduce surgical disparities by addressing the mismatch for some minority patients in terms of the specific nursing resources needed to yield the best outcomes.",The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes,9667988,R01MD011679,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Attention ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospitals ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Caring ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"Comparing the Impact of Voluntary and Mandatory Bundled Payments on Disparities in Surgical Care Project Summary This study examines how bundled payments implemented via voluntary and mandatory participation impact access and outcomes among vulnerable patients – evidence needed to inform policymakers about the broader policy impact and whether to scale bundled payments through voluntary and/or mandatory participation. As the largest payer for lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR), one of the fastest growing elective procedures in the country, Medicare has implemented bundled payments in an effort to improve value. However, there are marked disparities in access and outcomes for LEJR. Bundled payments could reduce or exacerbate LEJR disparities for patients who are vulnerable based on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status, and these effects may vary by participation mechanism. Hospitals serving vulnerable patients may be less likely to participate in voluntary bundled payment programs because of perceptions that cost and outcomes are harder to influence among these patients. Different effects may occur among vulnerable patients in mandatory bundled payment programs, in which hospital participation is based on policymaker perceptions about the likelihood of cost savings. As a result, it is important for policymakers to understand whether and how access and outcomes change differentially for vulnerable versus non-vulnerable individuals after hospitals initiate participation in bundled payments. Additionally, understanding how observed effects vary by duration of participation, continuation versus disenrollment in bundled payments, or safety-net status of hospitals are key facets of understanding policy impact. We hypothesize that hospitals in bundled payments will be less likely than non- bundled payment hospitals to be located in markets with a high proportion of vulnerable patients; that compared to non-vulnerable patients, vulnerable patients will have a lower likelihood of receiving elective LEJR after hospitals start participating in bundled payments compared to hospitals that do not participate; and that compared to non-vulnerable patients, vulnerable patients will experience smaller increases in quality and smaller decreases in utilization and cost after hospital participation in bundled payments. Project Narrative One policy intervention for improving the value of lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) among Medicare beneficiaries is bundled payments, which Medicare has implemented among hospitals nationwide via voluntary and mandatory participation. Bundled payments could exacerbate or lessen existing LEJR disparities for patients who are vulnerable based on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic position. As a critical element in determining the broader impact of bundled payments on value and informing policymakers about options for scaling bundled payments nationally, this study will examine how the presence and mechanism of bundled payment participation impact access and outcomes for vulnerable patients.",Comparing the Impact of Voluntary and Mandatory Bundled Payments on Disparities in Surgical Care,9715579,R01MD013859,"['Affect ', ' Black race ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Mandatory Programs ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Savings ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Evaluation ', ' Surgical complication ', ' surgery complication ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' payment ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Surgical Models ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' bundled payment ', ' cost outcomes ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,524162,0.03624042413295991
"A Geographic Approach to Determining the Preventable Causes of US Sepsis Mortality Abstract This AHRQ K08 project employs big data strategies and geographic information system (GIS) informatics and analytics to fill critical knowledge gaps in determining the individual and hospital quality factors that influence sepsis mortality in the US. The training leverages Dr. Jordan Kempker’s Masters of Science and Clinical Research and KL2 training in Social Epidemiology and R programming for data science. Further training will develop practical expertise in GIS informatics for merging disparate data for new risk factor discoveries and GIS analytics to define and account for disease clustering in the determination of individual and systems-based risk factors for US sepsis deaths. To accomplish this goal Dr. Kempker will take coursework a sequence of semester- long courses at the Emory Rollins School of Public Health in the application of GIS in public health and an Emory Faculty Development Course in Health Services Research application. The proposal includes the continued expert, interdisciplinary mentorship of content-expert Greg S. Martin, MD, MSc from Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine; GIS-expert Lance A. Waller, PhD from the Department of Biostatistics; and Social Epidemiologist Michael R. Kramer, MPH, PhD from Department of Epidemiology. The mentored research has 2 Specific Aims: 1) to characterize the geographic correlations among sepsis deaths and the identified individual risk factors for sepsis mortality; and 2) to determine the association between hospital quality in sepsis treatment and sepsis case-fatality at both the hospital- and individual-level. This body of knowledge will build a multilevel understanding of the risk factors for sepsis mortality in the US and infuse GIS techniques into sepsis health services research, identifying new opportunities to create large longitudinal cohorts, connect disparate data sources for new discoveries, account for spatial relationships to improve statistical estimates and create heat maps that direct allocation of public resources to areas of most need. This trajectory of innovative work will inform agendas of public agencies such as the National Healthcare Safety Network, the Joint Commission, National Quality Forum and CMS as well as private sector healthcare systems. It is directly relevant to the impacts of quality measures on hospital outcomes. Finally, this project will build the foundation for at least one future R01 examining further how these factors mediate socioeconomic disparities in sepsis. Project Narrative Sepsis is a major public health problem in the United States and this project aims to use existing national-level big data to identify both: 1) the individual health conditions, behaviors and socioeconomic factors; and 2) the hospital quality factors that contribute to preventable sepsis deaths. Furthermore, this project will utilize geographically coded data to identify the sepsis hotspots in the United States that may benefit from specifically targeted interventions.",A Geographic Approach to Determining the Preventable Causes of US Sepsis Mortality,9727916,K08HS025240,[''],AHRQ,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,150228,0.019656575526408145
"System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care  Over the past decade, the proportion of minority older adults residing in nursing homes (NHs) has increased dramatically and is projected to surpass that of white adults by 2030.1 NHs account for 68% of the $72 billion spent on long-term care in 2008 with most of it funded by Medicaid. These demographic and financial realities create an urgency to understand the needs of minorities in NHs and how systems organization and care delivery in NHs operate to ensure that minority residents maintain quality of life (QoL) and receive quality of care (QoC) equitable to white residents. QoL is a patient-centered measure that captures social, psychological, and environmental well-being. QoC typically consists of staff-reported indicators of care delivery and its related to clinical outcomes (e.g., pressure ulcers). Racial disparities exist in certain QoC indicators, and our recent work for the first time found racial disparities in NH resident QoL. However, those disparities were not based on individual race/ethnicity, but reflected system-wide factors affecting NHs that served more minority residents. Some of these factors are not amenable to intervention, including location of high-minority proportion NHs in poorer areas. There is a need to identify modifiable system-wide mechanisms for these disparities to craft interventions that address them.  Our long-term goal is to develop an intervention for improving QoL for minority NH residents nationwide. To build toward that goal, we designed a multi-method study to examine organizational structures and processes of care in NHs with high and low proportions of minorities, and then assess system-level predictors of NH QoL (primary outcome) and QoC (secondary outcomes) in a unique state-level database with more granular measures as well as a nationally-representative database. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1: Assess and compare, via qualitative methods, the structural, cultural, and process factors influencing QoL and QoC for minority residents among NHs with high, moderate, and low proportions of minority residents. Aim 2: Determine the effect of system-level factors on racial/ethnic differences in NH QoL(primary) and QoC (secondary outcome) using a unique statewide dataset. Aim 3: Using national data from all licensed NHs in the US, test the effect of system-level predictors on racial differences in QoL (primary) and QoC (secondary outcome). Narrative Despite the increase in use of nursing home services by racial/ethnic minority groups, we know little about the needs of minorities in these settings. This project will examine modifiable system- wide mechanisms for nursing home resident quality of care and quality of care for minority older adults. We will use a mixed-methods design with state and national data.  ",System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care,9688122,R01MD010729,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Communities ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Decubitus ulcer ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Patients ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' rurality ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,346862,0.016189992675890604
"A Geographic Information System to Evaluate Disparities in Access to Emergency Surgery Services PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Emergency General Surgery (EGS) constitutes a significant public health burden in the United States. With approximately 3 million admissions a year, this subset of high-risk surgical conditions accounts for 50% of all surgical mortality, despite representing only 11% of surgical admissions. Timely access and presentation to facilities capable of rapid surgical intervention is critical for these conditions, as delays in care are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous research in EGS has identified rural, minority, uninsured and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations as having higher rates of advanced clinical presentation and worse EGS outcomes, raising concerns for disparities in access to emergency surgical services. While it is intuitive that geographic access to care plays a role in EGS outcomes, it is unclear to what degree it interacts with the above socio-demographic factors and contributes to these disparities. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the etiology of disparities in access to EGS. Our central hypothesis is that geographic access contributes to EGS outcomes through interactions with social, patient and disease-related factors in a manner which disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. We will address these hypotheses through the following Specific Aims: (1) We will first develop a national geographic information system to quantify disparities in access to EGS services. Using national census and hospital data, we will generate an interactive map of EGS-capable hospitals, and layer this with distributions of key populations of interest: rural, minority, uninsured and low-income individuals. We will then use advanced spatial modelling techniques to quantify disparities in access to EGS hospitals for these populations and identify regions in greatest need of enhanced surgical capacity. (2) Subsequently, we will combine clinical data with spatial models to determine the contribution of geographic access to disparities in EGS outcomes. Using mixed-effects regression modelling, we will evaluate to what extent improving geographic access would reduce the observed outcome disparities for vulnerable populations. The proposed research represents a novel application of GIS technology to surgical research. The use of geospatial modelling will provide important insight into how geographic access and resource distribution contribute to surgical disparities for time-sensitive EGS conditions. This approach will further enable us to identify specific regions and populations to target for intervention. Finally, the development of a national GIS platform holds potential to inform future EGS regionalization and planning efforts by ensuring equitable distribution of services for vulnerable populations. NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Emergency General Surgery (EGS) represents an important subset of high-risk surgical admissions in the United States, accounting for nearly 50% of all surgical deaths and $28 billion in costs annually; timely access to surgical care is critical for these conditions, as delays are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Disparities in EGS outcomes have been identified for rural, minority and uninsured populations, yet it remains unclear to what degree this is due to geographic access to EGS hospitals. This study will develop a national Geographic Information System to better understand how geographic access contributes to disparities in EGS outcomes for vulnerable populations, and will improve our ability to allocate surgical resources in an equitable manner.",A Geographic Information System to Evaluate Disparities in Access to Emergency Surgery Services,9766399,R21MD012657,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' American Hospital Association ', ' Censuses ', ' Critical Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Health system plans ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Obstruction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' tool ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Perforation ', ' Services ', ' surgical service ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' social ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Institution ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health emergency ', ' surgical research ', ' Systems Development ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' clinical database ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,190625,0.021101254056610154
"Addressing health disparities among understudied women in the deaf and hard of hearing population The purpose of the administrative supplement (NOT-AG-18-039) is to expand existing research to focus on Deaf Women Health. Current widely used NIH-funded patient reported outcome measurement systems (PROMIS) include domains that assess global, physical, mental, and social health from the patient’s perspective. PROMIS is heavily dependent on English, which is a serious barrier to DHH patients who use American Sign Language (ASL) and demonstrate low English proficiency. We addressed this knowledge gap through innovative cross-cultural translation of patient reported survey in ASL and primary data collection from a large representative sample of adults with early deafness. In this administrative supplement for women health, we will follow the same protocol, as in the parent R01, to culturally adapt and linguistically validate women health-related measures. The sample will include 100 DHH mid-to-older women, providing adequate power for group analyses. This is further described in the research strategy section. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PROMIS-Deaf profile is a patient reported outcome measure that is accessible in American Sign Language and English. Such measure that has been validated in these languages will allow future research and clinical trials to include deaf and hard of hearing population without barrier.

"Bilingual and Socio-Emotional Development in Dual Language Learners The U.S. population of dual language learners (DLLs), or children who are exposed to and learning through two languages, has grown rapidly in the last decade. DLLs from low-income families lag significantly behind their monolingual English-speaking peers on school readiness measures at kindergarten entry, and the achievement gap continues to widen with age. Despite the critical role of socio-emotional development (SED) in children's long-term health and achievement, significant gap exists in our knowledge on how bilingual experience shapes SED. By integrating the assessment methods on language, executive functions, and SED, this R01 takes an interdisciplinary approach to study the reciprocal relations between bilingual (English and heritage language) development and SED in a longitudinal study. We will follow 400 DLLs (50% females, initially 3-4 years of age) from low-income Spanish-speaking Mexican American families (N = 200) and Cantonese-speaking Chinese American families (N = 200) annually for three years (T1 and T2 in preschool, T3 in kindergarten). Three waves of multi-method and multi-context data on children's English and heritage language proficiency, executive functions, SED, and quality of parent-child and teacher-child relationships will be collected to address the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the contributions of early English and heritage language development to DLLs' later SED, and test executive functions as a mediating mechanism; 2) Examine the contributions of early bilingual development to DLLs' parent-child and teacher-child relationships, and test relationship quality as mediators between language and SED; 3) Examine cultural differences in DLLs' social relationships, and test whether culture moderates the links between language and relationships; and 4) Test whether other child, family, and school factors moderate the relations between language and SED. The proposed research will contribute to the scientific knowledge on the linking of development across domains (language, executive function, and SED), and have implications for early childhood education policy, assessment, curriculum development, teacher training, and family engagement practice on DLLs. The goal of the study is to examine the bidirectional influences between bilingual (English and heritage language) development and socio-emotional development among dual language learners (DLLs) from low- income Spanish- and Chinese-speaking families. Despite the rapid growth of DLLs in the U.S., the socio- emotional development of young DLLs has been largely ignored.

"Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K-07 award for Dr. Lisa Diamond, a clinician-investigator in the Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The applicant's long-term career goal is to contribute to the policy recommendations needed to eliminate healthcare disparities for cancer patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). Her research is aimed at understanding how clinician non- English language proficiency influences quality of care and outcomes for cancer patients with LEP. The work described in this proposal represents the first evidence-based approach to inform guidelines for the care of cancer patients with LEP. Dr. Diamond's background in health services research, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, through the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program positions her well to accomplish this. Through the proposed career development activities she seeks to gain additional skills towards achieving independence as a scientific investigator with a program of training in large database analysis and its relationship to policy formation, dissemination and implementation research, and the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a widely used rigorous method of coding medical interactions. True language concordance occurs when clinicians are fluent in the language that their patient speaks and reduces disparities among LEP patients. Partial language concordance may adversely impact the quality of cancer care provided to LEP patients. The applicant's research agenda is to gather the evidence to inform national and local standards for the appropriate use of non-English language skills by clinicians. Without standards, LEP cancer patients have the potential to misunderstand diagnoses and treatment recommendations, leading to treatment non- adherence.  Dr. Diamond proposes to accomplish this through the three aims in this career development award. First, she will identify the content of any existing policies on clinician use of non-English language skills and interpreters at hospitals that frequently serve cancer patients and to determine the factors associated with having such a policy. This will be accomplished by surveying the NCI-designated Cancer Centers nationally, the NCI Community Oncology Research Program sites, and minority-serving hospitals in New York City (NYC). Second, she will test the feasibility of using the RIAS across different languages to describe the nature of communication between clinicians and LEP cancer patients presenting for an initial visit at three minority- serving hospitals in NYC. Third, she will assess the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency, non- English language use, and interpreter use on completion of cancer treatment, quality of life, depression, and stress among a population of LEP cancer patients at the same 3 hospitals participating in Aim 2. Through the proposed career development and research activities, the applicant seeks to acquire new skills and knowledge that will complement her existing research abilities in order to improve cancer care to patients with LEP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since many clinicians who provide language concordant care are not native speakers of their patients' languages, studies are needed to help understand the impact of clinician non-English language proficiency on quality of cancer care for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). There are no national or state guide- lines to direct a clinician's decision to use his/her non-English language skills or a professional interpreter with LEP patients. It is critical to gather the evidence for standards addressing when it is acceptable to use one's own non-English language skills with LEP cancer patients and when professional interpreters are essential.",Clinician Use of Non-English Language Skills in Cancer Care,9656968,K07CA184037,"['Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Research Technics ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Wood ', ' Wood material ', ' Work ', ' Diamond ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Competence ', ' Roter ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' health care service organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' health care organization ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' non-English language ', ' skills ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' MSKCC ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Scholars Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' treatment trial ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K07,2019,180036,0.030384904507675333
"Physician Networks and the Racial Gap in Hospital Quality of Care for Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/ Abstract White-black disparities in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) are due in part to differences in the quality of hospitals used by black and white patients, and studies suggest that non-geographic factors play an important role. Such non-geographic factors likely include differences in the physicians caring for black and white patients with CHD. In support of this hypothesis, research has shown that the care of black patients is concentrated within a small number of physicians, who report lower access to specialists and hospitals, and may be more isolated professionally. In addition, research has shown that black and white patients may be treated differently even when they are cared for by the same physicians or physician referral networks. Whether differences among physicians caring for black and white seniors with CHD contribute to the racial gap in hospital quality remains unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize physicians and networks treating black and white seniors with CHD, and to investigate the physician and network factors associated with the racial gap in high quality hospital use using a combination of state of the art social network and econometric data analyses, and surveys directed at physicians caring for black and white patients. The study will include seniors in 35 metro areas with sizable black and white populations and include two cardiac conditions: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), an emergency condition typically requiring transport to the nearest hospital, and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG), a frequently elective procedure involving specialty referral. Study aims will sequentially construct metro-level networks; identify sub-networks of physicians within the larger metro area that are likely to work together (i.e., referral networks); measure network segregation; measure physician and sub-network characteristics that may be relevant for hospital access and the referral process; survey a sample of physicians within these networks to understand self-reported difficulties with the referral process; estimate regression models to assess the effects of physicians and their measured and self-reported characteristics on the white-black gap in high quality hospital use for CHD; and employ simulations to assess potential policy effects achieved by modifying relevant characteristics. The study will address important, previously unanswered questions about physician referral networks for black and white seniors with CHD in diverse US metro areas. Are networks segregated, and to what degree is network segregation correlated with residential segregation? Are characteristics of physicians and sub-networks used by black and white seniors with CHD (e.g., physician qualifications and the centrality of cardiologists within a sub-network) different and do they affect the use of high quality hospitals? The study will address these important research and policy questions. Project narrative / relevance to public health The proposed research is relevant to public health because coronary heart disease (CHD) is highly prevalent in the older population and, given the aging of the population, its consequences on patients’ quality of life and economic burden will only increase. In addition, disparities in CHD treatment have been documented extensively; yet, little is known about the role of physician referral networks in the observed disparities. Upon conclusion of this study we will have a better understanding of how physician and network characteristics influence disparities in the quality of hospital care, enabling policy makers to design targeted interventions aimed at, for example, better physician resource allocation or improving provider-community partnerships.",Physician Networks and the Racial Gap in Hospital Quality of Care for Coronary Heart Disease,9802022,R01HL148420,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Claims Review ', ' Claims Analysis ', ' Claims Analyses ', ' Insurance Claim Review ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', "" Physician's Role "", ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' simulation ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' community partnership ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2019,680938,0.018766167831494478
"Profiles and Progress in Spanish English Bilinguals with Language Impairment: Development of a Criterion Reference Measure PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY We have made significant gains in the correct classification of Spanish-English bilinguals with language impairment though the identification of clinical markers of impairment. Yet a hurdle in reducing the health disparities associated with language impairment in bilingual populations is the need to establish developmental milestones that can serve as the foundation for goal setting and evaluation of progress as a function of language intervention. We know that experiential factors (age of acquisition and language use) interact with bilingual language outcomes. But we do not have a detailed picture of qualitative and quantitative differences between bilingual children with language impairment and their typically developing peers in the semantics and morphosyntax domains. The proposed project will translate the knowledge base regarding clinical markers of impairment, experiential factors, and knowledge of the linguistic systems of English and Spanish to the development of a clinical tool. The focus of the tool is to benchmark language learning in bilingual children growing up in the US context. Thus, the major aim of this project is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and set of probes in Spanish and English. These will be useful for intervention planning and to measure change as a function of language intervention. This tool will target 4-10 year old Spanish English bilinguals with and without language impairment. We will achieve this aim by 1) developing and evaluating an extension of our existing item set; 2) conducting an item tryout study to establish an item set for testing semantic and morphosyntactic performance profiles; and 3) field testing and validating a inventory and probes for profiling patterns of mastery in bilingual children with language impairment that is normed to account for age and language experience. To achieve these milestones, we will recruit 1200 bilingual children between the ages of 4 and 10 years of age from representative U.S. bilingual populations both in regard to dialect and SES. Using a modified matrix model, children will complete a battery of test items that tap key aspects of lexical-semantic and grammatical knowledge in English and Spanish. To make this tool maximally useful in clinical settings, we will program the task to be delivered by computer so that appropriate targets are selected based on the child's age and language experience and that sufficient targets are administered to accurately establish mastery and non-mastery. This research will form the foundation of a clinical tool that can be used by clinicians to establish goals and to document progress as a function of language intervention. This work will further our research in language impairment, especially with bilingual children, because we will document a broad profile of lexical semantic and morphosyntactic skills over a wider age range than is usually studied. The tools developed will also be useful for researchers who need to benchmark children's performance in developmental and intervention studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and probes of Spanish and English development for planning and measuring progress in language intervention. We will translate information about identifying language impairment in Spanish English bilinguals and the relationship between language experience and language growth to develop an item set for identifying patterns of mastery and non mastery of grammatical and lexical semantic targets in 4 to 10 year old bilinguals. This tool that will help clinicians develop and track progress in language invention.

"Bridges to the Doctorate in Nursing for Northeastern Ohio ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in the US have significant impact on the health of Americans. To successfully address health disparities requires increasing the number of scientists from the groups most commonly impacted by health disparities. As the largest group of health care professionals, nurses and nurse scientists have the potential to improve health disparities yet fewer than 2% of American RNs have PhDs. With the current national initiatives related to chronic diseases, the need for self-management, and ongoing health care reform to include team- based primary care, nurse scientists have the potential to make substantial and significant contributions to the science of improving health and to address health disparities. Yet there are too few nurse scientists, particularly from under-represented (UR) groups. The purpose of this project is to increase the number of nurse scientists from under-represented groups by providing a transitional program, bridging master's nursing students from Cleveland State University (CSU) and Ursuline College (UC) into the PhD program at the Frances Payne Bolton (FPB) School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University. Nursing, as a female predominant discipline, faces additional challenges in attaining PhDs beyond that faced by other scientific disciplines. Within MSN and PhD programs, there are increasing numbers of nurses from minority backgrounds, 29.3% and 27.7%, respectively. Despite this increased educational attainment, Schools of Nursing remain with too few nurse faculty from UR groups: fewer than 12% of nurse faculty come from minority backgrounds. The aims of the 5 year project are to: 1. Identify and recruit 5 cohorts of Bridges participants during their master's degree programs, one cohort (n = 4) in each year, and provide mentored research experience (years 1 through 5) 2. Provide joint mentoring by UC, CSU and FPB to Bridges participants (years 1 through 5) with a focus on identifying and addressing the gaps often experienced by students from UR groups to enhance retention and socialization into academic roles. 3. Admit Bridges student graduates from UC and CSU into PhD study at FPB/Case Western Reserve University. To accomplish these aims, have developed a plan to identify and recruit promising MSN students from UC and CSU who are in the MSN programs. We will select 2 students from CSU and 2 students from UC each year for a total of 20 students over the 5 year period. The Bridges students will then be assigned co-mentors, one from their MSN institution and one from FPB CWRU, and participate in paid mentored research experiences while they complete their MSNs. In addition, each cohort of 4 students will receive tailored programming to assist them in addressing needs and challenges that are specific to students from underrepresented groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nurse scientists can contribute to improvements in health disparities but there are too few nurse scientists from underrepresented groups. The intent of this program is to increase the number of nurse scientists by ""bridging"" students from MSN programs at Cleveland State University and Ursuline College into the PhD program in nursing at the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University.

"Health-Professional Education Partnership Initiative (HEPI) - Kenya PROJECT SUMMARY Kenya continues to face a high burden of HIV despite thirty years of health sector and donor attention. To achieve and sustain HIV epidemic control, we propose to train a multidisciplinary workforce of doctors, nurses and pharmacists to design, conduct and disseminate research that can be readily moved from the field into policy and practice to inform HIV prevention, care and treatment. The Schools of Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy at the University of Nairobi, recipient of prior MEPI awards, propose to collaborate with partner medical, nursing and pharmacy schools at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenyatta University, and Maseno University to train both undergraduate and graduate students in team-based research methods, including implementation science and quality improvement. US partners, University of Washington and Stanford University, will contribute their expertise in implementation science training, interprofessional education and gender equality. The first aim will create a 1-year advanced research training certificate for talented graduate students in medicine, nursing, and pharmacy: students, with extensive mentoring support, will train in advanced research methods and will complete a research project at this seminal moment early in their careers. This will allow around 200 future leaders to finish their graduate medical, nursing and pharmacy studies experienced in research methods and implementation science. Our second aim will create a research elective at the undergraduate level for interprofessional teams of students in the 3 disciplines to spend 8 weeks in the field at a teaching hospital developing and completing a quality improvement project. The elective will introduce motivated students to research earlier than the current norm, and will disseminate advanced research methods, mentoring experiences, and team science to teaching facilities around Kenya, focusing on the affiliate clinical faculty in rural areas. Our third aim will institute interprofessional workshops and short courses at the teaching hospital level, involving not only clinical faculty but also county health officials, Ministry of Health (MOH) personnel, and the 4 academic institutions, strengthening leadership, quality of care, and evidence-based approaches while creating denser interprofessional networks. Qualified MOH and affiliate teaching faculty identified in this outreach will have the opportunity to complete the one-year research certificate, further involving field teaching sites in research approaches to public health problems. By integrating this training into both undergraduate and graduate level curricula, this program will be sustainable and expected to continue; this award will allow all 4 institutions to bring research into the undergraduate and graduate curricula for medicine, nursing and pharmacy, and will integrate county health officials, MOH, and affiliate teaching hospitals in research, quality improvement and implementation science to end HIV in Kenya. NARRATIVE To contain HIV in Kenya, we propose to build educational programs and increase HIV research capacity in implementation science and dissemination research at 4 Kenyan universities and their affiliated rural teaching hospitals. The University of Nairobi (UoN) will partner with Kenyatta University (KU), Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), Maseno University, Stanford University and the University of Washington (UW) to implement innovative curricula at all 4 universities for undergraduate and graduate students in medicine, nursing and pharmacy, and provide practice-oriented research skills to clinical faculty and staff through short courses and workshops. There are 3 major pillars of the program: 1) strengthening partnerships, 2) promoting inter-professionalism in research and practice, and 3) translating evidence into policy and practice.",Health-Professional Education Partnership Initiative (HEPI) - Kenya,9788554,R25TW011212,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Certification ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Teaching Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Kenya ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Ownership ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Nurse Training Schools ', ' Nursing Schools ', ' Pharmacy Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Pupil Nurses ', ' Nursing Students ', ' Pharmacy Students ', ' Supervision ', ' Talents ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' SERPINI2 gene ', ' TSA2004 ', ' SERPINI2 ', ' SERPIN12 ', ' PI14 ', ' PANCPIN ', ' MEPI ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Academia ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', ' Data ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Research Training ', ' Seminal ', ' Process ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' dissemination research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Degree program ', ' gender disparity ', ' rural underserved ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI,R25,2019,641518,0.022107195257894025
"The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 10 million Americans are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These dual-eligibles are a disproportionately high-cost population with substantial and often unmet healthcare needs. They are also more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and experience potentially-preventable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits resulting from disparities in access to primary care. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between primary care access and the broader continuum of potentially-preventable hospital care, which includes not only ED visits and hospitalizations, but also observation stays, 30-day return ED visits, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are “safety net” providers that receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations without regard for patients' ability to pay. FQHCs are known to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and quality, but dual-eligibles' use of FQHCs has not been well studied. Moreover, modifiable organizational characteristics that may explain variations in FQHC performance related to reducing disparities are not well understood. Thus, the objective of this study is to characterize and evaluate the role of FQHCs in providing primary care that lowers rates of—and reduces racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care among dual-eligibles. The proposed study has three specific aims: 1) To determine the extent to which FQHCs reduce hospital care relative to receiving care from other primary care providers; 2) To determine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in hospital care are reduced among FQHC users relative to those receiving care from other primary care providers; and 3) To determine the extent to which organizational characteristics enhance the ability of FQHCs to reduce hospital care and related racial/ethnic disparities in care. Using seven years of Medicare claims data (2012 – 2018) rates of—and disparities in—hospital care will be modeled as a function of FQHC use and other primary care sources. The extent to which disparities exist within or between FQHCs will also be assessed. Finally, FQHC-specific hospital care rates will be modeled as a function of FQHC characteristics using Medicare claims and FQHC data from the Uniform Data System. The proposed study is significant, because it will provide evidence of the relative effectiveness of FQHCs at lowering rates of—and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care and identify modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices. The proposed study is innovative because it is the first to examine the relationship between FQHC use and racial/ethnic disparities in the broader continuum of hospital care among dual-eligibles using quasi-experimental methods (i.e., instrumental variable and difference-in-differences analyses) to address selection bias, and the first to model organizational disparities in hospital care rates across FQHCs as a function of FQHC characteristics. This study is expected to have an immediate positive impact for CMS policymakers, state Medicaid agencies, providers (particularly FQHCs), hospitals, and dual-eligible patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to further our understanding of how to use federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to improve access to primary care and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in costly and potentially-preventable hospital care among the dual-eligible population. Moreover, by identifying modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices, the proposed research has the potential to inform improvements in care delivery at low-performing FQHCs. The project is relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities because it focuses on understanding how FQHCs can be used to improve access to care and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities among dual-eligibles.",The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles,10005610,R01MD011513,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Cost Control ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Funding ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,422156,0.006654268418880105
"Disparities in the Outcomes and Processes of Care for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The Role of Differences in the Organization and Delivery of Nursing Project Summary In-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) represent catastrophic, often terminal events and affect up to 700,000 patients annually. Despite the resources and opportunity to intervene early when cardiac arrests occur, fewer than a quarter of patients survive to discharge, and survival varies significantly across institutions and by race. Black patients, in particular, experience up to 12% lower odds of survival and more pronounced neurologic and functional impairment following a cardiac arrest. Disparities in cardiac arrest outcomes are largely attributed to quality gaps at the institutions where minorities receive care. Variations in the process of care delivery in these settings suggests that hospitals where Blacks receive care may be fundamentally different in their ability to detect and prevent death and significant debilitation. Our study will examine institutional mechanisms underlying IHCA disparities through a focused examination of front line care providers. In the hospital, nurses are the primary clinical surveillance system and play an integral role in the initiation and delivery of emergency responses. Nurses are at the bedside 24 hours a day; they are responsible for early warning system monitoring; they have direct knowledge of patient conditions and changes in conditions and are often the first on the scene of a cardiac arrest. The ability for nurses to respond appropriately to acute changes in patient status has been linked to nursing organizational factors, including nurse staffing, nurse education, nursing skill mix, and the nurse work environment. The relationship between the organization of nursing and minority IHCA outcomes, however, is unknown. We posit that nurses play a significant, yet underexplored, role in IHCA patient outcomes, and that variation in nursing across hospitals may help explain IHCA outcome disparities. To examine this relationship, we take advantage of multiple large and unique databases: The American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines–Resuscitation (GWTG-R) clinical registry and the NINR-funded RN4CAST-US studies (R01-NR004513 and R01-NR014855). The clinical registry incorporates uniformly reported and precisely defined clinical variables developed by international experts. Using unique hospital identifiers to link patient outcomes with measures of nursing care from RN4CAST-US, we will identify specific, actionable elements of nursing that influence minority IHCA patient outcomes. The data set that we will assemble includes nurse survey data collected in 2006 and 2015. Using independent cross-sections of tens of thousands of patients in the same large sample of hospitals, enables us to examine trends and relationships between nursing and minority IHCA outcomes and determine if they vary over time. Knowing whether these associations are stable and enduring, in spite of changes in both patient case-mix and acuity and in the nursing characteristics that may be greater in some hospitals than others, will provide stronger evidence that the associations are persistent and that our results are generalizable. Project Narrative Racial disparities in In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (IHCA) outcomes are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By examining the inter-related effects of nursing care organization and delivery, our study will help explain previously unexplored causes of IHCA disparities and inform efforts to improve clinical care in the hospitals that could most benefit from them.",Disparities in the Outcomes and Processes of Care for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The Role of Differences in the Organization and Delivery of Nursing,9716408,R01MD011518,"['Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Nursing Education ', ' defibrillation ', ' Electric Defibrillation ', ' Cardioversion ', ' Cardiac Electroversion ', ' Electric Countershock ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Hospitals ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Process ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' Measures ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' nursing skill ', ' Provider ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' data registry ', ' Emergency response ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' professional atmosphere ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' work atmosphere ', ' job environment ', ' individual patient ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,363027,0.1220984786717387
"Predicting rehabilitation outcomes in bilingual aphasia using computational modeling Bilingualism is an exponentially increasing trend in today's world population due to mass immigration and globalization. Nonetheless, there are no guidelines for the optimal rehabilitation for bilingual patients with aphasia, and this poses a great challenge to reducing health disparities. One of NIDCD's Health Disparities 2009-2013 Strategic Research Plan includes a goal to better treat aphasia in bilingual individuals (http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/plans/strategic/pages/FY2009-13-HDplan.aspx). The current research on this topic, however, lacks specific recommendations on which languages should be trained in a bilingual aphasic individual and to what extent cross-language transfer occurs subsequent to rehabilitation. Factors contributing to the paucity of research in this area relate to the multitude of possible language combinations in a bilingual individual, the relative competency of the two languages of the bilingual individual and the effect of focal brain damage on bilingual language representation. It is, however, unfeasible to examine these issues without undertaking a large scale longitudinal study in this population. As a potential solution, in our previous work, we developed a computational model to simulate language recovery following rehabilitation in bilingual aphasia. Specifically, we trained, lesioned, and retrained a bilingual computational model in order to systematically characterize the effect of AoA, pre-stroke language proficiency, and post-stroke naming output on the rehabilitation outcomes. Results demonstrated that a computational model including these variables was able to capture the many complex profiles that surface in aphasia both before and after intervention. In addition, it was able to predict the extent of cross-language generalization. However, the work of using this model to fully understand bilingual aphasia rehabilitation has just begun. In the proposed project, we extend this work to now examine the predictive abilities of the model and identify the factors that can maximize cross-language generalization. We also extend the architecture and functionality of this model, which was originally developed to simulate Spanish-English bilingual language processing, to Chinese-English which is another language combination commonly encountered in the US and has a strong theoretical and experimental foundation in computational modeling. The proposed work is innovative, because it uses a computational model to predict optimal rehabilitation protocols to facilitate the greatest amount of language recovery in bilingual aphasia. The successful completion of this project is expected to have an important impact on rehabilitation of stroke and bilingual aphasia as well as on the applications of computational modeling. This project is important because it will address the important issue of language recovery following treatment in individuals with bilingual aphasia by using a computational model to predict treatment outcomes in patients. It is predicted that the patients who are treated based on the model's predictions will outperform patients who are trained in the language opposite to the model's predictions, because each treatment plan is customized to that patient's impairment and bilingual language profile. This project will also provide a computational explanation for the hypothesis that different patterns of cross-language generalization in bilingual patients arise from facilitation and inhibition mechanisms on the computational maps. Finally, we will expand the architecture and functionality of the model from Spanish-English to Chinese-English to account for a different language structure. One of NIDCD's Health Disparities 2009-2013 Strategic Research Plan includes a goal to better treat aphasia in bilingual individuals. The proposed work will integrate two complementary scientific approaches (patient-oriented rehabilitation research and computational modeling) to achieve this goal.",Predicting rehabilitation outcomes in bilingual aphasia using computational modeling,9729659,U01DC014922,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Aphasia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Cabbage - dietary ', ' Cabbages ', ' California ', ' Censuses ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immigration ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Recommendation ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Multilingualism ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Celery ', ' Apium graveolens ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Rehabilitation Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' post stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' after stroke ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' focal brain damage ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' patient population ', ' aphasia rehabilitation ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),U01,2019,978365,0.04197659872660885
"PROMIS-Deaf Profile: Inclusion of Deaf Patients in Disability and Outcomes Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current patient-reported outcome measures are heavily dependent on English, which present serious language barriers to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) patients who use American Sign Language (ASL). The availability of patient-reported outcome measures in ASL and English and such that is valid for users of accessible technology and services will provide important insights on improving prevention and treatment models that will lead to better personal and public health within the underserved DHH population. The research plan builds on Dr. Kushalnagar's prior research on communication and quality of life outcomes with deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) population. Communication-related fatigue is relevant to healthcare outcomes. Specific aims include (1) describing the linguistic and internal validity of PROMIS-Deaf profile, (2) examining QoL domains across DHH sub-groups, and (3) evaluating the prevalence of communicative stress and risk factors for health status and generic QoL in a nationwide sample of early-deafened adults. The study will be conducted by a research team that includes: an early career investigator with expertise in quality of life outcomes in DHH population, a senior investigator with expertise in patient reported outcome measures (the creator of the FACIT fatigue QoL measure), a psychometrician with experience in conducting IRT and psychometric analyses for patient reported outcome measures, an audiologist with expertise in (re)habilitative audiology and hearing related outcomes, an ASL translation expert, and a biostatistician. The Advisory Committee consists of experts on the subject matter related to the project and who are nationally known for their work with DHH population. Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that may contribute to poor quality of life frequently observed for individuals with hearing loss. The goals of this application are consistent with the NIDCD 2012-2016 strategies related to improving outcomes for human communication and reducing health disparities, and expected findings will support the development of a future grant proposal for a randomized study that will assess the ability of PROMIS- Deaf profile to detect minimally important changes with intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROMIS-Deaf profile is a patient reported outcome measure that is accessible in American Sign Language and English. Such measure that has been validated in these languages will allow future research and clinical trials to include deaf and har of hearing population without barrier.

"Johns Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions PROJECT SUMMARY The Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions The HCHDS was established in 2002 with funding from the NCMHD-EXPORT Center program and renewed under the COE program in 2006 and 2011. Our primary objective is to be a national resource for advancing the science of health equity and identifying and promulgating solutions for reducing and eliminating health disparities. Based in the Department of Health Policy and Management in the Bloomberg School of Public Health, we promote and encourage health disparities research, training and community engagement using the resources of the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health, Medicine and Nursing. Over the next five years we propose to conduct three major research projects that primarily focus on interpersonal and community-level influences. The cross-cutting theme for these projects is “exploring and addressing the impact of place-based determinants in health disparities among African Americans.” We define place broadly as the physical/built environment, sociocultural environment, and the healthcare system. The physical/built environments include contextual/distal factors that influence outcomes such as household, neighborhood, and community level factors. Sociocultural environment includes family and community norms, social support, social networks, social connectedness, and segregation by race/ethnicity, rurality, socioeconomic status, and language. The healthcare system includes the influence of local healthcare market characteristics, the regulatory environment, and policy level factors.

"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community. The results of this investigation will also provide contemporary insights on how patients who experience heart attacks in the community are treated by physicians.",Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease,9615037,R01HL135219,"['Adoption ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Future ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Coronary Reperfusion ', ' Myocardial Reperfusion ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Caring ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Practice Management ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Prevention ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' ICD-10 ', ' ICD-9 ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Coronary ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Information Technology ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' population based ', ' surveillance data ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,784820,0.017566647793960458
"Microsimulation Modeling to Compare the Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Nondrug Interventions to Manage Clinical Symptoms in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Persons with Dementia Project Summary Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) affects >5 million Americans, disproportionately impacts minority populations, and has significant economic consequences. Two clinical features in particular: functional decline and behavioral symptoms, are associated with more caregiving and Medicare/Medicaid/family expenditures when compared to cognitive decline alone. To help individuals with ADRD remain at home with quality of life, it is vital to provide family caregivers, the largest providers of ADRD care, with effective support. Unlike drugs (e.g., antipsychotics), nondrug ADRD interventions are not associated with adverse events and are recommended as first-line treatments. Systematic reviews conclude that nondrug dyadic interventions that engage the person with ADRD and provide caregivers skills effectively maintain or slow functional decline and/or reduce ADRD-related behaviors. It is unclear as to the effects of these proven programs on outcomes of relevance to families and policymakers (e.g., time spent caregiving) throughout the disease trajectory and whether effects differ by race/ethnicity. Racial/ethnic differences in the use of nursing homes, ability to pay for health care, and family structures may impact population effectiveness of interventions. In response to PAR- 18-331, we propose to use innovative methods in simulation modeling to extend findings from completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on select dyadic interventions. Specifically, we will use our published ADRD microsimulation model (ADRD-MM) to infer the effect of proven dyadic interventions on outcomes of hours caregiving, days in a nursing home, costs, and the person with ADRD’s and their caregiver’s quality- adjusted life-years. We will also evaluate outcomes by race/ethnicity. Our simulation model used data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, the Health and Retirement Study, and Medicare to simulate an incident ADRD case’s decline in function, behavior, and cognition and associated family and policy outcomes. For our proposed study, we have identified eight proven dyadic interventions that meet our inclusion criteria of 1) being tested in RCTs in US community-dwelling persons with ADRD and/or their caregivers and 2) having outcome publications that provided effect sizes and sufficient data to estimate implementation cost. Using the ADRD-MM, our specific aims are to: 1) Determine the effects by race (African American, Asian, and White) and ethnicity (Hispanic) of identified nondrug ADRD dyadic interventions on family hours caregiving, days in a nursing home, costs to families/Medicaid/Medicare, and quality-adjusted life-years of the person with ADRD and their caregivers; 2) compare effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and affordability by race (African American, Asian, and White) and ethnicity (Hispanic) of the identified ADRD interventions; and 3) determine which of the identified ADRD interventions should be tested in additional trials by race (African American, Asian, and White) and ethnicity (Hispanic) to inform nondrug ADRD research prioritization. Our study will yield new data on the impact of nondrug ADRD interventions on societal outcomes and extend the evidence-base of RCTs. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) affects >5 million Americans, disproportionately impacts minority populations, and has significant economic consequences. Systematic reviews of randomized trials conclude that nondrug dyadic interventions that engage the person with ADRD and provide caregivers skills effectively maintain or slow functional decline and/or reduce ADRD-related behaviors; however, it is unclear as to the effects of these proven programs on outcomes of relevance to families and policymakers not included in the original trials. Using our cutting-edge and published ADRD microsimulation model, our proposed study will be the first to compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and affordability of nondrug ADRD interventions by race (African American, Asian, and White) and ethnicity (Hispanic) on outcomes of family time caregiving, days in a nursing home, costs to families/Medicaid/Medicare, and the person with ADRD’s and their caregiver’s quality-adjusted life-years.",Microsimulation Modeling to Compare the Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Nondrug Interventions to Manage Clinical Symptoms in Racially/Ethnically Diverse Persons with Dementia,9624480,R01AG060871,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Family Policy ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Persons ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Paper ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Lifestyle-related condition ', ' Lifestyle-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-Related Disorder ', ' Behavior-Related Problem ', ' Behavior-Related Disorder ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' family structure ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' fictional works ', ' fiction ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Clinical Management ', ' systematic review ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' functional decline ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' life time cost ', ' lifetime cost ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based care ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' evidence base ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,462085,-0.033671051237594195
"Effects of Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model on Racial Disparities in Lower Extremity Joint Replacements Project Summary Hip and knee replacements improve function and quality of life for people with severe arthritis, yet there have been long-standing racial disparities in the use and outcomes of these surgeries. Black Americans are about 40-50% less likely to receive hip or knee replacements (also called lower extremity joint replacements, or LEJR) than whites. Even if they receive LEJR, black patients are more likely to have complications leading to readmissions or death. Despite national awareness of this issue, this disparity persists. In April 2016, Medicare implemented the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, a program that may substantially affect racial disparities in LEJR. The CJR, Medicare's first mandatory bundled payment program, represents an ambitious attempt to move away from the predominant fee-for-service system with the potential to serve as a model for future payment systems. Under CJR, hospitals are accountable for the cost of care for 90 days after patients with LEJR are discharged. An innovative component of CJR is that it is being implemented in 67 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). This design provides a unique opportunity to estimate the causal effect of this payment reform. The CJR program may have a profound effect on racial disparities. CJR does not adjust for patients' socioeconomic status when they set target payment rates. This may lead hospitals to avoid admitting LEJR patients with more complex social service needs during recovery. Since a disproportionately high percentage of those patients may be black, existing disparities in the receipt of LEJR could be exacerbated. On the other hand, once the decision is made to provide LEJR, hospitals and post-acute care providers under CJR face new incentives to work together to improve care coordination for high-needs patients. These changes may reduce racial disparities in post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Our proposed research makes use of the unique randomized design of the CJR program to assess its effects on black-white disparities in LEJR. Our central hypothesis is that CJR increases disparities in the receipt of LEJR, but reduces disparities in the quality of post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Specifically, this proposal aims to assess the effect of the CJR program on black-white disparities 1) in the receipt of LEJR, 2) in post-acute care following LEJR, and 3) in patient outcomes of LEJR. To assess the effects of the CJR program, we will use Medicare claims to conduct difference-in-difference-in- differences regressions to examine the effects of CJR on racial disparities at hospitals located in MSAs affected by CJR relative to hospitals in comparable MSAs elsewhere.

"Effects of Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model on Racial Disparities in Lower Extremity Joint Replacements Project Summary Hip and knee replacements improve function and quality of life for people with severe arthritis, yet there have been long-standing racial disparities in the use and outcomes of these surgeries. Black Americans are about 40-50% less likely to receive hip or knee replacements (also called lower extremity joint replacements, or LEJR) than whites. Even if they receive LEJR, black patients are more likely to have complications leading to readmissions or death. Despite national awareness of this issue, this disparity persists. In April 2016, Medicare implemented the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, a program that may substantially affect racial disparities in LEJR. The CJR, Medicare's first mandatory bundled payment program, represents an ambitious attempt to move away from the predominant fee-for-service system with the potential to serve as a model for future payment systems. Under CJR, hospitals are accountable for the cost of care for 90 days after patients with LEJR are discharged. An innovative component of CJR is that it is being implemented in 67 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). This design provides a unique opportunity to estimate the causal effect of this payment reform. The CJR program may have a profound effect on racial disparities. CJR does not adjust for patients' socioeconomic status when they set target payment rates. This may lead hospitals to avoid admitting LEJR patients with more complex social service needs during recovery. Since a disproportionately high percentage of those patients may be black, existing disparities in the receipt of LEJR could be exacerbated. On the other hand, once the decision is made to provide LEJR, hospitals and post-acute care providers under CJR face new incentives to work together to improve care coordination for high-needs patients. These changes may reduce racial disparities in post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Our proposed research makes use of the unique randomized design of the CJR program to assess its effects on black-white disparities in LEJR. Our central hypothesis is that CJR increases disparities in the receipt of LEJR, but reduces disparities in the quality of post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Specifically, this proposal aims to assess the effect of the CJR program on black-white disparities 1) in the receipt of LEJR, 2) in post-acute care following LEJR, and 3) in patient outcomes of LEJR. To assess the effects of the CJR program, we will use Medicare claims to conduct difference-in-difference-in- differences regressions to examine the effects of CJR on racial disparities at hospitals located in MSAs affected by CJR relative to hospitals in comparable MSAs elsewhere. Accomplishing these aims will provide critical knowledge for payment reforms designed to decrease racial disparities not only in LEJR but in health care more broadly.

"Assessing and Improving Patient Safety Measurement in Nursing Homes Project Summary Nursing homes house vulnerable people who may have physical and psychological limitations and also often lack the financial, political, and social means required for advocacy. To ensure people in nursing homes are safe and receiving high quality of care, public monitoring of these facilities is crucial. A core part of current efforts to monitor and improve patient safety in nursing homes rely on the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS), which contains patient-level health assessments that are self-reported by nursing homes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality measures and five-star ratings based on these assessments suggest progress has been made over the past decade. However, in light of inconsistencies between the MDS and other data sources, and investigations and audits that suggest MDS reporting may be unreliable, it is reasonable to question the integrity of the data and thereby the current federal approach to monitoring nursing home patient safety. We propose to use Medicare and Medicaid claims of nursing home patients to identify health events that led to hospital visits. Our focus will be on four patient safety sections of the MDS, namely falls, pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pneumonia, all of which are generally preventable but without proper care can lead to serious physical and psychological morbidity and mortality. This will allow assessment of the quality of reporting on the MDS, our first aim. The guiding principle here is that while only a portion of the cases that occur in nursing homes would be serious enough to warrant a hospital visit, all cases that result in a hospital visit should be appropriately recorded by the MDS. We will also assess variations in MDS reporting accuracy by patient and nursing home characteristics, with a particular focus on identifying disparities by race and Medicaid enrollment. In our second aim, we will estimate changes in MDS reporting behavior after major injury falls were included in the five-star ratings calculations. In the third aim, we will use the claims to develop alternative measures of patient safety in nursing homes, that is the incidence rates of the more severe cases of these clinical conditions. We will assess the associations between these claim-based rates and other measures of patient safety. In addition to studying these rates and their trends, we will assess variations in incidence rates by nursing home characteristics, with a particular focus on identifying disparities by race mix and proportion Medicaid. Finally, we will describe how current rankings of nursing homes may shift under the claims-based measures. This work will advance safety and quality research for the nursing home care system. It will be a crucial step towards evaluating the effectiveness of current programs and improving future efforts by the public. We will pay specific attention to race and Medicaid payer status in MDS reporting rates and our claims-based patient safety measures to identify disparities, as minorities and the poor may be especially at risk of receiving low-quality care. We expect to provide specific, evidence-based insights that policymakers can use to substantially improve patient safety tools in these settings. Project Narrative To ensure people in nursing homes are safe and receiving high quality of care, public monitoring of these facilities is crucial. A core part of current efforts to monitor and improve patient safety in nursing homes rely on patient-level health assessments that are self-reported by nursing homes, however recent investigations and audits suggest these data may be unreliable. We propose to use Medicare and Medicaid claims of nursing home patients in a validation exercise to assess the quality of self-reporting by nursing homes, estimate changes in reporting behavior following the inclusion of major injury falls in the five-star-rating system, and develop new claims-based patient safety measures for nursing home residents.",Assessing and Improving Patient Safety Measurement in Nursing Homes,9803598,R01HS026957,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2019,394763,0.04719387626403649
"Impact of Bundled Payment Reforms on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hip and Knee Replacement Surgeries Project Abstract: Hip and knee replacement surgeries for elderly Medicare beneficiaries have important clinical implications given their effectiveness for advanced osteoarthritis; and important financial implications given their high volume, expenditure, and expected growth in demand. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the care of these surgeries are well-documented. Our preliminary analysis and other studies have demonstrated that blacks undergo these surgeries less frequently and have poorer outcomes as compared to whites, and that patients from lower socioeconomic strata face greater barriers than those from the upper socioeconomic strata in their access to these surgeries. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) Model, which is a bundled payment reform that bundles/includes most spending related to these surgeries (beginning with the inpatient stay, continuing to post-acute care, and ending 90 days after discharge from the hospital) under a single surgical episode. Hospitals, clinicians and post-acute care facilities are therefore financially incentivized to improve the coordination of care across settings, to keep their spending low and to meet important quality benchmarks. However, experts have raised concerns that in the absence of metrics aimed at reducing disparities, the design of the CJR is likely to exacerbate disparities in hip and knee replacement care across patients of different racial and socioeconomic categories, and across hospitals that serve varying proportions of minority patients. These concerns have considerable face validity, yet the impact of bundled payments in general, and the CJR in particular, on disparities has not been empirically evaluated. In light of these gaps in empirical literature, the aims of our proposal are to evaluate the impact of the CJR on racial and socioeconomic disparities in utilization (Aim 1), inpatient outcomes (Aim 2), and post-acute care outcomes (Aim 3) of hip and knee replacement care. Furthermore, we will identify key mechanisms that influence CJR's impact on disparities, and investigate if the changes in outcomes and disparities that we expect are mediated by the choice of post-acute care facility to which a patient is discharged (Aim 4). The overarching rationale for these aims is that in pursuit of financial rewards from the CJR, hospitals are likely to avoid sicker patients, many of whom are likely to be racial and socioeconomic minorities; and hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities will adopt cost-reduction strategies that may target and adversely influence minority patients, thereby exacerbating disparities. We will conduct rigorous longitudinal analyses using national data to address the specific aims and test associated hypotheses. The knowledge gained from our study will inform the design of current and future bundled payment reforms such that these reforms can prevent the exacerbation of and contribute in reducing existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in hip and knee replacement surgeries."" Project Narrative: The proposed project will evaluate whether the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model of 2016 has exacerbated disparities in the use and outcomes of hip and knee replacement care among elderly Medicare patients belonging to racial minority groups, and to lower socioeconomic groups. The knowledge generated from the proposed study will influence the design of this and other related bundled payment models, such that existing racial and socioeconomic disparities can be effectively reduced. This knowledge will benefit (i) patients undergoing these surgeries in the future by supporting provision of equitable care; (ii) hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities by generating evidence to better understand their responses to this Model; and (iii) policy makers by generating knowledge that will support the design of current and future policy reforms to effectively reduce disparities.",Impact of Bundled Payment Reforms on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hip and Knee Replacement Surgeries,9690458,R01MD012422,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Behavior ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' Minority Groups ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Measures ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' care episode ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' hip replacement arthroplasty ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Adopted ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' metropolitan ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' payment ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' inpatient surgery ', ' bundled payment ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,385000,0.004985963512377208
"Johns Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions PROJECT SUMMARY The Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions The HCHDS was established in 2002 with funding from the NCMHD-EXPORT Center program and renewed under the COE program in 2006 and 2011. Our primary objective is to be a national resource for advancing the science of health equity and identifying and promulgating solutions for reducing and eliminating health disparities. Based in the Department of Health Policy and Management in the Bloomberg School of Public Health, we promote and encourage health disparities research, training and community engagement using the resources of the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health, Medicine and Nursing. Over the next five years we propose to conduct three major research projects that primarily focus on interpersonal and community-level influences. The cross-cutting theme for these projects is “exploring and addressing the impact of place-based determinants in health disparities among African Americans.” We define place broadly as the physical/built environment, sociocultural environment, and the healthcare system. The physical/built environments include contextual/distal factors that influence outcomes such as household, neighborhood, and community level factors. Sociocultural environment includes family and community norms, social support, social networks, social connectedness, and segregation by race/ethnicity, rurality, socioeconomic status, and language. The healthcare system includes the influence of local healthcare market characteristics, the regulatory environment, and policy level factors.

"Bilingual and Socio-Emotional Development in Dual Language Learners The U.S. population of dual language learners (DLLs), or children who are exposed to and learning through two languages, has grown rapidly in the last decade. DLLs from low-income families lag significantly behind their monolingual English-speaking peers on school readiness measures at kindergarten entry, and the achievement gap continues to widen with age. Despite the critical role of socio-emotional development (SED) in children's long-term health and achievement, significant gap exists in our knowledge on how bilingual experience shapes SED. By integrating the assessment methods on language, executive functions, and SED, this R01 takes an interdisciplinary approach to study the reciprocal relations between bilingual (English and heritage language) development and SED in a longitudinal study. We will follow 400 DLLs (50% females, initially 3-4 years of age) from low-income Spanish-speaking Mexican American families (N = 200) and Cantonese-speaking Chinese American families (N = 200) annually for three years (T1 and T2 in preschool, T3 in kindergarten). Three waves of multi-method and multi-context data on children's English and heritage language proficiency, executive functions, SED, and quality of parent-child and teacher-child relationships will be collected to address the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the contributions of early English and heritage language development to DLLs' later SED, and test executive functions as a mediating mechanism; 2) Examine the contributions of early bilingual development to DLLs' parent-child and teacher-child relationships, and test relationship quality as mediators between language and SED; 3) Examine cultural differences in DLLs' social relationships, and test whether culture moderates the links between language and relationships; and 4) Test whether other child, family, and school factors moderate the relations between language and SED. The proposed research will contribute to the scientific knowledge on the linking of development across domains (language, executive function, and SED), and have implications for early childhood education policy, assessment, curriculum development, teacher training, and family engagement practice on DLLs. The goal of the study is to examine the bidirectional influences between bilingual (English and heritage language) development and socio-emotional development among dual language learners (DLLs) from low- income Spanish- and Chinese-speaking families. Despite the rapid growth of DLLs in the U.S., the socio- emotional development of young DLLs has been largely ignored. The proposed work will further our understanding of the interconnections among bilingualism, executive functions, and socio-emotional development and could have implications for early childhood education policy, assessment, curriculum, teacher training, and family engagement practice on DLLs.",Bilingual and Socio-Emotional Development in Dual Language Learners,9825397,R01HD091154,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Language ', ' Chinese American ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Minority Groups ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Temperament ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Policies ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' metropolitan ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' peer ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' kindergarten ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' rapid growth ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 4 years of age ', ' age 4 years ', ' four year old ', ' four years of age ', ' 4 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' evidence base ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Training ', ' faculty development ', ' faculty professional development ', ' instructor training ', ' teacher development ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' curriculum development ', ' minority children ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' cognitive benefits ', ' social relationships ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,593899,0.05691078914910996
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",9981049,U01TR002393,"['Accounting ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Sources ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Complications ', ' post-operative complications ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' functional status ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' simulation ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Institution ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Authorization ', ' Permission ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' Text ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' social health determinants ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' data access ', ' incentive-based program ', ' incentive program ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' readmission rates ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' post-operative recovery ', ' recovery after surgery ', ' recovery following surgery ', ' postoperative recovery ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2020,865989,0.02528670287708964
"Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent racial disparities in neonatal mortality rates are a major public health concern. Black neonates are more than twice as likely to die as white neonates. In previous research in New York City (NYC) hospitals, we found nearly a three-fold variation in risk-adjusted very low birth weight (VLBW) neonatal mortality rates among hospitals and black infants were much more likely to be born at higher mortality hospitals. The factors that influence wide variation in mortality rates among hospitals are not known. Why black women are more likely to deliver at higher mortality hospitals is also unknown. The objectives of this study are: 1) To examine risk- adjusted neonatal mortality among New York City hospitals over the past decade and assess the extent to which variations in hospital quality contribute to VLBW mortality disparities for blacks and Latinos; 2) To use an innovative mixed methods approach to explore processes of care, unit characteristics, patient factors, and organizational factors that explain differences in hospital quality as measured by overall and cause-specific risk-adjusted mortality rates and use of evidence-based practices; 3) To explore patients' perspectives on barriers to receipt of high quality care by exploring barriers to timely care, communication, availability of high risk obstetrics care, knowledge, decision-making regarding delivery hospital, and perception of risk; and 4) To create specific strategies with key stakeholders to promote uptake of best practices at hospitals caring for VLBW infants including patient-centered strategies to minimize barriers to receipt of high quality care. Methods: In Phase 1, we will use NYC Vital Statistics records linked with New York State Discharge Abstract Data to develop a risk-adjusted VLBW neonatal mortality model. We will use this model to rank hospitals based on risk-adjusted mortality. We will then examine the distribution of black, Latino, and white births among hospitals. In Phases 2 and 3 we will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to determine which hospital factors and practice patterns may explain the wide variation in mortality outcomes among hospitals and to explore why black mothers deliver in higher mortality hospitals. We will then convene leaders of obstetrics and neonatologists, hospital quality leaders, community leaders, NYC and State Departments of Health, and patients to discuss our results and explore interventions to improve care for VLBW infants. Information from this study will provide a better understanding of quality in neonatal care in hospitals and reveal specific processes of care that can be improved upon to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant black/white disparities in neonatal mortality rates are partially explained by the fact that black mothers are more likely to deliver in higher mortaliy hospitals. Results from this study will explore why such wide variations in hospital neonatal mortality rates exist and why black moms deliver at higher mortality hospitals. Ultimately, our findings will direct future efforts to reduce racial disparities in neonatal outcomes.",Pathways to Reduce Infant Deaths,9688241,R01HD078565,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' newborn death ', ' newborn mortality ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Nurseries ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' VLBW ', ' very low birth weight ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Knowledge ', ' neonatal demise ', ' neonatal death ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant demise ', ' infantile death ', ' infant death ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' hospital organization ', ' Consequentialism ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' neonate ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' neonatal care ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' perinatal outcomes ', ' surfactant replacement therapy ', ' neonatal outcome ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' antepartum ', ' antenatal ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' hospital performance ', ' obstetric care ', ' ']",NICHD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,480983,0.042361455707270144
"Dulce Digital-COVID Aware (DD-CA) discharge texting platform for US/Mexico border Hispanics with diabetes + COVID-19 Project Summary Hispanics, a group that shows higher type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence, and poor self-management and clinical outcomes, have been disproportionally adversely impacted by COVID-19. The California Department of Public Health reports that Hispanics make up 39% of California’s population but an unprecedented 57% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases. This devastating finding is especially notable on the US/Mexico border. Diabetes has emerged as a leading risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness leading to hospitalization, is associated with greater disease severity and mortality and is an independent predictor of intensive care placement and invasive ventilation. It is becoming increasingly clear that maintaining good glucose control improves prognosis of COVID-19 among people with pre-existing T2D. However, social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at- home/lockdown guidelines may impact one’s ability to maintain adequate glycemic control. Research is needed to evaluate the effect and clinical outcomes of a flexible, easily adopted low cost digital intervention that improves glucose excursions and provides urgently needed COVID-19 mitigation strategies, among rapidly rising groups of high-risk Hispanics with poorly controlled T2D in US/Mexico border communities. Strong evidence from our parent grant Dulce Digital-Me, supports the use of technology (such as text messaging) alone or in combination with coaching interventions as a viable and desired method of delivering tailored diabetes self-management education and COVID awareness messaging to high-risk, underserved populations in a manner that is more convenient for both patients and staff while having the added benefit of being cost-effective for health systems, especially within low resource settings. However, effective interventions may encounter barriers which preclude guaranteed success upon implementation in the real world. This project, taking place along the San Diego/Tijuana border, historically the busiest land port of entry in the Western Hemisphere, will assess the effect of providing an enhanced digital texting intervention-Dulce Digital-COVID Aware (DD-CA) to N = 172 Hispanic patients with T2D upon discharge from a recent hospitalization. Key outcomes will assess the impact of DD-CA on hospital readmissions at 30 and 90 days post-discharge, glucose control and patient reported outcomes at 90 days post-discharge while also assessing COVID status and the implementation process. Given that DD-CA offers the potential to address many of the practical barriers to access and extend the reach of diabetes services, while additionally providing COVID awareness support, it offers an ideal low-cost and flexible solution to reduce hospital admissions and re- admissions in US/Mexico border communities significantly and simultaneously affected by COVID-19 and T2D. Implemented in a typical hospital and post-discharge setting, it augments existing care team processes, thus providing a valuable test of real-world effectiveness. More importantly, by helping to reduce existing inequities in access to diabetes and COVID-19 care, this program aims to improve health outcomes on a larger scale. 8. Project Narrative The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered extremely high hospitalization rates where mitigation strategies are urgently necessary to aid vulnerable Hispanic and Latino populations who are experiencing health disparities as well as high type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence with poor clinical outcomes when compared to non-Hispanic populations. The supplemental Dulce Digital-COVID Aware (DD-CA) intervention addresses specific barriers in diverse underserved Hispanic and Latino communities to improve glucose control and lower transmission of COVID-19 during a highly vulnerable period post hospitalization discharge, to reduce hospital readmission rates. This supplement will integrate COVID educational messaging with glucose management messaging within a low-cost, easily adoptable digital texting platform and offer critical information in a culturally and linguistically relevant manner to address specific barriers in diverse underserved communities.",Dulce Digital-COVID Aware (DD-CA) discharge texting platform for US/Mexico border Hispanics with

"ADVANCE: Assessment of Disparities and Variation for Alzheimer's disease in Nursing home Care at End of Life COVID-19 is a crisis in U.S. nursing homes (NHs), where residents with advanced dementia are at especially high risk of acquiring and dying of the virus. There is an urgent need to understand how to compassionately and effectively care for these residents, maintain communication with family members, and protect the safety of all residents and staff. Prior quantitative research highlighted persistent regional and racial variation in the intensity of care provided to NH residents with advanced dementia, and the pandemic is revealing profound racial disparities in the general population. Little is known about the intersection of COVID-19, advanced dementia, and disparities. ADVANCE (Assessment of Disparities and Variation for Alzheimer’s disease Nursing home Care at End of life), is an ongoing qualitative study that seeks to understand the drivers of regional and racial disparities in care provided to NH residents with advanced dementia. We have identified two high intensity and two low intensity health referral regions (HRRs) (Rochester, NY, Boston, MA, Birmingham, AL, and Atlanta, GA) based on tube-feeding and hospital transfers rates ascertained from recent Minimum DataSet data. Within each HRR, two high and low intensity NHs relative to all NHs in that HRR (16 NHs total) were identified. To date, we have recruited, conducted site visits, and collected extensive qualitative data in 11 of these NHs in 3 HRRs. We have acquired a rich dataset and conducted extensive analysis to examine how NH organizational culture and staff and proxies’ perceptions influence the care residents with advanced dementia receive. The objective of this administrative supplement is to leverage the ADVANCE study infrastructure, with its established relationship to a diverse cohort of NHs and proxies, to explore the experience of residents with advanced dementia during COVID-19 from the lens of health care disparities. Qualitative data will be collected by interview with NH staff and proxy decision makers for NH residents with advanced dementia. Aim 1, will use remote, semi-structured qualitative interviews with NH staff (medical providers, senior administrators, nurses, nursing assistants, and social workers) in the 11 ADVANCE NHs to explore their experiences caring for residents with advanced dementia during COVID-19 focusing on: care processes (testing, controlling transmission, managing COVID-19 positive residents; connecting residents and families); decision-making processes (advance care planning, hospital transfer, communication with proxies); organizational resources (staffing and personal protective equipment); and personal experience (health, safety, and stress). Aim 2, will use remote, semi-structured interviews with proxies of advanced dementia resident (11 Black and 11 White) about their experience during COVID-19 focusing on: connecting with resident, NH response to the crisis, communicating with NH, decision making (advance care planning, hospital transfer), and personal impact (health, coping and stress). IMPACT: The findings of this supplemental research will generate information needed to guide and inform the delivery of equitable and culturally sensitive care to NH residents with advanced dementia during this crisis and beyond. COVID-19 is a crisis in American nursing homes (NHs). We will leverage the unique ADVANCE study infrastructure, with its established relationship to a diverse cohort of NHs in 3 health referral regions (Rochester, NY, Birmingham, AL, and Atlanta, GA) and 40 proxy decision makers (19 Black and 21 White), to conduct semi- structure interviews with NH staff and family members to explore the experience of residents with advanced dementia during COVID-19 from the lens of health care disparities.

"Cognitive Impairment, Multimorbidity, and end-of-life care in older cancer patients PROJECT SUMMARY:  Over 1.5 million individuals reside in U.S. nursing homes (NH); of those, nearly 150,000 have been or will be diagnosed with cancer. The treatment of cancer among NH residents is complicated by the fact that institutionalized older adults are also likely to suffer from cognitive impairment (COG-I) and complex multimorbidity (MM; defined as co-occurrence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and/or geriatric syndromes). Thus, NH cancer patients are particularly susceptible to severe depletion of functional and physiologic reserves, and increased morbidity and mortality. In addition, racial/ethnic disparities across these factors add further complexity to cancer care decisions among NH residents.  Despite these vulnerabilities, very little is known about NH cancer patients’ patterns of cancer care, including incomplete diagnostic evaluation resulting in unstaged cancers, use of cancer-directed treatment, end-of-life (EOL) care, and associated costs. Indeed, there remains a critical need to characterize this patient population and variations in cancer care, especially by gradients of COG-I and MM complexity, and when cultural factors may favor aggressive EOL care. Key questions have yet to be addressed, including: Are unstaged or late-stage cancer in institutionalized older adults observed uniformly across patients with mild or no COG-I vs. those with moderate or severe COG-I? How do these patterns vary by MM complexity? Does EOL care vary by COG-I gradients; by prognosis for poor survival; by race/ethnicity? What are the costs associated with aggressive EOL care?  We aim to investigate the above research questions using the unique, newly developed data resource linking Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), Medicare, and nursing home Minimum Data Set (MDS). To capture cancers with varying case-fatality rates, our study population will include patients with incident or prevalent leukemias, breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, or pancreatic cancer. Our specific aims are to: 1) characterize NH cancer patients by gradients of COG-I and complex MM phenotypes (specific combinations of conditions constituting MM) by patient age, sex, cancer incident status, cancer type, and prognosis, and particularly by race/ethnicity; 2) analyze patterns of unstaged cancer, cancer-directed care, and aggressive EOL care relative to gradients of COG-I, complex MM, patient demographics, disease characteristics, and prognosis; and 3) estimate the costs associated with aggressive EOL care in patients with moderate/severe COG-I, complex MM, and poor prognosis for survival < 6 months.  By addressing the above research questions, we will be able to inform targeted interventions to ensure that dying NH cancer patients receive individualized and dignified care and reduce the costs associated with unnecessary care. Thus, our findings will have a significant impact upon clinical practice and research in geriatric oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  Over 1.5 million individuals reside in U.S. nursing homes (NH); of those, nearly 150,000 have been or will be diagnosed with cancer. Despite the high prevalence of cognitive impairment and complex multimorbidity in NH patients with cancer, very little is known about how cancer care, end-of-life care, and associated costs vary across gradients of cognitive impairment or multimorbidity. This study addresses these knowledge gaps. The findings will inform targeted interventions to ensure that dying NH cancer patients receive individualized and dignified care and reduce the costs associated with unnecessary care.","Cognitive Impairment, Multimorbidity, and end-of-life care in older cancer patients",10119412,P30CA043703,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' leukemia ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER Program ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' nursing intervention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' end of life care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' study population ', ' data resource ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' patient variability ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,404835,-0.02542583180969509
"System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care  Over the past decade, the proportion of minority older adults residing in nursing homes (NHs) has increased dramatically and is projected to surpass that of white adults by 2030.1 NHs account for 68% of the $72 billion spent on long-term care in 2008 with most of it funded by Medicaid. These demographic and financial realities create an urgency to understand the needs of minorities in NHs and how systems organization and care delivery in NHs operate to ensure that minority residents maintain quality of life (QoL) and receive quality of care (QoC) equitable to white residents. QoL is a patient-centered measure that captures social, psychological, and environmental well-being. QoC typically consists of staff-reported indicators of care delivery and its related to clinical outcomes (e.g., pressure ulcers). Racial disparities exist in certain QoC indicators, and our recent work for the first time found racial disparities in NH resident QoL. However, those disparities were not based on individual race/ethnicity, but reflected system-wide factors affecting NHs that served more minority residents. Some of these factors are not amenable to intervention, including location of high-minority proportion NHs in poorer areas. There is a need to identify modifiable system-wide mechanisms for these disparities to craft interventions that address them.  Our long-term goal is to develop an intervention for improving QoL for minority NH residents nationwide. To build toward that goal, we designed a multi-method study to examine organizational structures and processes of care in NHs with high and low proportions of minorities, and then assess system-level predictors of NH QoL (primary outcome) and QoC (secondary outcomes) in a unique state-level database with more granular measures as well as a nationally-representative database. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1: Assess and compare, via qualitative methods, the structural, cultural, and process factors influencing QoL and QoC for minority residents among NHs with high, moderate, and low proportions of minority residents. Aim 2: Determine the effect of system-level factors on racial/ethnic differences in NH QoL(primary) and QoC (secondary outcome) using a unique statewide dataset. Aim 3: Using national data from all licensed NHs in the US, test the effect of system-level predictors on racial differences in QoL (primary) and QoC (secondary outcome).

"Health-Professional Education Partnership Initiative (HEPI) - Kenya PROJECT SUMMARY Kenya continues to face a high burden of HIV despite thirty years of health sector and donor attention. To achieve and sustain HIV epidemic control, we propose to train a multidisciplinary workforce of doctors, nurses and pharmacists to design, conduct and disseminate research that can be readily moved from the field into policy and practice to inform HIV prevention, care and treatment. The Schools of Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy at the University of Nairobi, recipient of prior MEPI awards, propose to collaborate with partner medical, nursing and pharmacy schools at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenyatta University, and Maseno University to train both undergraduate and graduate students in team-based research methods, including implementation science and quality improvement. US partners, University of Washington and Stanford University, will contribute their expertise in implementation science training, interprofessional education and gender equality. The first aim will create a 1-year advanced research training certificate for talented graduate students in medicine, nursing, and pharmacy: students, with extensive mentoring support, will train in advanced research methods and will complete a research project at this seminal moment early in their careers. This will allow around 200 future leaders to finish their graduate medical, nursing and pharmacy studies experienced in research methods and implementation science. Our second aim will create a research elective at the undergraduate level for interprofessional teams of students in the 3 disciplines to spend 8 weeks in the field at a teaching hospital developing and completing a quality improvement project. The elective will introduce motivated students to research earlier than the current norm, and will disseminate advanced research methods, mentoring experiences, and team science to teaching facilities around Kenya, focusing on the affiliate clinical faculty in rural areas. Our third aim will institute interprofessional workshops and short courses at the teaching hospital level, involving not only clinical faculty but also county health officials, Ministry of Health (MOH) personnel, and the 4 academic institutions, strengthening leadership, quality of care, and evidence-based approaches while creating denser interprofessional networks. Qualified MOH and affiliate teaching faculty identified in this outreach will have the opportunity to complete the one-year research certificate, further involving field teaching sites in research approaches to public health problems. By integrating this training into both undergraduate and graduate level curricula, this program will be sustainable and expected to continue; this award will allow all 4 institutions to bring research into the undergraduate and graduate curricula for medicine, nursing and pharmacy, and will integrate county health officials, MOH, and affiliate teaching hospitals in research, quality improvement and implementation science to end HIV in Kenya. NARRATIVE To contain HIV in Kenya, we propose to build educational programs and increase HIV research capacity in implementation science and dissemination research at 4 Kenyan universities and their affiliated rural teaching hospitals. The University of Nairobi (UoN) will partner with Kenyatta University (KU), Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), Maseno University, Stanford University and the University of Washington (UW) to implement innovative curricula at all 4 universities for undergraduate and graduate students in medicine, nursing and pharmacy, and provide practice-oriented research skills to clinical faculty and staff through short courses and workshops. There are 3 major pillars of the program: 1) strengthening partnerships, 2) promoting inter-professionalism in research and practice, and 3) translating evidence into policy and practice.",Health-Professional Education Partnership Initiative (HEPI) - Kenya,10013072,R25TW011212,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Certification ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Professional Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Teaching Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Kenya ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Ownership ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Nursing Schools ', ' Nurse Training Schools ', ' Pharmacy Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Nursing Students ', ' Pupil Nurses ', ' Pharmacy Students ', ' Supervision ', ' Talents ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' MEPI ', ' PANCPIN ', ' PI14 ', ' SERPIN12 ', ' SERPINI2 ', ' TSA2004 ', ' SERPINI2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Academia ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', ' Undergraduate Degree ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Data ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Research Training ', ' Seminal ', ' Process ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Degree program ', ' gender disparity ', ' rural underserved ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI,R25,2020,641518,0.022107195257894025
"Physician Networks and the Racial Gap in Hospital Quality of Care for Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/ Abstract White-black disparities in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) are due in part to differences in the quality of hospitals used by black and white patients, and studies suggest that non-geographic factors play an important role. Such non-geographic factors likely include differences in the physicians caring for black and white patients with CHD. In support of this hypothesis, research has shown that the care of black patients is concentrated within a small number of physicians, who report lower access to specialists and hospitals, and may be more isolated professionally. In addition, research has shown that black and white patients may be treated differently even when they are cared for by the same physicians or physician referral networks. Whether differences among physicians caring for black and white seniors with CHD contribute to the racial gap in hospital quality remains unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize physicians and networks treating black and white seniors with CHD, and to investigate the physician and network factors associated with the racial gap in high quality hospital use using a combination of state of the art social network and econometric data analyses, and surveys directed at physicians caring for black and white patients. The study will include seniors in 35 metro areas with sizable black and white populations and include two cardiac conditions: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), an emergency condition typically requiring transport to the nearest hospital, and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG), a frequently elective procedure involving specialty referral. Study aims will sequentially construct metro-level networks; identify sub-networks of physicians within the larger metro area that are likely to work together (i.e., referral networks); measure network segregation; measure physician and sub-network characteristics that may be relevant for hospital access and the referral process; survey a sample of physicians within these networks to understand self-reported difficulties with the referral process; estimate regression models to assess the effects of physicians and their measured and self-reported characteristics on the white-black gap in high quality hospital use for CHD; and employ simulations to assess potential policy effects achieved by modifying relevant characteristics. The study will address important, previously unanswered questions about physician referral networks for black and white seniors with CHD in diverse US metro areas. Are networks segregated, and to what degree is network segregation correlated with residential segregation? Are characteristics of physicians and sub-networks used by black and white seniors with CHD (e.g., physician qualifications and the centrality of cardiologists within a sub-network) different and do they affect the use of high quality hospitals? The study will address these important research and policy questions. Project narrative / relevance to public health The proposed research is relevant to public health because coronary heart disease (CHD) is highly prevalent in the older population and, given the aging of the population, its consequences on patients’ quality of life and economic burden will only increase. In addition, disparities in CHD treatment have been documented extensively; yet, little is known about the role of physician referral networks in the observed disparities. Upon conclusion of this study we will have a better understanding of how physician and network characteristics influence disparities in the quality of hospital care, enabling policy makers to design targeted interventions aimed at, for example, better physician resource allocation or improving provider-community partnerships.",Physician Networks and the Racial Gap in Hospital Quality of Care for Coronary Heart Disease,9948725,R01HL148420,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass ', ' Aortocoronary Bypass ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ', ' Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ', ' coronary bypass ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance Claim Review ', ' Claims Analyses ', ' Claims Analysis ', ' Claims Review ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', "" Physician's Role "", ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' simulation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' community partnership ', ' black/white disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,702374,0.018766167831494478
"A Geographic Approach to Determining the Preventable Causes of US Sepsis Mortality Abstract This AHRQ K08 project employs big data strategies and geographic information system (GIS) informatics and analytics to fill critical knowledge gaps in determining the individual and hospital quality factors that influence sepsis mortality in the US. The training leverages Dr. Jordan Kempker’s Masters of Science and Clinical Research and KL2 training in Social Epidemiology and R programming for data science. Further training will develop practical expertise in GIS informatics for merging disparate data for new risk factor discoveries and GIS analytics to define and account for disease clustering in the determination of individual and systems-based risk factors for US sepsis deaths. To accomplish this goal Dr. Kempker will take coursework a sequence of semester- long courses at the Emory Rollins School of Public Health in the application of GIS in public health and an Emory Faculty Development Course in Health Services Research application. The proposal includes the continued expert, interdisciplinary mentorship of content-expert Greg S. Martin, MD, MSc from Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine; GIS-expert Lance A. Waller, PhD from the Department of Biostatistics; and Social Epidemiologist Michael R. Kramer, MPH, PhD from Department of Epidemiology. The mentored research has 2 Specific Aims: 1) to characterize the geographic correlations among sepsis deaths and the identified individual risk factors for sepsis mortality; and 2) to determine the association between hospital quality in sepsis treatment and sepsis case-fatality at both the hospital- and individual-level. This body of knowledge will build a multilevel understanding of the risk factors for sepsis mortality in the US and infuse GIS techniques into sepsis health services research, identifying new opportunities to create large longitudinal cohorts, connect disparate data sources for new discoveries, account for spatial relationships to improve statistical estimates and create heat maps that direct allocation of public resources to areas of most need. This trajectory of innovative work will inform agendas of public agencies such as the National Healthcare Safety Network, the Joint Commission, National Quality Forum and CMS as well as private sector healthcare systems. It is directly relevant to the impacts of quality measures on hospital outcomes. Finally, this project will build the foundation for at least one future R01 examining further how these factors mediate socioeconomic disparities in sepsis. Project Narrative Sepsis is a major public health problem in the United States and this project aims to use existing national-level big data to identify both: 1) the individual health conditions, behaviors and socioeconomic factors; and 2) the hospital quality factors that contribute to preventable sepsis deaths. Furthermore, this project will utilize geographically coded data to identify the sepsis hotspots in the United States that may benefit from specifically targeted interventions.",A Geographic Approach to Determining the Preventable Causes of US Sepsis Mortality,9965909,K08HS025240,[''],AHRQ,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,150228,0.019656575526408145
"Predicting rehabilitation outcomes in bilingual aphasia using computational modeling Bilingualism is an exponentially increasing trend in today's world population due to mass immigration and globalization. Nonetheless, there are no guidelines for the optimal rehabilitation for bilingual patients with aphasia, and this poses a great challenge to reducing health disparities. One of NIDCD's Health Disparities 2009-2013 Strategic Research Plan includes a goal to better treat aphasia in bilingual individuals (http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/plans/strategic/pages/FY2009-13-HDplan.aspx). The current research on this topic, however, lacks specific recommendations on which languages should be trained in a bilingual aphasic individual and to what extent cross-language transfer occurs subsequent to rehabilitation. Factors contributing to the paucity of research in this area relate to the multitude of possible language combinations in a bilingual individual, the relative competency of the two languages of the bilingual individual and the effect of focal brain damage on bilingual language representation. It is, however, unfeasible to examine these issues without undertaking a large scale longitudinal study in this population. As a potential solution, in our previous work, we developed a computational model to simulate language recovery following rehabilitation in bilingual aphasia. Specifically, we trained, lesioned, and retrained a bilingual computational model in order to systematically characterize the effect of AoA, pre-stroke language proficiency, and post-stroke naming output on the rehabilitation outcomes. Results demonstrated that a computational model including these variables was able to capture the many complex profiles that surface in aphasia both before and after intervention. In addition, it was able to predict the extent of cross-language generalization. However, the work of using this model to fully understand bilingual aphasia rehabilitation has just begun. In the proposed project, we extend this work to now examine the predictive abilities of the model and identify the factors that can maximize cross-language generalization. We also extend the architecture and functionality of this model, which was originally developed to simulate Spanish-English bilingual language processing, to Chinese-English which is another language combination commonly encountered in the US and has a strong theoretical and experimental foundation in computational modeling. The proposed work is innovative, because it uses a computational model to predict optimal rehabilitation protocols to facilitate the greatest amount of language recovery in bilingual aphasia. The successful completion of this project is expected to have an important impact on rehabilitation of stroke and bilingual aphasia as well as on the applications of computational modeling. This project is important because it will address the important issue of language recovery following treatment in individuals with bilingual aphasia by using a computational model to predict treatment outcomes in patients. It is predicted that the patients who are treated based on the model's predictions will outperform patients who are trained in the language opposite to the model's predictions, because each treatment plan is customized to that patient's impairment and bilingual language profile. This project will also provide a computational explanation for the hypothesis that different patterns of cross-language generalization in bilingual patients arise from facilitation and inhibition mechanisms on the computational maps. Finally, we will expand the architecture and functionality of the model from Spanish-English to Chinese-English to account for a different language structure. One of NIDCD's Health Disparities 2009-2013 Strategic Research Plan includes a goal to better treat aphasia in bilingual individuals.

"System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care  Over the past decade, the proportion of minority older adults residing in nursing homes (NHs) has increased dramatically and is projected to surpass that of white adults by 2030.1 NHs account for 68% of the $72 billion spent on long-term care in 2008 with most of it funded by Medicaid. These demographic and financial realities create an urgency to understand the needs of minorities in NHs and how systems organization and care delivery in NHs operate to ensure that minority residents maintain quality of life (QoL) and receive quality of care (QoC) equitable to white residents. QoL is a patient-centered measure that captures social, psychological, and environmental well-being. QoC typically consists of staff-reported indicators of care delivery and its related to clinical outcomes (e.g., pressure ulcers). Racial disparities exist in certain QoC indicators, and our recent work for the first time found racial disparities in NH resident QoL. However, those disparities were not based on individual race/ethnicity, but reflected system-wide factors affecting NHs that served more minority residents. Some of these factors are not amenable to intervention, including location of high-minority proportion NHs in poorer areas. There is a need to identify modifiable system-wide mechanisms for these disparities to craft interventions that address them.  Our long-term goal is to develop an intervention for improving QoL for minority NH residents nationwide. To build toward that goal, we designed a multi-method study to examine organizational structures and processes of care in NHs with high and low proportions of minorities, and then assess system-level predictors of NH QoL (primary outcome) and QoC (secondary outcomes) in a unique state-level database with more granular measures as well as a nationally-representative database. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1: Assess and compare, via qualitative methods, the structural, cultural, and process factors influencing QoL and QoC for minority residents among NHs with high, moderate, and low proportions of minority residents. Aim 2: Determine the effect of system-level factors on racial/ethnic differences in NH QoL(primary) and QoC (secondary outcome) using a unique statewide dataset. Aim 3: Using national data from all licensed NHs in the US, test the effect of system-level predictors on racial differences in QoL (primary) and QoC (secondary outcome). Narrative Despite the increase in use of nursing home services by racial/ethnic minority groups, we know little about the needs of minorities in these settings. This project will examine modifiable system- wide mechanisms for nursing home resident quality of care and quality of care for minority older adults. We will use a mixed-methods design with state and national data.  ",System Factors and Racial Disparities in Nursing Home Quality of Life and Care,9907866,R01MD010729,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Communities ', ' decubitus ulcer ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Bedsore ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' pressure injury ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' rurality ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,359473,0.016189992675890604
"Profiles and Progress in Spanish English Bilinguals with Language Impairment: Development of a Criterion Reference Measure PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY We have made significant gains in the correct classification of Spanish-English bilinguals with language impairment though the identification of clinical markers of impairment. Yet a hurdle in reducing the health disparities associated with language impairment in bilingual populations is the need to establish developmental milestones that can serve as the foundation for goal setting and evaluation of progress as a function of language intervention. We know that experiential factors (age of acquisition and language use) interact with bilingual language outcomes. But we do not have a detailed picture of qualitative and quantitative differences between bilingual children with language impairment and their typically developing peers in the semantics and morphosyntax domains. The proposed project will translate the knowledge base regarding clinical markers of impairment, experiential factors, and knowledge of the linguistic systems of English and Spanish to the development of a clinical tool. The focus of the tool is to benchmark language learning in bilingual children growing up in the US context. Thus, the major aim of this project is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and set of probes in Spanish and English. These will be useful for intervention planning and to measure change as a function of language intervention. This tool will target 4-10 year old Spanish English bilinguals with and without language impairment. We will achieve this aim by 1) developing and evaluating an extension of our existing item set; 2) conducting an item tryout study to establish an item set for testing semantic and morphosyntactic performance profiles; and 3) field testing and validating a inventory and probes for profiling patterns of mastery in bilingual children with language impairment that is normed to account for age and language experience. To achieve these milestones, we will recruit 1200 bilingual children between the ages of 4 and 10 years of age from representative U.S. bilingual populations both in regard to dialect and SES. Using a modified matrix model, children will complete a battery of test items that tap key aspects of lexical-semantic and grammatical knowledge in English and Spanish. To make this tool maximally useful in clinical settings, we will program the task to be delivered by computer so that appropriate targets are selected based on the child's age and language experience and that sufficient targets are administered to accurately establish mastery and non-mastery. This research will form the foundation of a clinical tool that can be used by clinicians to establish goals and to document progress as a function of language intervention. This work will further our research in language impairment, especially with bilingual children, because we will document a broad profile of lexical semantic and morphosyntactic skills over a wider age range than is usually studied. The tools developed will also be useful for researchers who need to benchmark children's performance in developmental and intervention studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop and validate a criterion referenced inventory and probes of Spanish and English development for planning and measuring progress in language intervention. We will translate information about identifying language impairment in Spanish English bilinguals and the relationship between language experience and language growth to develop an item set for identifying patterns of mastery and non mastery of grammatical and lexical semantic targets in 4 to 10 year old bilinguals.

"Effects of Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model on Racial Disparities in Lower Extremity Joint Replacements Project Summary Hip and knee replacements improve function and quality of life for people with severe arthritis, yet there have been long-standing racial disparities in the use and outcomes of these surgeries. Black Americans are about 40-50% less likely to receive hip or knee replacements (also called lower extremity joint replacements, or LEJR) than whites. Even if they receive LEJR, black patients are more likely to have complications leading to readmissions or death. Despite national awareness of this issue, this disparity persists. In April 2016, Medicare implemented the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, a program that may substantially affect racial disparities in LEJR. The CJR, Medicare's first mandatory bundled payment program, represents an ambitious attempt to move away from the predominant fee-for-service system with the potential to serve as a model for future payment systems. Under CJR, hospitals are accountable for the cost of care for 90 days after patients with LEJR are discharged. An innovative component of CJR is that it is being implemented in 67 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). This design provides a unique opportunity to estimate the causal effect of this payment reform. The CJR program may have a profound effect on racial disparities. CJR does not adjust for patients' socioeconomic status when they set target payment rates. This may lead hospitals to avoid admitting LEJR patients with more complex social service needs during recovery. Since a disproportionately high percentage of those patients may be black, existing disparities in the receipt of LEJR could be exacerbated. On the other hand, once the decision is made to provide LEJR, hospitals and post-acute care providers under CJR face new incentives to work together to improve care coordination for high-needs patients. These changes may reduce racial disparities in post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Our proposed research makes use of the unique randomized design of the CJR program to assess its effects on black-white disparities in LEJR. Our central hypothesis is that CJR increases disparities in the receipt of LEJR, but reduces disparities in the quality of post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Specifically, this proposal aims to assess the effect of the CJR program on black-white disparities 1) in the receipt of LEJR, 2) in post-acute care following LEJR, and 3) in patient outcomes of LEJR. To assess the effects of the CJR program, we will use Medicare claims to conduct difference-in-difference-in- differences regressions to examine the effects of CJR on racial disparities at hospitals located in MSAs affected by CJR relative to hospitals in comparable MSAs elsewhere. Accomplishing these aims will provide critical knowledge for payment reforms designed to decrease racial disparities not only in LEJR but in health care more broadly. Project Narrative/Relevance Black-white disparities in the use and outcome of hip and knee replacements (lower extremity joint replacements or LEJR) have been a major public health concern. This project will assess whether the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model, Medicare's first mandatory bundled payment program, affects black-white disparities in the receipt of LEJR, the quality of post-acute care following LEJR, and patient outcomes of LEJR.",Effects of Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model on Racial Disparities in Lower Extremity Joint Replacements,9850876,R01MD011403,"['Affect ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Awareness ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' surgery complication ', ' Surgical complication ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Recovery ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip replacement arthroplasty ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' metropolitan ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' payment ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Health system ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Medicare claim ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' black/white disparity ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' care costs ', ' bundled payment ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NIMHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,449980,0.01625994374790198
"Impact of Rural Hospital Payment and Delivery Reform on Geographic Disparities in Cancer Surgery Project Summary Cancer patients in rural areas have more limited access to specialized care, are less likely to receive certain treatments, and have poorer outcomes than their counterparts in non-rural areas. Over recent years, many rural hospitals have closed and a high proportion of remaining rural hospitals are in financial distress and at risk for closure, exacerbating barriers to care for rural patients. At the same time, evidence that the volume of surgeries performed in a hospital is associated with improved health outcomes, including mortality, has led to efforts to regionalize surgical care. Although the advantages of regionalization are well documented, referring cancer surgeries to high-volume centers presents challenges for patients, surgeons, and hospitals in rural communities. Against this complex backdrop, the state of Pennsylvania has initiated the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model (PRHM), an innovative program designed to provide hospitals with predictable revenue streams through global budgets and encourage participating hospitals to redesign care delivery to best meet the needs of their communities. This project will assess the impact of the PRHM on access to and outcomes associated with cancer surgery. First, we will examine the impact of the PRHM on regional cancer surgery delivery patterns by examining the location and characteristics of hospitals at which cancer patients receive surgery using statewide hospital discharge data. By decoupling payment from volume, PRHM changes the incentives for providers to perform surgeries locally versus referring patients to regional centers. We hypothesize that patients in areas served by PRHM hospitals will be more likely to be referred to high-volume centers than those in other rural hospital markets. Second, we will assess the effect of the PRHM on cancer surgery access and outcomes using linked discharge and cancer registry data. The PRHM emphasizes changes in care delivery that target improvements in population health, with a focus on access to specialty care. We hypothesize that surgical cancer patients in areas served by PRHM hospitals may experience improvements in receipt of recommended cancer surgery, time to surgery, and related health outcomes, including mortality and readmissions. Third, we will use qualitative methods to understand the PA Rural Health Model implementation process, including its impacts on resource utilization, hospital capabilities, staffing, care delivery, and financial incentives for providers. We will conduct interviews with key informants and focus groups with community stakeholders. Guided by a comprehensive conceptual model derived from implementation science, we will granularly assess the mechanisms by which PRHM succeeded or failed to affect hospital processes and outcomes for surgical cancer care. As the population in areas served by targeted hospitals continues to age, cancer incidence and the demand for high-quality surgical care will increase. Lessons from this context will be highly relevant for informing alternative payment models in rural hospitals and addressing the needs of surgical cancer patients in rural communities throughout the United States. Project Narrative Many rural hospitals are in financial distress and face challenges that contribute to poor access to care and poor health outcomes for cancer patients living in rural areas. This project will assess the impact of an innovative state program, which changes the way rural hospitals are paid and encourages new approaches to health care delivery, on surgery for rural cancer patients. Results will provide timely evidence about strategies to address the needs of surgical cancer patients in rural communities throughout the United States.",Impact of Rural Hospital Payment and Delivery Reform on Geographic Disparities in Cancer Surgery,10048696,R01CA244189,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospital Restructuring ', ' Hospital Reorganization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Health ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' payment ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Site Visit ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' site targeted delivery ', ' targeted delivery ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' implementation science ', ' tumor ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' population health ', ' data registry ', ' improved outcome ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' rural health care ', ' rural healthcare ', ' rural patients ', ' rural dwelling ', ' rural households ', ' rural residence ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' econometrics ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,630625,0.010374795087094964
"Comparing the Impact of Voluntary and Mandatory Bundled Payments on Disparities in Surgical Care Project Summary This study examines how bundled payments implemented via voluntary and mandatory participation impact access and outcomes among vulnerable patients – evidence needed to inform policymakers about the broader policy impact and whether to scale bundled payments through voluntary and/or mandatory participation. As the largest payer for lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR), one of the fastest growing elective procedures in the country, Medicare has implemented bundled payments in an effort to improve value. However, there are marked disparities in access and outcomes for LEJR. Bundled payments could reduce or exacerbate LEJR disparities for patients who are vulnerable based on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status, and these effects may vary by participation mechanism. Hospitals serving vulnerable patients may be less likely to participate in voluntary bundled payment programs because of perceptions that cost and outcomes are harder to influence among these patients. Different effects may occur among vulnerable patients in mandatory bundled payment programs, in which hospital participation is based on policymaker perceptions about the likelihood of cost savings. As a result, it is important for policymakers to understand whether and how access and outcomes change differentially for vulnerable versus non-vulnerable individuals after hospitals initiate participation in bundled payments. Additionally, understanding how observed effects vary by duration of participation, continuation versus disenrollment in bundled payments, or safety-net status of hospitals are key facets of understanding policy impact. We hypothesize that hospitals in bundled payments will be less likely than non- bundled payment hospitals to be located in markets with a high proportion of vulnerable patients; that compared to non-vulnerable patients, vulnerable patients will have a lower likelihood of receiving elective LEJR after hospitals start participating in bundled payments compared to hospitals that do not participate; and that compared to non-vulnerable patients, vulnerable patients will experience smaller increases in quality and smaller decreases in utilization and cost after hospital participation in bundled payments. Project Narrative One policy intervention for improving the value of lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) among Medicare beneficiaries is bundled payments, which Medicare has implemented among hospitals nationwide via voluntary and mandatory participation. Bundled payments could exacerbate or lessen existing LEJR disparities for patients who are vulnerable based on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic position. As a critical element in determining the broader impact of bundled payments on value and informing policymakers about options for scaling bundled payments nationally, this study will examine how the presence and mechanism of bundled payment participation impact access and outcomes for vulnerable patients.",Comparing the Impact of Voluntary and Mandatory Bundled Payments on Disparities in Surgical Care,9960574,R01MD013859,"['Affect ', ' Black race ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Mandatory Programs ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Savings ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' surgery complication ', ' Surgical complication ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' payment ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Surgical Models ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' bundled payment ', ' cost outcomes ', ' econometrics ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,537807,0.03624042413295991
"Community Surveillance of Coronary Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US. Project Narrative  The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community.

"The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 10 million Americans are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These dual-eligibles are a disproportionately high-cost population with substantial and often unmet healthcare needs. They are also more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and experience potentially-preventable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits resulting from disparities in access to primary care. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between primary care access and the broader continuum of potentially-preventable hospital care, which includes not only ED visits and hospitalizations, but also observation stays, 30-day return ED visits, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are “safety net” providers that receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations without regard for patients' ability to pay. FQHCs are known to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and quality, but dual-eligibles' use of FQHCs has not been well studied. Moreover, modifiable organizational characteristics that may explain variations in FQHC performance related to reducing disparities are not well understood. Thus, the objective of this study is to characterize and evaluate the role of FQHCs in providing primary care that lowers rates of—and reduces racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care among dual-eligibles. The proposed study has three specific aims: 1) To determine the extent to which FQHCs reduce hospital care relative to receiving care from other primary care providers; 2) To determine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in hospital care are reduced among FQHC users relative to those receiving care from other primary care providers; and 3) To determine the extent to which organizational characteristics enhance the ability of FQHCs to reduce hospital care and related racial/ethnic disparities in care. Using seven years of Medicare claims data (2012 – 2018) rates of—and disparities in—hospital care will be modeled as a function of FQHC use and other primary care sources. The extent to which disparities exist within or between FQHCs will also be assessed. Finally, FQHC-specific hospital care rates will be modeled as a function of FQHC characteristics using Medicare claims and FQHC data from the Uniform Data System. The proposed study is significant, because it will provide evidence of the relative effectiveness of FQHCs at lowering rates of—and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care and identify modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices. The proposed study is innovative because it is the first to examine the relationship between FQHC use and racial/ethnic disparities in the broader continuum of hospital care among dual-eligibles using quasi-experimental methods (i.e., instrumental variable and difference-in-differences analyses) to address selection bias, and the first to model organizational disparities in hospital care rates across FQHCs as a function of FQHC characteristics. This study is expected to have an immediate positive impact for CMS policymakers, state Medicaid agencies, providers (particularly FQHCs), hospitals, and dual-eligible patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to further our understanding of how to use federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to improve access to primary care and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in costly and potentially-preventable hospital care among the dual-eligible population. Moreover, by identifying modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices, the proposed research has the potential to inform improvements in care delivery at low-performing FQHCs. The project is relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities because it focuses on understanding how FQHCs can be used to improve access to care and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities among dual-eligibles.",The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles,10180779,R01MD011513,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Funding ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Modeling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,224166,0.006654268418880105
"Impact of Bundled Payment Reforms on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hip and Knee Replacement Surgeries Project Abstract: Hip and knee replacement surgeries for elderly Medicare beneficiaries have important clinical implications given their effectiveness for advanced osteoarthritis; and important financial implications given their high volume, expenditure, and expected growth in demand. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the care of these surgeries are well-documented. Our preliminary analysis and other studies have demonstrated that blacks undergo these surgeries less frequently and have poorer outcomes as compared to whites, and that patients from lower socioeconomic strata face greater barriers than those from the upper socioeconomic strata in their access to these surgeries. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) Model, which is a bundled payment reform that bundles/includes most spending related to these surgeries (beginning with the inpatient stay, continuing to post-acute care, and ending 90 days after discharge from the hospital) under a single surgical episode. Hospitals, clinicians and post-acute care facilities are therefore financially incentivized to improve the coordination of care across settings, to keep their spending low and to meet important quality benchmarks. However, experts have raised concerns that in the absence of metrics aimed at reducing disparities, the design of the CJR is likely to exacerbate disparities in hip and knee replacement care across patients of different racial and socioeconomic categories, and across hospitals that serve varying proportions of minority patients. These concerns have considerable face validity, yet the impact of bundled payments in general, and the CJR in particular, on disparities has not been empirically evaluated. In light of these gaps in empirical literature, the aims of our proposal are to evaluate the impact of the CJR on racial and socioeconomic disparities in utilization (Aim 1), inpatient outcomes (Aim 2), and post-acute care outcomes (Aim 3) of hip and knee replacement care. Furthermore, we will identify key mechanisms that influence CJR's impact on disparities, and investigate if the changes in outcomes and disparities that we expect are mediated by the choice of post-acute care facility to which a patient is discharged (Aim 4). The overarching rationale for these aims is that in pursuit of financial rewards from the CJR, hospitals are likely to avoid sicker patients, many of whom are likely to be racial and socioeconomic minorities; and hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities will adopt cost-reduction strategies that may target and adversely influence minority patients, thereby exacerbating disparities. We will conduct rigorous longitudinal analyses using national data to address the specific aims and test associated hypotheses. The knowledge gained from our study will inform the design of current and future bundled payment reforms such that these reforms can prevent the exacerbation of and contribute in reducing existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in hip and knee replacement surgeries."" Project Narrative: The proposed project will evaluate whether the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model of 2016 has exacerbated disparities in the use and outcomes of hip and knee replacement care among elderly Medicare patients belonging to racial minority groups, and to lower socioeconomic groups. The knowledge generated from the proposed study will influence the design of this and other related bundled payment models, such that existing racial and socioeconomic disparities can be effectively reduced. This knowledge will benefit (i) patients undergoing these surgeries in the future by supporting provision of equitable care; (ii) hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities by generating evidence to better understand their responses to this Model; and (iii) policy makers by generating knowledge that will support the design of current and future policy reforms to effectively reduce disparities.",Impact of Bundled Payment Reforms on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hip and Knee Replacement Surgeries,10180776,R01MD012422,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' comprehensive care ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Expenditure ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Measures ', ' care episode ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip replacement arthroplasty ', ' Adopted ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' metropolitan ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' payment ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' inpatient surgery ', ' bundled payment ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,175030,0.004985963512377208
"A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes More than 10 years since the Institute of Medicine's landmark Unequal Treatment report, racial and ethnic disparities in costly and often preventable poor outcomes persist for hospitalized older adults. Evidence points to differences in the hospitals where minorities and whites receive care as a source of disparities. Our original study findings suggest that nursing resource differences (nurse staffing, nurses' educational and skill levels, and nurse work environments) between hospitals may be an important factor underlying racial disparities. Our work thus far however has been restricted to cross-sectional data, preventing us from concluding whether the relationship between nursing resources and disparities is a causal one and whether interventions to improve nursing resources will work as intended. The study we propose in this renewal application takes the important next step to advance policy interventions by using new and unique panel data on hospital nursing and older adult patient outcomes in four large states to evaluate whether differences in outcomes between minority and white patients result from differences between minority and white patients, differences in nursing resources in the hospitals that minority and white patients receive care in, and/or differences in the care minority and white patients receive, even when they are treated in the same hospitals with similar nursing resources. We make efficient use of existing data from repeated cross-sections of hundreds of thousands of patients nested in a panel of over six hundred hospitals at two points in time. This provides a unique opportunity to examine well- known but poorly understood disparities from two distinct but complementary vantage points. First, by examining cross-sections spanning nearly a decade, we gain a better understanding of the role of individual and organizational factors in disparities in older adult hospital outcomes. Importantly, we will learn whether associations between nursing and outcomes disparities in 2015 are similar to those in the same hospital sample in 2006 and whether they differ for whites and minorities. Evidence supporting the stability of associations over time increases our warrant for concluding that connections are causal. Our second aim is to examine hospital-level changes in nursing resources over time, determine whether those changes differed for hospitals predominantly serving minority patients, and determine whether changes in outcomes disparities between minority and white patients result from changes in hospital nursing resources over time. It is important for causation and policy implications to know whether nursing resources improved less in minority serving hospitals. The panel data we will analyze will allow us to assess this, and to determine whether hospital outcomes disparities have grown (or narrowed) and whether nursing resource changes are linked with these changes. Furthermore, we will determine if the changes in nursing resources in minority serving hospitals has contributed to widening or reducing outcomes disparities between white and minority patients. Better causal evidence between nursing resources and patient outcomes can spur evidence-based decision-making. Project Narrative There is evidence that racial and ethnic disparities in hospital outcomes for older adults are, in part, a function of differences in hospitals where minorities and non-minorities receive care. By studying a large panel of hundreds of hospitals over nearly a decade, we will learn whether changes in hospital nursing resources have had consequences for disparities in quality of care and outcomes for hospitalized older adults. Understanding more about the causal links between investments in nursing and disparities in outcomes will inform how to target hospital investments in nursing to maximize safe, effective care for all patients.",A Panel Study of Hospital Nursing Resources and Racial Disparities in Elder Outcomes,9755295,R01AG041099,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Decision Making ', ' Nursing Education ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Paper ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Hospital Nursing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' protective effect ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' policy implication ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' job environment ', ' work atmosphere ', ' work environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' workplace environment ', ' professional atmosphere ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' re-admission risk ', ' readmission risk ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,330050,0.08448846356595224
"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Clinician-Caregiver Communication During Inpatient Pediatric Family-Centered Rounds When admitted to the hospital, Black and Latin(x) children are at greater risk of medical errors, surgical complications, longer, more-costly hospital stays, and mortality compared to White children. Although many factors play a role, poor clinician communication likely contributes to these disparities in health outcomes. Much of the communication between clinicians and parents or family members (i.e., “caregivers”) of hospitalized children occurs during a bedside rounding practice called “family-centered rounds.” To-date, no investigator has examined racial/ethnic disparities in the quality of clinician-caregiver communication during family- centered rounds. The aim of this study is to assess racial and ethnic differences in subjective and objective measures of communication quality during family-centered rounds using caregiver surveys and audio recordings of these encounters. Further, we will explore the relationship between communication quality and disparities in hospital outcomes, including length of stay, pain and symptom control, adverse events, and risk of readmission. This study extends the work of the parent study (REACH Project 2 of U54--REACH Equity, “The effect of a clinician communication coaching intervention on racial disparities in the quality of communication in cardiology encounters”) to a different clinical setting (ambulatory vs. inpatient) and population (adult vs. pediatric), applying similar methodology to assess communication quality. The aims of this project align with the REACH Equity theme by focusing on communication quality in the clinical encounter—a key component of patient-centered care for which racial and ethnic disparities are well-documented. Additionally, the goals of this diversity supplement are consistent with the Center’s aims to identify, mentor, and develop investigators from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. This proposal will support the research and career development of Dr. Parente, providing skills and mentorship needed for her to build a career as an independent investigator. The goal of this research project is to learn more about how doctors talk to parents and family members of children in the hospital. We want to specifically focus on the experience of Black and Latin(x) family members compared to White family members through audio-recordings and family member surveys.

"PediQUEST: Improving Children's Quality of Life through e-PROMS and Palliative Care (Diversity Supplement) PROJECT SUMMARY As principal investigator, I write this administrative supplement to our current trial, Pediatric Quality of Life and Evaluation of Symptoms Technology Response to Pediatric Oncology Symptom Experience (PediQUEST Response) which employs a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) approach to investigate if early palliative care consultation assisted by electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (e-PROMS) and real-time feedback reports improve health related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptom burden in children with advanced cancer as well as parental psychological distress compared to usual care. I plan to add Dr. Ijeoma Julie Eche to our research team as a post-doctoral research fellow for the nearly two-year remainder of the grant period. As an early stage African-American nurse scientist, Dr. Eche is well suited to build a program of research to improve cancer-related disparities in children with cancer and their families. She aspires to be a visionary leader on the vanguard of nursing science as she studies and develops interventions to support families facing pediatric cancer, while also educating the next generation of scientists. To prepare for this aspiration, she has the opportunity to train with me for the next two years, building the foundation and skills for a mentored career development award at an academic center of excellence as she begins her first tenure-track appointment as a nurse scientist. She will engage in didactic and continuing education along with practical experience as a co- investigator on the PediQUEST Response study. Ultimately, Dr. Eche plans to bring her previous and future training to bear on an academic position in which she excels in the tripartite mission of a tier one, research intensive school of nursing as an independent, extraordinary nurse scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE As there is a concerted effort by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve diversity of research workforce by recruiting and supporting eligible investigators from underrepresented backgrounds in health-related research, this supplement leverages the training opportunity and supports the development of a promising early career minority nurse scientist whose program of research focuses on improving cancer-related disparities in children with cancer through a National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)-funded study.

"Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute Project Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death and disability, and also a major contributor to health disparities of those who are elderly, low-income, racial minorities, and reside in urban or rural regions. In order to improve quality of care at trauma centers, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) developed the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP). TQIP collects data from all ACS-verified trauma centers and provides risk-adjusted outcome reports, benchmarked against national averages. The program identifies at-risk populations within hospitals, specifies hospital characteristics associated with patient risk, and facilitates dissemination of best practices among the participating trauma centers. These measures have been associated with significant improvements in trauma patient outcomes. While TQIP provides substantial support to trauma centers, many trauma patients initially present to non-trauma hospitals. In Indiana, for example, the majority (55 percent) of trauma patients received their initial care at non-trauma hospitals, yet no program currently exists to examine outcomes and promote quality improvement at these facilities. Ideally, healthcare providers at such hospitals identify life-threatening injuries, provide initial resuscitation, and rapidly transfer patients to highly specialized trauma centers. The ability of non-trauma hospitals to meet those objectives, however, may be limited by geographic factors, resource constraints, and a lack of clinical expertise. As a result, non-trauma hospitals may harbor variation in quality of trauma care and disparities in health outcomes among their patient populations. Therefore, on-going analysis of non-trauma hospital outcomes and the promotion of best practices represents a critical need within the trauma system. My overall research goal is to optimize the coordination of care and outcomes of severely injured patients within a regionalized system of trauma care. Through this diversity supplement, my training goals are to acquire expertise in implementation research strategies specific to non-trauma hospitals with a focus on 1) stakeholder-centered, qualitative research methodologies; 2) improvement and implementation research methodologies; and 3) program development and maintenance. I seek to accomplish these goals through the following Specific Aims: (1) Engage stakeholders to identify key outcomes associated with optimal quality in trauma care at non-trauma hospitals to inform a modified TQIP process; (2) Develop a dissemination and implementation (D&I) toolkit to facilitate ETQIP-directed quality improvement initiatives that promote optimal trauma care at non-trauma hospitals; and (3) Pilot E-TQIP to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the program. Along with the expertise of my multi-disciplinary mentoring team, the Research Plan proposed in this application will prepare me to obtain R01 funding to support the statewide implementation of E-TQIP to measure its influence on the outcomes of this vulnerable patient population. Project Narrative Despite the substantial resources that have been invested in the advancement of trauma care at U.S. trauma centers, the majority of injured patients still received their care at non-trauma, hospitals – hospitals that receive no such support for improvements in trauma care. The work detailed in this proposal seeks to provide the foundational research necessary for the expansion of the current U.S. trauma system to include outreach to and quality improvement for those hospitals. To achieve these goals, the work includes broad stakeholder engagement, and it utilizes a progressive human-centered approach to program design and implementation.",Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute,10049835,UL1TR002529,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Foundations ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Indiana ', ' Institutes ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Transfer ', ' Patients ', ' Program Development ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' trauma centers ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' outreach ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' minority health ', ' injured ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' trauma care ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Trauma patient ', ' Patient risk ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' racial minority ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' implementation strategy ', ' hospital performance ', ' critical injury ', ' devastating injury ', ' severe injury ', ' ']",NCATS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,UL1,2020,201078,-0.026379451704926175
"Hospital quality, Medicaid expansion, and racial/ethnic disparities  in maternal mortality and morbidity Abstract: Racial and ethnic disparities in maternal adverse outcomes remain a significant public health problem. Studies conducted in New York City (NYC) hospitals have shown that minority women are more likely to deliver in low-quality hospitals and that they are also at a higher within-hospital risk of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) than white women, even after accounting for type of insurance. Although these studies represent important pointers in our understanding of SMM disparities, there are still many open questions about how quality of delivery hospitals drives the higher rates in adverse outcomes observed for minority women. First, it is unknown whether racial/ethnic differences in delivery hospital quality (between and within) exist in cities or regions other than NYC, especially in rural areas. Second, there is little information on the reasons for differences in where women of different racial/ethnic status deliver. Third, previous efforts examining racial disparities in healthcare delivery have mainly focused on individual-level factors overlooking the broader macro-level societal and structural conditions (e.g., structural racism) that may be at play. Finally, it is unknown how important policies such as Medicaid expansion have impacted obstetric hospital quality, especially minority- and rural-serving hospitals. Research studies investigating higher level factors that transcend individual-level factors to explain racial/ethnic disparities in maternal outcomes are urgently needed to design effective interventions. Thus, the proposed study will address the following: 1) Determine the contribution of delivery hospital quality to racial/ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and SMM; 2) Examine within-hospital racial/ethnic disparities in risk-adjusted maternal mortality and severe morbidity and identify whether these disparities are associated with types of medical insurance and broader societal and structural conditions; 3) Determine societal- and individual-level maternal factors associated with using versus bypassing high-quality hospitals; 4) Identify the impact of expanded Medicaid income eligibility to adults earning up to 138% federal poverty level on: (Aim 4a) hospital quality (especially safety-net and rural-serving hospitals); and (Aim 4b) the incidence of maternal mortality and SMM, either overall or by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We will use birth certificate data linked to hospital discharge data and supplemented by other datasets from eight U.S. states from 2000-2019 to develop a risk-adjusted maternal mortality and SMM composite outcome which will allow us to rank hospitals. We will subsequently use hospital ranking to examine the contribution of hospital quality to racial/ethnic disparities. The aim on Medicaid expansion will make use of a natural experiment framework and difference-in-difference analysis resulting in comparing each state to itself, before and after Medicaid expansion. At the end of the study, we will have a better understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in the health care system among all mothers in eight states and will identify potential areas for improvement that can have profound implications on reducing disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will examine to what extent hospital quality contributes to maternal racial/ethnic disparities in eight U.S. states, societal and individual level maternal factors associated with using versus bypassing high-quality hospitals, and whether Medicaid expansion has impacted hospital quality and maternal outcomes.

"Impact of Bundled Payment Reforms on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hip and Knee Replacement Surgeries Project Abstract: Hip and knee replacement surgeries for elderly Medicare beneficiaries have important clinical implications given their effectiveness for advanced osteoarthritis; and important financial implications given their high volume, expenditure, and expected growth in demand. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the care of these surgeries are well-documented. Our preliminary analysis and other studies have demonstrated that blacks undergo these surgeries less frequently and have poorer outcomes as compared to whites, and that patients from lower socioeconomic strata face greater barriers than those from the upper socioeconomic strata in their access to these surgeries. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) Model, which is a bundled payment reform that bundles/includes most spending related to these surgeries (beginning with the inpatient stay, continuing to post-acute care, and ending 90 days after discharge from the hospital) under a single surgical episode. Hospitals, clinicians and post-acute care facilities are therefore financially incentivized to improve the coordination of care across settings, to keep their spending low and to meet important quality benchmarks. However, experts have raised concerns that in the absence of metrics aimed at reducing disparities, the design of the CJR is likely to exacerbate disparities in hip and knee replacement care across patients of different racial and socioeconomic categories, and across hospitals that serve varying proportions of minority patients. These concerns have considerable face validity, yet the impact of bundled payments in general, and the CJR in particular, on disparities has not been empirically evaluated. In light of these gaps in empirical literature, the aims of our proposal are to evaluate the impact of the CJR on racial and socioeconomic disparities in utilization (Aim 1), inpatient outcomes (Aim 2), and post-acute care outcomes (Aim 3) of hip and knee replacement care. Furthermore, we will identify key mechanisms that influence CJR's impact on disparities, and investigate if the changes in outcomes and disparities that we expect are mediated by the choice of post-acute care facility to which a patient is discharged (Aim 4). The overarching rationale for these aims is that in pursuit of financial rewards from the CJR, hospitals are likely to avoid sicker patients, many of whom are likely to be racial and socioeconomic minorities; and hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities will adopt cost-reduction strategies that may target and adversely influence minority patients, thereby exacerbating disparities. We will conduct rigorous longitudinal analyses using national data to address the specific aims and test associated hypotheses. The knowledge gained from our study will inform the design of current and future bundled payment reforms such that these reforms can prevent the exacerbation of and contribute in reducing existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in hip and knee replacement surgeries."" Project Narrative: The proposed project will evaluate whether the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model of 2016 has exacerbated disparities in the use and outcomes of hip and knee replacement care among elderly Medicare patients belonging to racial minority groups, and to lower socioeconomic groups. The knowledge generated from the proposed study will influence the design of this and other related bundled payment models, such that existing racial and socioeconomic disparities can be effectively reduced. This knowledge will benefit (i) patients undergoing these surgeries in the future by supporting provision of equitable care; (ii) hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities by generating evidence to better understand their responses to this Model; and (iii) policy makers by generating knowledge that will support the design of current and future policy reforms to effectively reduce disparities.",Impact of Bundled Payment Reforms on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Hip and Knee Replacement Surgeries,9899752,R01MD012422,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' comprehensive care ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Expenditure ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Measures ', ' care episode ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' hip arthroplasty ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip replacement arthroplasty ', ' Adopted ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' metropolitan ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' payment ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' inpatient surgery ', ' bundled payment ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,385000,0.004985963512377208
"The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 10 million Americans are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These dual-eligibles are a disproportionately high-cost population with substantial and often unmet healthcare needs. They are also more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and experience potentially-preventable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits resulting from disparities in access to primary care. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between primary care access and the broader continuum of potentially-preventable hospital care, which includes not only ED visits and hospitalizations, but also observation stays, 30-day return ED visits, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are “safety net” providers that receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations without regard for patients' ability to pay. FQHCs are known to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and quality, but dual-eligibles' use of FQHCs has not been well studied. Moreover, modifiable organizational characteristics that may explain variations in FQHC performance related to reducing disparities are not well understood. Thus, the objective of this study is to characterize and evaluate the role of FQHCs in providing primary care that lowers rates of—and reduces racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care among dual-eligibles. The proposed study has three specific aims: 1) To determine the extent to which FQHCs reduce hospital care relative to receiving care from other primary care providers; 2) To determine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in hospital care are reduced among FQHC users relative to those receiving care from other primary care providers; and 3) To determine the extent to which organizational characteristics enhance the ability of FQHCs to reduce hospital care and related racial/ethnic disparities in care. Using seven years of Medicare claims data (2012 – 2018) rates of—and disparities in—hospital care will be modeled as a function of FQHC use and other primary care sources. The extent to which disparities exist within or between FQHCs will also be assessed. Finally, FQHC-specific hospital care rates will be modeled as a function of FQHC characteristics using Medicare claims and FQHC data from the Uniform Data System. The proposed study is significant, because it will provide evidence of the relative effectiveness of FQHCs at lowering rates of—and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in—hospital care and identify modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices. The proposed study is innovative because it is the first to examine the relationship between FQHC use and racial/ethnic disparities in the broader continuum of hospital care among dual-eligibles using quasi-experimental methods (i.e., instrumental variable and difference-in-differences analyses) to address selection bias, and the first to model organizational disparities in hospital care rates across FQHCs as a function of FQHC characteristics. This study is expected to have an immediate positive impact for CMS policymakers, state Medicaid agencies, providers (particularly FQHCs), hospitals, and dual-eligible patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it has the potential to further our understanding of how to use federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to improve access to primary care and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in costly and potentially-preventable hospital care among the dual-eligible population. Moreover, by identifying modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices, the proposed research has the potential to inform improvements in care delivery at low-performing FQHCs. The project is relevant to the mission of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities because it focuses on understanding how FQHCs can be used to improve access to care and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities among dual-eligibles.",The Role of Health Centers in Reducing Disparities in Potentially-Preventable Hospital-Based Care among Dual Eligibles,9893723,R01MD011513,"['Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Funding ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Modeling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' dual eligible ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,377727,0.006654268418880105
"Disparities in access to and outcomes of cancer surgery for rural Medicare patients PROJECT SUMMARY Though cancer diagnosis and treatment remain national health priorities, recent gains in cancer care have not been deployed to the benefit of U.S. populations equally, particularly for cancers for which surgery is a primary component of treatment. Rural areas have higher rates of cancer mortality than their urban counterparts, and cancers for which effective screening exists tend to be more prevalent in rural populations. Rural patients undergo fewer cancer-directed surgeries for some cancers and have worse surgical outcomes than urban patients. Surgical disparities could be exacerbated by the continued closure of rural hospitals, potentially limiting access to cancer surgery and specialist care for rural patients. Since 2004, over 400 rural hospitals have closed their doors, and another 430 hospitals are at high risk of closure. Though rural-urban disparities may result directly from these closures and the ensuing lack of access to surgical care, they may also be a consequence of a general lack of economic and social opportunities. In this proposed research, we will explore disparities in access to, treatment for, and outcomes of cancer care using Medicare claims data. While differences in rural-urban outcomes have been examined, the intersectionality of rurality with other sociodemographic characteristics (including racial/ethnic disparities and income) has not been examined for cancers for which surgery is a primary treatment. We will 1) describe this intersectionality in disparities in surgical care for lung, pancreatic, colon, and rectal cancers, 2) estimate the impact of hospital closure on disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes for patients with cancer, and 3) assess the potential effects of policy solutions in maintaining access to care for rural patients, including telemedicine and Medicaid expansion. This proposed work will give us an overarching view into the landscape, current challenges, and potential solutions for rural surgical cancer care. This work will allow us to better understand disparities in care for rural underserved populations, and how geography intersects with race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status to exacerbate differences in access, quality, and outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rural cancer patients have higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes than their urban counterparts, particularly for cancers for which surgery plays an important role in treatment and long-term survival. Rural cancer patients generally travel further distances and have less access to cancer specialists, a problem potentially compounded by increasing rates of hospital closures in rural areas. In this research, we will describe the intersectionality between rurality, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status in disparities for surgical cancer care, estimate the impact of hospital closures on disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes for patients with cancer, and evaluate potential policy solutions to maintain access to surgical cancer care for rural patients.",Disparities in access to and outcomes of cancer surgery for rural Medicare patients,9948356,R37CA248470,"['Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospital Closures ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Postoperative Care ', ' post-operative care ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Productivity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Urban Population ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Uncompensated Care ', ' Link ', ' Rural ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' programs ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer surgery ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' minority health ', ' care burden ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' Medicare claim ', ' screening ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' rurality ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural Americans ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural patients ', ' rural underserved ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' rural cancer care ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Rectal Cancer ', ' Rectal Carcinoma ', ' Rectum Cancer ', ' Rectum Carcinoma ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colon ', ' Economics ', ' ']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R37,2020,682073,-0.025944189435903483
"Assessing and Improving Patient Safety Measurement in Nursing Homes Project Summary Nursing homes house vulnerable people who may have physical and psychological limitations and also often lack the financial, political, and social means required for advocacy. To ensure people in nursing homes are safe and receiving high quality of care, public monitoring of these facilities is crucial. A core part of current efforts to monitor and improve patient safety in nursing homes rely on the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS), which contains patient-level health assessments that are self-reported by nursing homes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality measures and five-star ratings based on these assessments suggest progress has been made over the past decade. However, in light of inconsistencies between the MDS and other data sources, and investigations and audits that suggest MDS reporting may be unreliable, it is reasonable to question the integrity of the data and thereby the current federal approach to monitoring nursing home patient safety. We propose to use Medicare and Medicaid claims of nursing home patients to identify health events that led to hospital visits. Our focus will be on four patient safety sections of the MDS, namely falls, pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pneumonia, all of which are generally preventable but without proper care can lead to serious physical and psychological morbidity and mortality. This will allow assessment of the quality of reporting on the MDS, our first aim. The guiding principle here is that while only a portion of the cases that occur in nursing homes would be serious enough to warrant a hospital visit, all cases that result in a hospital visit should be appropriately recorded by the MDS. We will also assess variations in MDS reporting accuracy by patient and nursing home characteristics, with a particular focus on identifying disparities by race and Medicaid enrollment. In our second aim, we will estimate changes in MDS reporting behavior after major injury falls were included in the five-star ratings calculations. In the third aim, we will use the claims to develop alternative measures of patient safety in nursing homes, that is the incidence rates of the more severe cases of these clinical conditions. We will assess the associations between these claim-based rates and other measures of patient safety. In addition to studying these rates and their trends, we will assess variations in incidence rates by nursing home characteristics, with a particular focus on identifying disparities by race mix and proportion Medicaid. Finally, we will describe how current rankings of nursing homes may shift under the claims-based measures. This work will advance safety and quality research for the nursing home care system. It will be a crucial step towards evaluating the effectiveness of current programs and improving future efforts by the public. We will pay specific attention to race and Medicaid payer status in MDS reporting rates and our claims-based patient safety measures to identify disparities, as minorities and the poor may be especially at risk of receiving low-quality care. We expect to provide specific, evidence-based insights that policymakers can use to substantially improve patient safety tools in these settings. Project Narrative To ensure people in nursing homes are safe and receiving high quality of care, public monitoring of these facilities is crucial. A core part of current efforts to monitor and improve patient safety in nursing homes rely on patient-level health assessments that are self-reported by nursing homes, however recent investigations and audits suggest these data may be unreliable. We propose to use Medicare and Medicaid claims of nursing home patients in a validation exercise to assess the quality of self-reporting by nursing homes, estimate changes in reporting behavior following the inclusion of major injury falls in the five-star-rating system, and develop new claims-based patient safety measures for nursing home residents.",Assessing and Improving Patient Safety Measurement in Nursing Homes,9980349,R01HS026957,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,390409,0.04719387626403649
"Building a Vocabulary: Lexical-semantic Development in Latino Children with Early Language Delay 7. Project Summary/Abstract Spanish learners in the United States (US) are the fastest growing group among children, yet the research base to support their early oral language development in the face of language delay is lacking. To meet this identified research gap, the proposed overall objectives are to examine the specific influence of (a) dual- language learning (DLL) status and (b) caregiver input and interactions lexical-semantic development in children with language delay. Thus, the proposed study seeks to provide a detailed and longitudinal model of lexical-semantic growth in Spanish-learning children in the US who have early language delays and are at risk for language impairment. The central hypothesis is that a multidimensional and precise approach to the assessment of lexical-semantic growth that incorporates DLL status and language delay will be a better model and predictor of later language production than is the widely used single measure of vocabulary size. Further, it is hypothesized that high quality and quantity caregiver language input will predict stronger child outcomes across all multidimensional measures of lexical-semantic growth. Aim 1 takes a multidimensional approach by seeking to document the predictive validity of lexical-semantic breadth, access, and organization on vocabulary acquisition over time in Spanish learners with language delays. Aim 2 investigates the influence of dual- language exposure on lexical-semantic development. Aim 3 assesses the role of caregiver language input and interactions in supporting lexical-semantic growth and ultimately language outcomes. To meet these aims, Spanish-learning Latino children and their caregivers will be studied longitudinally across a well-known period of rapid lexical acquisition in toddlerhood. Lexical-semantic development will be assessed using novel behavioral tasks designed to capture the dynamic interaction between several dimensions (i.e., lexical- semantic breadth, organization, and access) that together support word learning. This approach represents a significant and meaningful contribution to the field because it meets a critical need to describe the specific deficits in lexical-semantic growth for children with LD with dual-language exposure. Importantly, the study examines the mechanism by which caregiver language input supports lexical-semantic growth in predicting later oral language outcomes in Latino Spanish-learning toddlers with early delays. The proposed work is innovative because it represents an interdisciplinary and substantive departure from the status quo by (a) providing a multidimensional understanding of lexical-semantic growth in children with LD, (b) examining Spanish learners in the US along a continuum of dual-language exposure, and (c) studying the caregiver input factors that promote lexical-semantic acquisition. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research has public health implications because it will provide a multidimensional description of the lexical-semantic deficits seen in Latino Spanish-learning toddlers with early language delays and the supportive role of caregiver language input and interactions. This project is of particular relevance to NIH and NIDCD in that it aims to examine health disparities in dual-language learners with language impairments. The integration of a multidimensional approach and rich behavioral assessment in an understudied population will lead to better identification of, and intervention with, children with persistent language delays.",Building a Vocabulary: Lexical-semantic Development in Latino Children with Early Language Delay,9977530,K23DC018033,"['Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Semantics ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Latino ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Nature ', ' Dimensions ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Risk Marker ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' lexical ', ' reading deficiency ', ' reading deficit ', ' reading difficulties ', ' word learning ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' language impairment ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,K23,2020,196076,0.018673088133950428
