"Ethnic and Gender Influences on Helpseeking in Dementia This proposal refers to Racial/Ethnic Differences and Health Disparities; Research to disentangle the effects of socioeconomic status, social and environment factors, health behaviors and race and ethnicity on health.  In order to meet the health needs of our growing ethnic minority elderly population, on of NIA's strategic goals for the next decade is to improve interventions and services for minority elderly with dementia and their caregivers.  Interventions and services must be accessible to be effective. Surprisingly little research has examined help-seeking processes in dementia as a way to improve service access and thereby reduce health care disparities for minorities and women.  This proposal seek funding for an in-depth, comparative qualitative study of help-seeking and barriers to care for dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral problems.  This study focuses on dementia neuropsychiatric symptoms because they are among the most difficult problems caregivers face in providing care to a loved one with dementia and are associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Spousal caregivers and primary care clinicians of Mexican-American (n=32) and White non-Hispanic (n=32) elderly with dementia will be recruited from the UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center and from an on- going epidemiological study.  Specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) to examine the impact of ethnicity and gender on explanatory models, help-seeking behaviors, and treatment preferences for dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms, 2) to systematically compare spousal caregiver perspectives with those of the primary care clinician who is caring for the dementia-affected elderly, and 3) to develop hypotheses about factors that influence help-seeking patterns and barriers to care for dementia mental and behavioral disturbances.  In addition, this research aims to advance basic behavioral science theory and methods for help- seeking processes that may be applied to other conditions.  The hypotheses generated by pilot study will be investigated in a larger, multi- site, longitudinal quantitative and/or qualitative study funded through the R01 funding mechanism.

"Dementia and Disability in Thai Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Dementia is becoming increasingly common in underdeveloped societies. Methods for detecting, diagnosing, and treating dementia appropriate for application in developing economies is critically important to avoid the emergence of health disparities in care of dementia patients. The Dementia and Disability in Thai Elderly Project (DDP) unites the expertise of the UCLA Alzheimer's Disease Center and the Neurodegenerative Disease and Behavioral Neurology Section of the Division of Neurology of Mahidol University to respond to a newly instituted public health mandate (the Rehabilitation and Disabled Persons Act, BE2534) requiring that each university or medical center take responsibility for the care of patients in their assigned catchment areas in Bangkok. This research will be done primarily in Thailand at Mahidol University in collaboration with Vorapun Senanarong, M.D. as an extension of NIH grant #P50 AG16570. The methodology proposed in the DDP has been accepted by the individual responsible for the Mahidol catchment area, Professor Udom Kachitorn, as the means of detecting and characterizing dementia and disability in Thai elderly. Two thousand-six hundred fifty Thai elderly live in the catchment area and will be screened over a 6-month period in temples, schools, and elderly clubs. We anticipate the identification of 130 individuals with dementia and 450 individuals with cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND). These patients will be assessed to determine the cause of the dementia and cognitive impairment. These patients plus 100 non-demented, non-disabled controls will be reassessed 1 year later. We hypothesize that the Thai Activities of Daily Living scale will detect disability in 40% of Thai elderly; dementia will be present in 5% of Thai elderly; Alzheimer's disease will account for 60% of the dementia detected in Thai elderly; CIND will be present in 17% of Thai elderly, the 1-year incidence of dementia will be present in those with CIND at baseline; patients with dementia at baseline will exhibit a cognitive decline of 4 Thai Mental Status Examination points per year; and disability will be highly correlated with cognitive deterioration. The phases of the study (training, screening, assessment, and follow-up) will be completed over a 3-year period. Our program is ambitious and substantial cost sharing will be undertaken by Mahidol University. The outcomes of this study are critically important for public health planning of the needs of disabled and cognitively impaired urban Thai elderly. The DDP will serve as a model for the implementation for disability and dementia screening in other catchment areas of Bangkok.

"Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimers Disease DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The African American community has been under-represented in the search for etiologic factors for Alzheimer's disease CAD), despite data showing increased incidence in this ethnic population and evidence that African Americans may have a different constellation of risk factors than those identified in Caucasians. To elucidate genetic risk factors in this population, we propose a clinic-based case-control study of AD in Detroit, Michigan, using 500 cases and 600 controls. In contrast to previous studies limited by small sample sizes, we have a unique opportunity to collect a large African American case control series through our collaboration with the Henry Ford Health System, Health Alliance Plan (HAP), which insures over 500,000 members in southeastern Michigan. We will collect cases from the Neurology Clinic that is part of the Henry Ford Medical Group in Detroit, which sees over 250 new African American AD HAP members per year. The HAP database also provides a large pool of eligible African American controls residing in the same region and seeking care at the same HF clinics. We will focus our investigation on genes related to vascular mechanisms, considering the evidence for shared risk factors for vascular disease and AD; the evidence of common pathogenic pathways for AD and vascular disorders; and the observed overlap of cerebrovascular disease among AD patients upon imaging and at autopsy. This overlap is notably greater among African American patients, possibly leading to earlier clinical presentation and increased severity of disease.  Our specific aims are: (1) Collect and evaluate data for 500 cases / 600 controls from HAP, including vascular risk factors, serum protein levels, clinical vascular measurements, and white matter measurements from MRI (cases + subset of 200 controls); (2) Measure SNP and haplotype variation in 10 vascular candidate genes (6-10 SNPs per gene); (3) Compare candidate gene variation between cases and controls, between vascular strata within AD, and between AD cases and controls, stratified by vascular status; and (4) Explore the genetic influence on intermediate vascular factors within and among cases and controls. We will also genotype a set of 50 SNPs located throughout the genome to provide a 'stratification panel' to assess potential confounding due to admixture and to detect genetic outliers within cases or controls. This study, including a detailed analysis of white matter changes, assessment of vascular and other important AD risk factors, use of emerging SNP technologies and statistical methods, and development of new statistical methodology, will provide a more powerful and rigorous genetic approach than previous candidate gene case-control studies. Further, the imaging results will be of great interest clinically, as very few imaging projects of this kind have been carried out in an African American population.

"Outcomes and Predictors in Mild Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in aging-related patient-oriented research. The candidate is a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh with an established track record as a researcher, clinician, and educator. The proposed research is focused on Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a variably defined condition generally regarded as a prodromal and/or risk state for AIzheimer's and other dementias. Its basic premise is that current ""diagnostic"" criteria for MCI do not reflect the real-world distribution and outcomes in older adults in the typical community or clinical setting. In particular, MCI may be unstable and heterogeneous especially in patients with significant comorbidity and on multiple medications. The aims of the Research Plan are to refine the criteria and propose new ones developed from: (1) analysis of existing data on MCI from a completed 15-year longitudinal community-based study of an aging cohort, and (2) an added focus on MCI in an ongoing study of older primary care patients. The refined criteria will be applied to (3) a new multicenter cohort study, for which methods and criteria will be derived from the preceding two components and pilot data will be collected during the K24.   The Mentoring Plan is targeted towards beginning clinician investigators with excellent clinical and academic backgrounds and a commitment to clinical research in dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Trainees will obtain hands-on experience of patient-oriented research by conducting research assessments of patients participating in the ongoing primary care study (part 2 above), under supervision by the K24 awardee, and participating in the multidisciplinary consensus diagnosis conferences. They will also obtain supervised experience of analyzing, interpreting, and reporting data from the completed community study (part 1 above) for publication. A range of additional didactic and experiential programs is available depending on their interests and previous background. Each trainee will develop an independent research project application as part of the training and be evaluated on acquired knowledge, skills, and productivity.

"Detection of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease by fMRI  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is preceded by a period when detectable changes in brain function occur without warning symptoms. This period may be twenty years or longer. Activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging is reduced during confrontation naming in normal women who have increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, at an average age of only 53 years. These same individuals have reduced activation in the posterior cingulate cortex during a memorization task, among other disparities. Our hypothesis is that the altered functional MRI responses in naming, working memory and memorization will quantifiably worsen with age, due to progressive underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology. Disease-modifying treatments applied in this early, pre-symptomatic stage of AD could have profound impact, by preventing the onset of cognitive symptoms. Millions are currently being spent on large-scale prevention trials, with AD symptoms as end-points. By providing a biomarker of pre-symptomatic AD progression, fMRI could potentially reduce the duration and costs of such trials. This continuation proposal is designed to detect changes in brain function in high-AD risk individuals over time. We will study normal education-matched groups of high- and low-AD risk subjects in the age ranges 40-65 and 65-90 years, using fMRI stimulus tasks which have previously demonstrated regional disparities in high-AD risk individuals. In addition, we will repeat the naming and fluency fMRI studies performed previously in high- and low-AD risk individuals after an interval of five years, in order to detect longitudinal changes in activation. The convergence of evidence from these cross-sectional and longitudinal studies could provide powerful evidence for a model of Alzheimer's disease as a relentless, slowly progressive brain pathology that begins early in adult life, but remains compensated until it produces clinical symptoms in its late stages.

"APOE Genotype in Brazilian Children with Early Diarrhea DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Having defined the magnitude, major new etiologies, key novel mechanisms and short-term and long-term impact of persistent and recurring diarrheal illnesses on cognitive development in a model collaboration and cohort of children born into active prospective surveillance in poor urban areas (shanty-towns) in Northeast Brazil, we now have a unique opportunity to better assign causal relationships by establishing the importance of genetic markers in defining risk, plan prevention strategies for future interventions, and build sustainable human genetic research together with environmental assessment.  This proposal directly addresses potentially remediable mechanisms of long-term cognitive impairment, which we have calculated more than doubles the DALY impact of early childhood diarrheal illnesses worldwide.  We postulate, based on our previous cognitive outcome data, that the greatest long-term impact will occur in children with persistent and recurring diarrheal illnesses carrying APOE4 alleles, a well-known genetic marker related to poor recovery following brain injury and sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer disease.  Since APOE4 is associated with impaired recovery from brain injury, but not with cognitive function in healthy children, an association of APOE4 with impaired cognitive development that we see with heavy diarrhea burdens in favela (shanty-town) children will strongly suggest that these children endure a form of ""brain injury"" with their heavy diarrheal illness burdens in their most formative first two years of life.  Hence, our longstanding collaboration and prospective field cohort surveillance will enable the use of new approaches and genetic technologies to define APOE allele distribution with impaired cognitive development, thus assessing the potential impact of early childhood diarrheal illnesses as a cause of ""brain injury"" at the critical formative first 2 years of life.  This project will also open new opportunities to train both US and international scientists in highly relevant bench and field investigation, holding promise for demonstrating a key intervention targeted at the most vulnerable subset of children in greatest need.

"Cross-Cultural Validity of Cognitive Function Tests DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The two largest racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S., African-Americans and Hispanics, are at higher risk for diabetes and certain diabetes complications than non-Hispanic whites. Recently, cognitive impairment and accelerated cognitive decline have been found to be higher in persons with type 2 diabetes than in nondiabetics. In population based studies these minority groups also appear to be greater risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. The relationship between race/ethnicity and cognitive impairment among persons with type 2 diabetes has not been studied. Before such studies can be undertaken, it is necessary to identify a set of cognitive function tests that is reliable and cross culturally valid in patient groups at greatest risk for type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a brief battery of culturally neutral cognitive function tests can yield reliable and valid measures of specific cognitive function domains in low literacy, bilingual, bi-cultural patient populations. The cognitive function tests included in the battery have been previously tested and normed in both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking groups, but their crosscultural validity is not known. A total of 480 patients with type 2 diabetes representing four ethnicity/language preference groups will be recruited from a large, urban, primary care clinic network (120 non-Hispanic whites, 120 non-Hispanic African-Americans, 120 Hispanics whose preferred language is English, and 120 Hispanics whose preferred language is Spanish). They will be tested at an initial time point and one month later. Patients will be compensated financially for their time so that at least 312 (65%) patients with complete test-retest data will be available for analysis. Sociodemographic and medical history data will be collected from the participants and their medical records. Height, weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference will be measured before the initial test session. In a 40% subsample (n=208), fasting plasma glucose and insulin, lipid profile, plasma homocysteine (with folate and vitamin B12), and c-reactive protein will be measured. The test-retest reliability of the individual tests in the battery will be calculated for each ethnic group, and the validity of the tests across the four defined racial/ethnic and linguistic groups will be tested using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. For those cognitive function measures found to be reliable and valid, multiple regression analysis will be used to test associations between test scores and specific clinical characteristics of the patients, such as age, duration of diabetes, glycemic level, diabetes treatment regimen, and each of the physical and biochemical variables will be examined.

"Outcomes and Predictors in Mild Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in aging-related patient-oriented research. The candidate is a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh with an established track record as a researcher, clinician, and educator. The proposed research is focused on Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a variably defined condition generally regarded as a prodromal and/or risk state for AIzheimer's and other dementias. Its basic premise is that current ""diagnostic"" criteria for MCI do not reflect the real-world distribution and outcomes in older adults in the typical community or clinical setting. In particular, MCI may be unstable and heterogeneous especially in patients with significant comorbidity and on multiple medications. The aims of the Research Plan are to refine the criteria and propose new ones developed from: (1) analysis of existing data on MCI from a completed 15-year longitudinal community-based study of an aging cohort, and (2) an added focus on MCI in an ongoing study of older primary care patients. The refined criteria will be applied to (3) a new multicenter cohort study, for which methods and criteria will be derived from the preceding two components and pilot data will be collected during the K24.   The Mentoring Plan is targeted towards beginning clinician investigators with excellent clinical and academic backgrounds and a commitment to clinical research in dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Trainees will obtain hands-on experience of patient-oriented research by conducting research assessments of patients participating in the ongoing primary care study (part 2 above), under supervision by the K24 awardee, and participating in the multidisciplinary consensus diagnosis conferences. They will also obtain supervised experience of analyzing, interpreting, and reporting data from the completed community study (part 1 above) for publication.

"APOE Genotype in Brazilian Children with Early Diarrhea DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Having defined the magnitude, major new etiologies, key novel mechanisms and short-term and long-term impact of persistent and recurring diarrheal illnesses on cognitive development in a model collaboration and cohort of children born into active prospective surveillance in poor urban areas (shanty-towns) in Northeast Brazil, we now have a unique opportunity to better assign causal relationships by establishing the importance of genetic markers in defining risk, plan prevention strategies for future interventions, and build sustainable human genetic research together with environmental assessment.  This proposal directly addresses potentially remediable mechanisms of long-term cognitive impairment, which we have calculated more than doubles the DALY impact of early childhood diarrheal illnesses worldwide.  We postulate, based on our previous cognitive outcome data, that the greatest long-term impact will occur in children with persistent and recurring diarrheal illnesses carrying APOE4 alleles, a well-known genetic marker related to poor recovery following brain injury and sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer disease.  Since APOE4 is associated with impaired recovery from brain injury, but not with cognitive function in healthy children, an association of APOE4 with impaired cognitive development that we see with heavy diarrhea burdens in favela (shanty-town) children will strongly suggest that these children endure a form of ""brain injury"" with their heavy diarrheal illness burdens in their most formative first two years of life.  Hence, our longstanding collaboration and prospective field cohort surveillance will enable the use of new approaches and genetic technologies to define APOE allele distribution with impaired cognitive development, thus assessing the potential impact of early childhood diarrheal illnesses as a cause of ""brain injury"" at the critical formative first 2 years of life.  This project will also open new opportunities to train both US and international scientists in highly relevant bench and field investigation, holding promise for demonstrating a key intervention targeted at the most vulnerable subset of children in greatest need.

"Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimers Disease DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The African American community has been under-represented in the search for etiologic factors for Alzheimer's disease CAD), despite data showing increased incidence in this ethnic population and evidence that African Americans may have a different constellation of risk factors than those identified in Caucasians. To elucidate genetic risk factors in this population, we propose a clinic-based case-control study of AD in Detroit, Michigan, using 500 cases and 600 controls. In contrast to previous studies limited by small sample sizes, we have a unique opportunity to collect a large African American case control series through our collaboration with the Henry Ford Health System, Health Alliance Plan (HAP), which insures over 500,000 members in southeastern Michigan. We will collect cases from the Neurology Clinic that is part of the Henry Ford Medical Group in Detroit, which sees over 250 new African American AD HAP members per year. The HAP database also provides a large pool of eligible African American controls residing in the same region and seeking care at the same HF clinics. We will focus our investigation on genes related to vascular mechanisms, considering the evidence for shared risk factors for vascular disease and AD; the evidence of common pathogenic pathways for AD and vascular disorders; and the observed overlap of cerebrovascular disease among AD patients upon imaging and at autopsy. This overlap is notably greater among African American patients, possibly leading to earlier clinical presentation and increased severity of disease.  Our specific aims are: (1) Collect and evaluate data for 500 cases / 600 controls from HAP, including vascular risk factors, serum protein levels, clinical vascular measurements, and white matter measurements from MRI (cases + subset of 200 controls); (2) Measure SNP and haplotype variation in 10 vascular candidate genes (6-10 SNPs per gene); (3) Compare candidate gene variation between cases and controls, between vascular strata within AD, and between AD cases and controls, stratified by vascular status; and (4) Explore the genetic influence on intermediate vascular factors within and among cases and controls. We will also genotype a set of 50 SNPs located throughout the genome to provide a 'stratification panel' to assess potential confounding due to admixture and to detect genetic outliers within cases or controls. This study, including a detailed analysis of white matter changes, assessment of vascular and other important AD risk factors, use of emerging SNP technologies and statistical methods, and development of new statistical methodology, will provide a more powerful and rigorous genetic approach than previous candidate gene case-control studies. Further, the imaging results will be of great interest clinically, as very few imaging projects of this kind have been carried out in an African American population.

"Cognitive Consensus in Cross-Cultural Competence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is submitted in response to PA-02-043 (""Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health"") to pursue research that moves beyond the simple description of health care disparities toward a scientific agenda that investigates the mechanisms and processes that help to explain these inequities. The research takes the innovative approach of examining tenets of ""cognitive consensus"" theory from the industrial/organizational literature on team functioning as they relate to clinical teamwork in mental health treatment for youth.  The project will select a sample of 260 African American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, Latino, and non-Hispanic White adolescent clients entering services in a real-world setting of school-based mental health services. Cognitive consensus on key cognitive model components in adolescent-parent-therapist sets will be assessed at treatment entry, and the relationship between cognitive consensus and longitudinal service use, adolescent client satisfaction, and treatment outcomes will be examined.   The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Describe how social, psychological, and contextual factors are associated with cognitive consensus; (2) Examine racial/ethnic differences in cognitive consensus; (3) Examine cognitive consensus as a predictor of service use, adolescent client satisfaction, and treatment outcomes. The proposed research is designed to identify factors evident in the initial clinical encounter that are associated with better treatment outcomes for an ethnically-diverse sample of youth.

"Cross-Cultural Validity of Cognitive Function Tests DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The two largest racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S., African-Americans and Hispanics, are at higher risk for diabetes and certain diabetes complications than non-Hispanic whites. Recently, cognitive impairment and accelerated cognitive decline have been found to be higher in persons with type 2 diabetes than in nondiabetics. In population based studies these minority groups also appear to be greater risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. The relationship between race/ethnicity and cognitive impairment among persons with type 2 diabetes has not been studied. Before such studies can be undertaken, it is necessary to identify a set of cognitive function tests that is reliable and cross culturally valid in patient groups at greatest risk for type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a brief battery of culturally neutral cognitive function tests can yield reliable and valid measures of specific cognitive function domains in low literacy, bilingual, bi-cultural patient populations. The cognitive function tests included in the battery have been previously tested and normed in both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking groups, but their crosscultural validity is not known. A total of 480 patients with type 2 diabetes representing four ethnicity/language preference groups will be recruited from a large, urban, primary care clinic network (120 non-Hispanic whites, 120 non-Hispanic African-Americans, 120 Hispanics whose preferred language is English, and 120 Hispanics whose preferred language is Spanish). They will be tested at an initial time point and one month later. Patients will be compensated financially for their time so that at least 312 (65%) patients with complete test-retest data will be available for analysis. Sociodemographic and medical history data will be collected from the participants and their medical records. Height, weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference will be measured before the initial test session. In a 40% subsample (n=208), fasting plasma glucose and insulin, lipid profile, plasma homocysteine (with folate and vitamin B12), and c-reactive protein will be measured. The test-retest reliability of the individual tests in the battery will be calculated for each ethnic group, and the validity of the tests across the four defined racial/ethnic and linguistic groups will be tested using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. For those cognitive function measures found to be reliable and valid, multiple regression analysis will be used to test associations between test scores and specific clinical characteristics of the patients, such as age, duration of diabetes, glycemic level, diabetes treatment regimen, and each of the physical and biochemical variables will be examined.

"Racial Disparities-Congitive Impairment/Health Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than five percent of the US population over 65 has cognitive impairment. This proportion will quadruple by 2050. During the same time period, the US minority population will double. Thus, understanding how cognitive impairment develops in minority elders is an increasingly important public health issue. This proposal will examine cognitive decline, defined as cognitive function changes over time. We will not only examine racial disparities in cognitive decline, but also examine how these disparities influence downstream health outcomes (i.e. functional decline, nursing home placement, and death). The aims of this proposal are:    1) To determine if there is a disparity in cognitive decline between older adults of minority and White race, and if so, to identify factors that explain this disparity 2) To determine and compare the impact of cognitive decline on poor health outcomes (functional decline, nursing home placement, and death) for older adults of minority and White race; and 3) To determine whether intervening health events (i.e. hospitalizations) mediate the association between cognitive decline and poor health outcomes. This proposal will use state-of the- art longitudinal modeling strategies coupled with advanced psychometrics to investigate these associations. This research will be conducted in three race/ethnic groups: African American (AA), Latino (L) and White (W) older adults. We will test our hypotheses in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (Health ABC) (n=3075, 6 years of follow up, 42% AA) and the Assets in Health Dynamics in the Oldest Old Study (AHEAD) (n=6566, 10 years of follow up, 13% AA, 5% L). Identifying the underlying causes of racial disparities in cognitive decline and poor health outcomes is important, because it will be the first step towards eliminating these disparities.   At the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Dr. Mehta has the support of a multidisciplinary team of mentors, who will guide her in linking her career development plan with her research aims. Her intense training plan includes didactic course work and structured tutorials on: 1) minority research 2) health outcomes research 3) the evaluation of cognitive decline, 4) state-of-the art statistical skills, and 5) general research skills.

"Dementia and Disability in Thai Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Dementia is becoming increasingly common in underdeveloped societies. Methods for detecting, diagnosing, and treating dementia appropriate for application in developing economies is critically important to avoid the emergence of health disparities in care of dementia patients. The Dementia and Disability in Thai Elderly Project (DDP) unites the expertise of the UCLA Alzheimer's Disease Center and the Neurodegenerative Disease and Behavioral Neurology Section of the Division of Neurology of Mahidol University to respond to a newly instituted public health mandate (the Rehabilitation and Disabled Persons Act, BE2534) requiring that each university or medical center take responsibility for the care of patients in their assigned catchment areas in Bangkok. This research will be done primarily in Thailand at Mahidol University in collaboration with Vorapun Senanarong, M.D. as an extension of NIH grant #P50 AG16570. The methodology proposed in the DDP has been accepted by the individual responsible for the Mahidol catchment area, Professor Udom Kachitorn, as the means of detecting and characterizing dementia and disability in Thai elderly. Two thousand-six hundred fifty Thai elderly live in the catchment area and will be screened over a 6-month period in temples, schools, and elderly clubs. We anticipate the identification of 130 individuals with dementia and 450 individuals with cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND). These patients will be assessed to determine the cause of the dementia and cognitive impairment. These patients plus 100 non-demented, non-disabled controls will be reassessed 1 year later. We hypothesize that the Thai Activities of Daily Living scale will detect disability in 40% of Thai elderly; dementia will be present in 5% of Thai elderly; Alzheimer's disease will account for 60% of the dementia detected in Thai elderly; CIND will be present in 17% of Thai elderly, the 1-year incidence of dementia will be present in those with CIND at baseline; patients with dementia at baseline will exhibit a cognitive decline of 4 Thai Mental Status Examination points per year; and disability will be highly correlated with cognitive deterioration. The phases of the study (training, screening, assessment, and follow-up) will be completed over a 3-year period. Our program is ambitious and substantial cost sharing will be undertaken by Mahidol University. The outcomes of this study are critically important for public health planning of the needs of disabled and cognitively impaired urban Thai elderly. The DDP will serve as a model for the implementation for disability and dementia screening in other catchment areas of Bangkok.

Our specific aims are: (1) Collect and evaluate data for 500 cases / 600 controls from HAP, including vascular risk factors, serum protein levels, clinical vascular measurements, and white matter measurements from MRI (cases + subset of 200 controls); (2) Measure SNP and haplotype variation in 10 vascular candidate genes (6-10 SNPs per gene); (3) Compare candidate gene variation between cases and controls, between vascular strata within AD, and between AD cases and controls, stratified by vascular status; and (4) Explore the genetic influence on intermediate vascular factors within and among cases and controls. We will also genotype a set of 50 SNPs located throughout the genome to provide a 'stratification panel' to assess potential confounding due to admixture and to detect genetic outliers within cases or controls. This study, including a detailed analysis of white matter changes, assessment of vascular and other important AD risk factors, use of emerging SNP technologies and statistical methods, and development of new statistical methodology, will provide a more powerful and rigorous genetic approach than previous candidate gene case-control studies. Further, the imaging results will be of great interest clinically, as very few imaging projects of this kind have been carried out in an African American population.

"Population-Based Study of MCI Heterogeneity in African American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a postdoctoral fellow at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville with diverse training and research experience in neuropsychology. The candidate's career goal is to become an independent investigator in the area of cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, with a particular focus on minority populations. The proposed multidisciplinary training program will provide the candidate with a mentored research experience in MCI and dementia within the framework of the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and structured didactic training in epidemiology and longitudinal research methods. The proposed study endeavors to address a critical gap in our current understanding of the transition between normal aging and early dementia. African Americans demonstrate elevated rates of numerous biomedical and psychosocial risk factors for dementia, and thus constitute a particularly vulnerable demographic group for disease onset. Indeed, epidemiological evidence suggests that the incidence, prevalence, and lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among African American elders may be twice that of Caucasians. Therefore, the characterization of MCI within this demographic group is of paramount importance. Recent consensus has highlighted the heterogeneous nature of MCI, and it is now clear that at least three clinical subtypes may represent distinct diagnostic and etiological entities (i.e., amnestic MCI; multiple domain MCI with or without memory impairment; single domain MCI). The proposed study is a population-based, cross-sectional investigation of the relationship between health, genetic, and psychosocial factors, and MCI heterogeneity in African Americans aged 65 and older. Specifically, the proposed study aims to: 1) estimate the proportion of MCI clinical subtypes in African Americans aged 65 and older, and 2) investigate the independent and multivariate relationship between health, genetic, and psychosocial factors and MCI subtypes in this demographic group. The geographic target area for this study will consist of 15 contiguous census tracts in Duval County (Jacksonville, Florida), in which at least 80% of individuals of age 65 and older are African American. Ultimately, the proposed research program will address a major public health disparity concern, namely, the increased incidence of AD in the African American population and its prevention via the early and reliable identification of individuals with MCI.

"Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Partial support is requested to host a research conference on the ""Epidemiology of Alzheimer's Disease"" to be held on April 27-28, 2006 in San Diego, CA. In April 1976, Robert Katzman published a seminal editorial ""The Prevalence and Malignancy of Alzheimer Disease: A Major Killer"" in the Archives of Neurology. 30 years later, we feel it is timely to review progress, challenges, and future opportunities in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) epidemiology by holding a conference. The major goals are to 1) review scientific progress in the field; 2) provide a forum to discuss hot topics in epidemiology including: minority populations/risk factors and education/literacy and brain reserve; 3) facilitate interaction and collaboration between junior researchers and leaders in the field; and 4) reach a population of minority healthcare providers who might not otherwise have access to this information. Conference sessions will be organized by types of epidemiological studies: Descriptive studies will include prevalence and incidence studies of both mild cognitive impairment and AD in different ethnic groups both in the US and worldwide. Analytical studies will describe both risk and protective factors, including genetic, cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors, diet, medications, and cognitive stimulation. Experimental studies will review current and completed prevention clinical trials. Special presentations will provide a historical perspective on the epidemiology of AD, a discussion of the urgency to prevent AD due to numbers and cost and a discussion of lessons we have learned from pathology. Moderated panels will discuss our hot topics to encourage meaningful interactions among speakers and the audience. Outreach to targeted racial and ethnic healthcare providers may improve health disparities in groups with high representation of putative risk factors. Researchers attending the conference will obtain a critical review, update, and information about controversial questions as well as research opportunities. This small conference will facilitate exchange of ideas and concepts. Partial support is requested to defray travel costs of invited speakers and to provide travel awards to minority healthcare providers, junior faculty, postdocs and students.          ",Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Conference,7114556,R13AG028253,"[""Alzheimer's disease "", ' meeting /conference /symposium ', ' nervous system disorder epidemiology ', ' travel ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R13,2006,20000,0.03079801175457168
"Racial Disparities-Congitive Impairment/Health Outcomespa00-019    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than five percent of the US population over 65 has cognitive impairment. This proportion will quadruple by 2050. During the same time period, the US minority population will double. Thus, understanding how cognitive impairment develops in minority elders is an increasingly important public health issue. This proposal will examine cognitive decline, defined as cognitive function changes over time. We will not only examine racial disparities in cognitive decline, but also examine how these disparities influence downstream health outcomes (i.e. functional decline, nursing home placement, and death). The aims of this proposal are:    1) To determine if there is a disparity in cognitive decline between older adults of minority and White race, and if so, to identify factors that explain this disparity 2) To determine and compare the impact of cognitive decline on poor health outcomes (functional decline, nursing home placement, and death) for older adults of minority and White race; and 3) To determine whether intervening health events (i.e. hospitalizations) mediate the association between cognitive decline and poor health outcomes. This proposal will use state-of the- art longitudinal modeling strategies coupled with advanced psychometrics to investigate these associations. This research will be conducted in three race/ethnic groups: African American (AA), Latino (L) and White (W) older adults. We will test our hypotheses in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (Health ABC) (n=3075, 6 years of follow up, 42% AA) and the Assets in Health Dynamics in the Oldest Old Study (AHEAD) (n=6566, 10 years of follow up, 13% AA, 5% L). Identifying the underlying causes of racial disparities in cognitive decline and poor health outcomes is important, because it will be the first step towards eliminating these disparities.   At the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Dr. Mehta has the support of a multidisciplinary team of mentors, who will guide her in linking her career development plan with her research aims. Her intense training plan includes didactic course work and structured tutorials on: 1) minority research 2) health outcomes research 3) the evaluation of cognitive decline, 4) state-of-the art statistical skills, and 5) general research skills. In sum, this five-year plan couples a focused set of hypotheses with an intense training plan built to launch a successful career as an independent investigator.         ",Racial Disparities-Congitive Impairment/Health Outcomespa00-019,7102619,K01AG025444,"['human old age (65+) ', ' dementia ', ' public health ', ' residential care facility ', ' hospital utilization ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human mortality ', ' health behavior ', ' cognition disorder ', ' social psychology ', ' psychometrics ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' functional ability ', ' human data ', ' comorbidity ', ' apolipoprotein E ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2006,115938,0.040116462945883044
"Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study which indicated an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women treated with hormone therapy (HT) led to a reevaluation of the benefits versus harm of hormone interventions. As part of this reevaluation, disparities between the beneficial outcomes of estrogen (E2, ET) and progesterone (P4) found in basic science analyses and the adverse outcomes of clinical trials were clear as were the disparities between the generally positive outcomes of ET and HT in observational studies versus the deleterious outcomes of clinical trials. The Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Program Project is designed to address key elements hypothesized to underlie these disparities as well as addressing the paucity of knowledge regarding the neurobiology of progesterone (P4) action in brain regions required for cognition and vulnerable to age associated degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's.              The over arching hypothesis of our program is that the ovarian steroid hormone progesterone promotes the brain's molecular, synaptic, cellular, and behavioral plasticity and reduces its vulnerability to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we hypothesize that progesterone has direct effects via activation of progesterone receptors in hippocampus and indirect effects via interaction with estrogen pathways. We further hypothesize that the reproductive endocrine status, duration of ovariprivation and presence of AD related pathology regulates the plasticity response to ovarian steroids.       We have designed the Program Project to investigate P4 action at 7 levels of function from molecular to behavioral to exacerbation of AD-like pathology in vivo. Embedded in each proposal is an assessment of: (1) P4 receptor expression; (2) direct effect of P4 on neural plasticity; (3) clinically relevant progestins for their comparability to P4; (3) change in response to E2 and P4 with reproductive endocrine status, age or duration of ovariprivation and (4) E2 and P4 regulation of neural plasticity or inflammatory responses in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.        Our long-term goals are three fold: (1) To establish a foundation of P4 neurobiology in brain regions required for cognitive function and vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease. (2) To develop rodent models of human perimenopause and menopause for both our investigations and those within the field of women's health.

"Columbia Center for Active Life of Minority Elders  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Columbia Center for the Active Live Expectancy (CALME) is the RCMAR at our site.  The goal of the CALME is to foster the expansion of minority aging research, the mentoring of minority investigators, and the dissemination of research information, with the objective of reducing health status differentials between minority and non-minority elders.  In order to achieve this goal, this competing continuation application proposes to establish six cores: Core I - Administrative; Core II - Community Liaison; Core III - Investigator Development; Core IV - Measurement; Core V - Methods and Data; Core VI- Coordinating Center.  The CALME is located in northern Manhattan in New York City, areas of high minority population density and wide health disparities.  This proposal involves continued collaboration with experienced researchers at the Columbia University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, with investigators leading other NIH-supported community-oriented research programs at Columbia University, and with researchers at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, NY.  These community oriented research programs include studies directed at Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia, stroke, cardiovascular disease, colorectal and breast cancer, and the use of home telemedicine to manage diabetes in older patients.   During the first five years of funding, the CALME functioned effectively to provide oversight, internal coordination, and interaction with outside agencies and organizations (Core I); to disseminate health and research information, to interact with community-based organizations, and to promote participation in community-oriented research (Core II); to identify and mentor 18 pilot grant awardees (20 separate awards) leading to a large number of publications and presentations as well as three awardees who now have independent federal grant support (Core III); to provide expertise in measurement of geriatric health outcomes (Core IV); and to give assistance in design, statistical methods, and data analysis (Core V).  This continuation proposal seeks to continue and expand these activities, to increase the CALME's collaborative activities beyond Columbia University, and to contribute to the national effort to reduce health disparities in the elderly.

"Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimers Disease DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The African American community has been under-represented in the search for etiologic factors for Alzheimer's disease CAD), despite data showing increased incidence in this ethnic population and evidence that African Americans may have a different constellation of risk factors than those identified in Caucasians. To elucidate genetic risk factors in this population, we propose a clinic-based case-control study of AD in Detroit, Michigan, using 500 cases and 600 controls. In contrast to previous studies limited by small sample sizes, we have a unique opportunity to collect a large African American case control series through our collaboration with the Henry Ford Health System, Health Alliance Plan (HAP), which insures over 500,000 members in southeastern Michigan. We will collect cases from the Neurology Clinic that is part of the Henry Ford Medical Group in Detroit, which sees over 250 new African American AD HAP members per year. The HAP database also provides a large pool of eligible African American controls residing in the same region and seeking care at the same HF clinics. We will focus our investigation on genes related to vascular mechanisms, considering the evidence for shared risk factors for vascular disease and AD; the evidence of common pathogenic pathways for AD and vascular disorders; and the observed overlap of cerebrovascular disease among AD patients upon imaging and at autopsy. This overlap is notably greater among African American patients, possibly leading to earlier clinical presentation and increased severity of disease.

"Outcomes and Predictors in Mild Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in aging-related patient-oriented research. The candidate is a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh with an established track record as a researcher, clinician, and educator. The proposed research is focused on Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a variably defined condition generally regarded as a prodromal and/or risk state for AIzheimer's and other dementias. Its basic premise is that current ""diagnostic"" criteria for MCI do not reflect the real-world distribution and outcomes in older adults in the typical community or clinical setting. In particular, MCI may be unstable and heterogeneous especially in patients with significant comorbidity and on multiple medications. The aims of the Research Plan are to refine the criteria and propose new ones developed from: (1) analysis of existing data on MCI from a completed 15-year longitudinal community-based study of an aging cohort, and (2) an added focus on MCI in an ongoing study of older primary care patients. The refined criteria will be applied to (3) a new multicenter cohort study, for which methods and criteria will be derived from the preceding two components and pilot data will be collected during the K24.   The Mentoring Plan is targeted towards beginning clinician investigators with excellent clinical and academic backgrounds and a commitment to clinical research in dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Trainees will obtain hands-on experience of patient-oriented research by conducting research assessments of patients participating in the ongoing primary care study (part 2 above), under supervision by the K24 awardee, and participating in the multidisciplinary consensus diagnosis conferences. They will also obtain supervised experience of analyzing, interpreting, and reporting data from the completed community study (part 1 above) for publication. A range of additional didactic and experiential programs is available depending on their interests and previous background. Each trainee will develop an independent research project application as part of the training and be evaluated on acquired knowledge, skills, and productivity.

"Cognitive Consensus in Cross-Cultural Competence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is submitted in response to PA-02-043 (""Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health"") to pursue research that moves beyond the simple description of health care disparities toward a scientific agenda that investigates the mechanisms and processes that help to explain these inequities. The research takes the innovative approach of examining tenets of ""cognitive consensus"" theory from the industrial/organizational literature on team functioning as they relate to clinical teamwork in mental health treatment for youth.  The project will select a sample of 260 African American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, Latino, and non-Hispanic White adolescent clients entering services in a real-world setting of school-based mental health services. Cognitive consensus on key cognitive model components in adolescent-parent-therapist sets will be assessed at treatment entry, and the relationship between cognitive consensus and longitudinal service use, adolescent client satisfaction, and treatment outcomes will be examined.   The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Describe how social, psychological, and contextual factors are associated with cognitive consensus; (2) Examine racial/ethnic differences in cognitive consensus; (3) Examine cognitive consensus as a predictor of service use, adolescent client satisfaction, and treatment outcomes. The proposed research is designed to identify factors evident in the initial clinical encounter that are associated with better treatment outcomes for an ethnically-diverse sample of youth.

This research will be conducted in three race/ethnic groups: African American (AA), Latino (L) and White (W) older adults. We will test our hypotheses in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (Health ABC) (n=3075, 6 years of follow up, 42% AA) and the Assets in Health Dynamics in the Oldest Old Study (AHEAD) (n=6566, 10 years of follow up, 13% AA, 5% L). Identifying the underlying causes of racial disparities in cognitive decline and poor health outcomes is important, because it will be the first step towards eliminating these disparities.   At the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Dr. Mehta has the support of a multidisciplinary team of mentors, who will guide her in linking her career development plan with her research aims.

"Detection of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease by fMRI Alzh¿imer's disease (AD) is preceded by a period when detectable changes in brain function occur without warning symptoms. This period may be twenty years or longer. Activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging is reduced during confi_ntation naming in normal women who have increased risk of late-onset Alzbeimer's disease, at an average age of only 53 years. These same individuals have reduced activation in the posterior cingulat¿ cortex during a memorization task, among other disparities. Our hypothesis is that the altered functional MRI responses in naming, working memory and memorization will quantifiably worsen with age, due to progressive underlying Alzheimcr's disease pathology. Disease-modifying treatments applied in this early, pre-symptomatic stage of AD could have profound impact, by preventing the onset of cognitive symptoms. Millions are currently being spent on large-scale prevention trials, with AD symptoms as end-points. By providing a biomarker ofpre-symptomatic AD progression, fMRI could potentially reduce the duration and costs of such trials. This continuation proposal is designed to detect changes in brain function in high-AD risk individuals over time. We will study normal education-matched groups of high- and low-AD risk subjects in the age ranges 40-65 and 65-90 years, using fMRI stimulus tasks which have previously demonstrated regional disparities in high-AD risk individuals. In addition, we will repeat the naming and fluency fMRI studies performed previously in high- and low-AD risk individuals after an interval of five years, in order to detect longitudinal changes in activation. The convergence of evidence from these cross-sectional and longitudinal studies could provide powerful evidence for a model of Alzheimer's disease as a relentless, slowly progressive brain pathology that begins early in adult life, but remains compensated until it produces clinical symptoms in its late stages.

"Racial Disparities-Congitive Impairment/Health Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than five percent of the US population over 65 has cognitive impairment. This proportion will quadruple by 2050. During the same time period, the US minority population will double. Thus, understanding how cognitive impairment develops in minority elders is an increasingly important public health issue. This proposal will examine cognitive decline, defined as cognitive function changes over time.

"Population-Based Study of MCI Heterogeneity in African American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a postdoctoral fellow at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville with diverse training and research experience in neuropsychology. The candidate's career goal is to become an independent investigator in the area of cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, with a particular focus on minority populations. The proposed multidisciplinary training program will provide the candidate with a mentored research experience in MCI and dementia within the framework of the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and structured didactic training in epidemiology and longitudinal research methods. The proposed study endeavors to address a critical gap in our current understanding of the transition between normal aging and early dementia. African Americans demonstrate elevated rates of numerous biomedical and psychosocial risk factors for dementia, and thus constitute a particularly vulnerable demographic group for disease onset. Indeed, epidemiological evidence suggests that the incidence, prevalence, and lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among African American elders may be twice that of Caucasians. Therefore, the characterization of MCI within this demographic group is of paramount importance. Recent consensus has highlighted the heterogeneous nature of MCI, and it is now clear that at least three clinical subtypes may represent distinct diagnostic and etiological entities (i.e., amnestic MCI; multiple domain MCI with or without memory impairment; single domain MCI). The proposed study is a population-based, cross-sectional investigation of the relationship between health, genetic, and psychosocial factors, and MCI heterogeneity in African Americans aged 65 and older. Specifically, the proposed study aims to: 1) estimate the proportion of MCI clinical subtypes in African Americans aged 65 and older, and 2) investigate the independent and multivariate relationship between health, genetic, and psychosocial factors and MCI subtypes in this demographic group. The geographic target area for this study will consist of 15 contiguous census tracts in Duval County (Jacksonville, Florida), in which at least 80% of individuals of age 65 and older are African American. Ultimately, the proposed research program will address a major public health disparity concern, namely, the increased incidence of AD in the African American population and its prevention via the early and reliable identification of individuals with MCI.

"Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study which indicated an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women treated with hormone therapy (HT) led to a reevaluation of the benefits versus harm of hormone interventions. As part of this reevaluation, disparities between the beneficial outcomes of estrogen (E2, ET) and progesterone (P4) found in basic science analyses and the adverse outcomes of clinical trials were clear as were the disparities between the generally positive outcomes of ET and HT in observational studies versus the deleterious outcomes of clinical trials. The Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Program Project is designed to address key elements hypothesized to underlie these disparities as well as addressing the paucity of knowledge regarding the neurobiology of progesterone (P4) action in brain regions required for cognition and vulnerable to age associated degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's.              The over arching hypothesis of our program is that the ovarian steroid hormone progesterone promotes the brain's molecular, synaptic, cellular, and behavioral plasticity and reduces its vulnerability to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we hypothesize that progesterone has direct effects via activation of progesterone receptors in hippocampus and indirect effects via interaction with estrogen pathways. We further hypothesize that the reproductive endocrine status, duration of ovariprivation and presence of AD related pathology regulates the plasticity response to ovarian steroids.       We have designed the Program Project to investigate P4 action at 7 levels of function from molecular to behavioral to exacerbation of AD-like pathology in vivo. Embedded in each proposal is an assessment of: (1) P4 receptor expression; (2) direct effect of P4 on neural plasticity; (3) clinically relevant progestins for their comparability to P4; (3) change in response to E2 and P4 with reproductive endocrine status, age or duration of ovariprivation and (4) E2 and P4 regulation of neural plasticity or inflammatory responses in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.        Our long-term goals are three fold: (1) To establish a foundation of P4 neurobiology in brain regions required for cognitive function and vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease. (2) To develop rodent models of human perimenopause and menopause for both our investigations and those within the field of women's health. (3) To provide insights into the basis of disparities between basic science outcomes and clinical trial outcomes as well as the disparities between observational studies and clinical trials of HT and AD.           ",Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease,7447873,P01AG026572,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P01,2008,1562564,0.13385280959265414
"Cognitive Consensus in Cross-Cultural Competence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is submitted in response to PA-02-043 (""Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health"") to pursue research that moves beyond the simple description of health care disparities toward a scientific agenda that investigates the mechanisms and processes that help to explain these inequities. The research takes the innovative approach of examining tenets of ""cognitive consensus"" theory from the industrial/organizational literature on team functioning as they relate to clinical teamwork in mental health treatment for youth.  The project will select a sample of 260 African American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, Latino, and non-Hispanic White adolescent clients entering services in a real-world setting of school-based mental health services. Cognitive consensus on key cognitive model components in adolescent-parent-therapist sets will be assessed at treatment entry, and the relationship between cognitive consensus and longitudinal service use, adolescent client satisfaction, and treatment outcomes will be examined.   The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Describe how social, psychological, and contextual factors are associated with cognitive consensus; (2) Examine racial/ethnic differences in cognitive consensus; (3) Examine cognitive consensus as a predictor of service use, adolescent client satisfaction, and treatment outcomes. The proposed research is designed to identify factors evident in the initial clinical encounter that are associated with better treatment outcomes for an ethnically-diverse sample of youth.

"HANDLS Scan Substudy: Race, Socioeconomic status, and the Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pronounced health disparities associated with race and socioeconomic status (SES) are noted for brain health endpoints including stroke (particularly at younger ages), dementia, brain structure on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive decline, and functional disability. Efforts are needed to disentangle respective influences of race and SES on brain health, particularly early and subtle markers of pathology predictive of future stroke and dementia. MRI- assessed measures of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume and diffusion tensor imaging measures of WM microstructure offer such proven associations. Also critical is identification of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to subtle brain pathology. Biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social and environmental factors have been implicated as potential mediators of the relations of race and SES to many physical health outcomes, but exceedingly little is known about these pathways with respect to brain health. MRI indices of subtle brain pathology may also mediate relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Here we propose an interdisciplinary, ancillary study to the Healthy Aging In Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS). HANDLS study is a new 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the National Institute on Aging's Intramural Research Program focused on understanding health disparities among 4,000 socioeconomically diverse African-Americans (AA) and Whites living in Baltimore, MD. HANDLS is uniquely designed to disentangle the respective relations of race and SES to health outcomes. In HANDLS SCAN we propose to obtain quantitative MRI data from 500 (250 AA, 250 White; ages 30-64) stroke- and dementia-free HANDLS participants with a full range of SES to: (1) Examine race- and SES-related disparities in GM and WM volume, and WM microstructure (2) Examine multi-level mediators - biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental - of the relations of race and SES to GM and WM; and (3) Examine whether GM and WM are proximal mediators of the relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Structural equation modeling will be used to construct increasingly complex models to address these interrelated aims. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An understanding of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to early and subtle markers of brain pathology, and the relation of brain pathology to cognitive and physical function, is needed to facilitate appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Relevance An understanding of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to early and subtle markers of brain pathology,

"Racial Disparities-Congitive Impairment/Health Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than five percent of the US population over 65 has cognitive impairment. This proportion will quadruple by 2050. During the same time period, the US minority population will double. Thus, understanding how cognitive impairment develops in minority elders is an increasingly important public health issue. This proposal will examine cognitive decline, defined as cognitive function changes over time. We will not only examine racial disparities in cognitive decline, but also examine how these disparities influence downstream health outcomes (i.e. functional decline, nursing home placement, and death). The aims of this proposal are:    1) To determine if there is a disparity in cognitive decline between older adults of minority and White race, and if so, to identify factors that explain this disparity 2) To determine and compare the impact of cognitive decline on poor health outcomes (functional decline, nursing home placement, and death) for older adults of minority and White race; and 3) To determine whether intervening health events (i.e. hospitalizations) mediate the association between cognitive decline and poor health outcomes. This proposal will use state-of the- art longitudinal modeling strategies coupled with advanced psychometrics to investigate these associations. This research will be conducted in three race/ethnic groups: African American (AA), Latino (L) and White (W) older adults. We will test our hypotheses in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study (Health ABC) (n=3075, 6 years of follow up, 42% AA) and the Assets in Health Dynamics in the Oldest Old Study (AHEAD) (n=6566, 10 years of follow up, 13% AA, 5% L). Identifying the underlying causes of racial disparities in cognitive decline and poor health outcomes is important, because it will be the first step towards eliminating these disparities.   At the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Dr. Mehta has the support of a multidisciplinary team of mentors, who will guide her in linking her career development plan with her research aims. Her intense training plan includes didactic course work and structured tutorials on: 1) minority research 2) health outcomes research 3) the evaluation of cognitive decline, 4) state-of-the art statistical skills, and 5) general research skills. In sum, this five-year plan couples a focused set of hypotheses with an intense training plan built to launch a successful career as an independent investigator.         ",Racial Disparities-Congitive Impairment/Health Outcomes,7647895,K01AG025444,"['Couples ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Aging ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Length ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Sum ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Five-Year Plans ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Psychometrics ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' ApoE ', ' Apo-E ', ' APOE [{C0003595}] ', ' San Francisco ', ' Consensus ', ' Arts ', ' cognitive function ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Accounting ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' Minority ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild neurocognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' minority subjects ', ' standard measure ', ' psychosocial ', ' Body Composition ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2009,116370,0.040116462945883044
"New Approaches to Dementia Heterogeneity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The new Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has made remarkable progress in just four years, developing new diagnostic approaches to dementia, supporting exciting translational and basic science research and providing training and education at a local and national level. We remain committed to four overarching aims: 1) to explore heterogeneous presentations of dementia in the early stages; 2) to train new basic and translational science leaders in dementia; 3) to educate regarding the non-AD dementias and atypical presentations of AD using conferences and novel web-based approaches; and 4) to bridge the gap between clinical and laboratory studies in dementia by supporting new treatment efforts for AD, FTLD and CJD. With renewal, we will develop better ways to diagnose patients with early FTLD, CBD, PSP, CJD and atypical AD. We will catalyze the development of rational therapies for FTLD with ubiquitin-TDP-43 inclusions, FTLD with tau inclusions, and FTLD associated with progranulin mutations. To generate successful new therapies, we will create effective animal models of disease (Farese project 3) and enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis using our Clinical Core and novel imaging approaches (Seeley project 1). We will involve investigators at the Gladstone Institute such as Lennart Mucke (project 2), Yadong Huang, Li Can, and Robert Mahley in the evaluation of ADRC tissue to bring laboratory findings to the clinic. We will also interact with the CJD drug development program in the Prusiner and DeArmond laboratories by providing well-characterized patients and biosamples. By developing an internet-based approach to education, we will reach tens of thousands of people every year, educating them about dementia, its symptoms, causes and available treatments. We will also host novel and exciting conferences and retreats that generate enthusiasm for our field. To spearhead dementia research, we will continue to attract, train and nurture future leaders in neurodegenerative disease, both in clinical and basic science research. To address the inequalities among aging minority populations, we will develop a unique cohort of Chinese-American patients and integrate this community into our treatment efforts. To understand why some people are able to stave off dementia, we will develop a large healthy aging cohort that will participate in new preventative research efforts. Finally, we will create ideal data management approaches for neurodegenerative conditions that will be shared with other ADRCs, beginning with UC-Davis.   RELEVANCE: The UCSF ADRC enables multidisciplinary investigations of the clinical, imaging, molecular, and pathological features of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and related disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ""healthy aging,"" and promotes the development of novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.          ",New Approaches to Dementia Heterogeneity,7622199,P50AG023501,[''],NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P50,2009,1736875,0.15119808883680796
"Population-Based Study of MCI Heterogeneity in African American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a postdoctoral fellow at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville with diverse training and research experience in neuropsychology. The candidate's career goal is to become an independent investigator in the area of cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, with a particular focus on minority populations. The proposed multidisciplinary training program will provide the candidate with a mentored research experience in MCI and dementia within the framework of the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and structured didactic training in epidemiology and longitudinal research methods. The proposed study endeavors to address a critical gap in our current understanding of the transition between normal aging and early dementia. African Americans demonstrate elevated rates of numerous biomedical and psychosocial risk factors for dementia, and thus constitute a particularly vulnerable demographic group for disease onset. Indeed, epidemiological evidence suggests that the incidence, prevalence, and lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among African American elders may be twice that of Caucasians. Therefore, the characterization of MCI within this demographic group is of paramount importance. Recent consensus has highlighted the heterogeneous nature of MCI, and it is now clear that at least three clinical subtypes may represent distinct diagnostic and etiological entities (i.e., amnestic MCI; multiple domain MCI with or without memory impairment; single domain MCI). The proposed study is a population-based, cross-sectional investigation of the relationship between health, genetic, and psychosocial factors, and MCI heterogeneity in African Americans aged 65 and older. Specifically, the proposed study aims to: 1) estimate the proportion of MCI clinical subtypes in African Americans aged 65 and older, and 2) investigate the independent and multivariate relationship between health, genetic, and psychosocial factors and MCI subtypes in this demographic group. The geographic target area for this study will consist of 15 contiguous census tracts in Duval County (Jacksonville, Florida), in which at least 80% of individuals of age 65 and older are African American. Ultimately, the proposed research program will address a major public health disparity concern, namely, the increased incidence of AD in the African American population and its prevention via the early and reliable identification of individuals with MCI.

"Cognitive Consensus in Cross-Cultural Competence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is submitted in response to PA-02-043 (""Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health"") to pursue research that moves beyond the simple description of health care disparities toward a scientific agenda that investigates the mechanisms and processes that help to explain these inequities. The research takes the innovative approach of examining tenets of ""cognitive consensus"" theory from the industrial/organizational literature on team functioning as they relate to clinical teamwork in mental health treatment for youth.  The project will select a sample of 260 African American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, Latino, and non-Hispanic White adolescent clients entering services in a real-world setting of school-based mental health services. Cognitive consensus on key cognitive model components in adolescent-parent-therapist sets will be assessed at treatment entry, and the relationship between cognitive consensus and longitudinal service use, adolescent client satisfaction, and treatment outcomes will be examined.   The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Describe how social, psychological, and contextual factors are associated with cognitive consensus; (2) Examine racial/ethnic differences in cognitive consensus; (3) Examine cognitive consensus as a predictor of service use, adolescent client satisfaction, and treatment outcomes. The proposed research is designed to identify factors evident in the initial clinical encounter that are associated with better treatment outcomes for an ethnically-diverse sample of youth. The ultimate goal of the proposed project is to increase the effectiveness of care by identifying specific culture-linked cognitive processes that can be targeted in future intervention development.

"Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study which indicated an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women treated with hormone therapy (HT) led to a reevaluation of the benefits versus harm of hormone interventions. As part of this reevaluation, disparities between the beneficial outcomes of estrogen (E2, ET) and progesterone (P4) found in basic science analyses and the adverse outcomes of clinical trials were clear as were the disparities between the generally positive outcomes of ET and HT in observational studies versus the deleterious outcomes of clinical trials. The Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Program Project is designed to address key elements hypothesized to underlie these disparities as well as addressing the paucity of knowledge regarding the neurobiology of progesterone (P4) action in brain regions required for cognition and vulnerable to age associated degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's.              The over arching hypothesis of our program is that the ovarian steroid hormone progesterone promotes the brain's molecular, synaptic, cellular, and behavioral plasticity and reduces its vulnerability to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we hypothesize that progesterone has direct effects via activation of progesterone receptors in hippocampus and indirect effects via interaction with estrogen pathways. We further hypothesize that the reproductive endocrine status, duration of ovariprivation and presence of AD related pathology regulates the plasticity response to ovarian steroids.       We have designed the Program Project to investigate P4 action at 7 levels of function from molecular to behavioral to exacerbation of AD-like pathology in vivo. Embedded in each proposal is an assessment of: (1) P4 receptor expression; (2) direct effect of P4 on neural plasticity; (3) clinically relevant progestins for their comparability to P4; (3) change in response to E2 and P4 with reproductive endocrine status, age or duration of ovariprivation and (4) E2 and P4 regulation of neural plasticity or inflammatory responses in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.        Our long-term goals are three fold: (1) To establish a foundation of P4 neurobiology in brain regions required for cognitive function and vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease. (2) To develop rodent models of human perimenopause and menopause for both our investigations and those within the field of women's health. (3) To provide insights into the basis of disparities between basic science outcomes and clinical trial outcomes as well as the disparities between observational studies and clinical trials of HT and AD.           ",Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease,7626297,P01AG026572,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P01,2009,1602136,0.13385280959265414
"Poverty, Low Birth Weight and Early Cognitive Delay: A Population-Based Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children who are cognitively delayed are very likely to experience a range of negative educational and societal outcomes. Thus, it is important to accurately identify those factors that elevate a child's risk for cognitive delay. Yet cognitive delay's etiology is both complex and poorly understood. Few studies have used measures of the wide range of hypothesized risk factors (e.g., poverty, low birthweight, poor child health) and samples that allow for unbiased population sub-group (e.g., African Americans, Latinos, Asians) estimates. No study to date has investigated cognitive delay by repeatedly assessing the cognitive abilities of children over their first five years. This project explores the disorder's etiology using a new, nationally representative dataset, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). The project has two specific aims: 1) To use an unusually large, nationally representative sample of low birthweight and non-low-birthweight children, with multiple data collection points at very young ages, to examine developmental patterns of cognitive delay at 9, 24, 48, and 60 months of age, and how these are related to poverty, low birthweight, and their correlates, including single parenthood and racial/ethnic minority status; and 2) To test three types of post-birth risk factors as potential explanations for the relationships between (a) poverty, low birthweight, and their correlates, and (b) cognitive disability at 9, 24, 48, and 60 months. These additional risk factors are poor child health, inadequate parenting, and low quality childcare. The project will address these aims by fitting generalized linear mixed models to ECLS-B data for children at 9, 24, 48, and 60 months of age. In these models, child physical health, parenting quality, and caregiving will appear as time-varying covariates. By providing accurate estimates of the factors that elevate a child's risk for cognitive delay, the project will help identify promising avenues for early intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young children with cognitive delays are at high risk for a range of negative long-term health and social outcomes. This project will capitalize on the availability of a new, nationally representative dataset to illuminate the multiple pathways that lead to cognitive delay during young childhood, and identify promising avenues for early intervention.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young children with cognitive delays are at high risk for a range of negative long-term health and social outcomes.

"HANDLS Scan Substudy: Race, Socioeconomic status, and the Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pronounced health disparities associated with race and socioeconomic status (SES) are noted for brain health endpoints including stroke (particularly at younger ages), dementia, brain structure on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive decline, and functional disability. Efforts are needed to disentangle respective influences of race and SES on brain health, particularly early and subtle markers of pathology predictive of future stroke and dementia. MRI- assessed measures of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume and diffusion tensor imaging measures of WM microstructure offer such proven associations. Also critical is identification of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to subtle brain pathology. Biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social and environmental factors have been implicated as potential mediators of the relations of race and SES to many physical health outcomes, but exceedingly little is known about these pathways with respect to brain health. MRI indices of subtle brain pathology may also mediate relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Here we propose an interdisciplinary, ancillary study to the Healthy Aging In Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS). HANDLS study is a new 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the National Institute on Aging's Intramural Research Program focused on understanding health disparities among 4,000 socioeconomically diverse African-Americans (AA) and Whites living in Baltimore, MD. HANDLS is uniquely designed to disentangle the respective relations of race and SES to health outcomes. In HANDLS SCAN we propose to obtain quantitative MRI data from 500 (250 AA, 250 White; ages 30-64) stroke- and dementia-free HANDLS participants with a full range of SES to: (1) Examine race- and SES-related disparities in GM and WM volume, and WM microstructure (2) Examine multi-level mediators - biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental - of the relations of race and SES to GM and WM; and (3) Examine whether GM and WM are proximal mediators of the relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Structural equation modeling will be used to construct increasingly complex models to address these interrelated aims. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An understanding of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to early and subtle markers of brain pathology, and the relation of brain pathology to cognitive and physical function, is needed to facilitate appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Relevance An understanding of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to early and subtle markers of brain pathology,

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.              ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification.

"Poverty, Low Birth Weight and Early Cognitive Delay: A Population-Based Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children who are cognitively delayed are very likely to experience a range of negative educational and societal outcomes. Thus, it is important to accurately identify those factors that elevate a child's risk for cognitive delay. Yet cognitive delay's etiology is both complex and poorly understood. Few studies have used measures of the wide range of hypothesized risk factors (e.g., poverty, low birthweight, poor child health) and samples that allow for unbiased population sub-group (e.g., African Americans, Latinos, Asians) estimates. No study to date has investigated cognitive delay by repeatedly assessing the cognitive abilities of children over their first five years. This project explores the disorder's etiology using a new, nationally representative dataset, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). The project has two specific aims: 1) To use an unusually large, nationally representative sample of low birthweight and non-low-birthweight children, with multiple data collection points at very young ages, to examine developmental patterns of cognitive delay at 9, 24, 48, and 60 months of age, and how these are related to poverty, low birthweight, and their correlates, including single parenthood and racial/ethnic minority status; and 2) To test three types of post-birth risk factors as potential explanations for the relationships between (a) poverty, low birthweight, and their correlates, and (b) cognitive disability at 9, 24, 48, and 60 months. These additional risk factors are poor child health, inadequate parenting, and low quality childcare. The project will address these aims by fitting generalized linear mixed models to ECLS-B data for children at 9, 24, 48, and 60 months of age. In these models, child physical health, parenting quality, and caregiving will appear as time-varying covariates. By providing accurate estimates of the factors that elevate a child's risk for cognitive delay, the project will help identify promising avenues for early intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young children with cognitive delays are at high risk for a range of negative long-term health and social outcomes. This project will capitalize on the availability of a new, nationally representative dataset to illuminate the multiple pathways that lead to cognitive delay during young childhood, and identify promising avenues for early intervention.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young children with cognitive delays are at high risk for a range of negative long-term health and social outcomes.

"White matter hyperintensities in Aging and Dementia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the elderly population increases, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an escalating public health threat. Research suggests that there are multiple pathways that lead to the development and expression of AD. Small vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), is common in normal aging and is associated with normal age-related cognitive decline. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that cerebrovascular disease may also play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Work from our laboratory shows that WMH are increased among those at risk for AD; are more severe among patients with AD; and predict the rate of cognitive decline among those with AD. These initial observations strongly indicate that it is essential to demonstrate that longitudinal progression of WMH is related to cognitive decline and incident AD in order to establish causality. The overall aim of this study is to examine how the progression of small vessel vascular disease contributes to cognitive decline and incident AD. This study interfaces with ongoing follow up of the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP; P01 AG07232), a community-based epidemiological study of aging and dementia. Beginning in 2003, MRI scans were acquired on a subset of 717 non-demented elderly participants. The current study seeks to re-evaluate these participants with follow up MRI 6 years after their baseline scans. Advanced MRI analysis techniques will be applied to quantify the degree o f WMH change in major neuroanatomical regions. Cerebral microbleeds, a marker of amyloid angiopathy, will also be quantified to explore their association with WMH. The aims include: 1. To examine the longitudinal change in regional WMH with cognitive decline and incident AD. 2. To examine whether severity and WMH change accounts for ethnic group differences in incident AD. 3. To examine the association of WMH distribution and lobar microbleeds, a putative marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, among patients with AD and controls. Exploratory aims will examine interrelations among WMH, white matter microstructure, hippocampal volume, and cognition. Findings from this study will clarify the role of small vessel vascular disease in the pathogenesis of cognitive aging and AD, will determine if small vessel vascular disease is a source of ethnic group disparities in AD, and will begin to elucidate the mechanism linking vascular disease to AD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase. This project will identify and characterize vascular factors that may contribute to the development and expression of the disease. It will also identify important factors that may account for ethnic-group disparities in Alzheimer's disease.            Narrative Thepevlenceo

"Population-Based Study of MCI Heterogeneity in African American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is a postdoctoral fellow at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville with diverse training and research experience in neuropsychology. The candidate's career goal is to become an independent investigator in the area of cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, with a particular focus on minority populations. The proposed multidisciplinary training program will provide the candidate with a mentored research experience in MCI and dementia within the framework of the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and structured didactic training in epidemiology and longitudinal research methods. The proposed study endeavors to address a critical gap in our current understanding of the transition between normal aging and early dementia. African Americans demonstrate elevated rates of numerous biomedical and psychosocial risk factors for dementia, and thus constitute a particularly vulnerable demographic group for disease onset. Indeed, epidemiological evidence suggests that the incidence, prevalence, and lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among African American elders may be twice that of Caucasians. Therefore, the characterization of MCI within this demographic group is of paramount importance. Recent consensus has highlighted the heterogeneous nature of MCI, and it is now clear that at least three clinical subtypes may represent distinct diagnostic and etiological entities (i.e., amnestic MCI; multiple domain MCI with or without memory impairment; single domain MCI). The proposed study is a population-based, cross-sectional investigation of the relationship between health, genetic, and psychosocial factors, and MCI heterogeneity in African Americans aged 65 and older. Specifically, the proposed study aims to: 1) estimate the proportion of MCI clinical subtypes in African Americans aged 65 and older, and 2) investigate the independent and multivariate relationship between health, genetic, and psychosocial factors and MCI subtypes in this demographic group. The geographic target area for this study will consist of 15 contiguous census tracts in Duval County (Jacksonville, Florida), in which at least 80% of individuals of age 65 and older are African American. Ultimately, the proposed research program will address a major public health disparity concern, namely, the increased incidence of AD in the African American population and its prevention via the early and reliable identification of individuals with MCI.

"Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline in African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive decline associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common and debilitating conditions, and poses a large and increasing public health problem. Projections indicate that the prevalence of aging-related chronic conditions is expected to increase substantially in the next decade. This will be particularly true for minority populations, especially the older African American population, which is growing at an even more rapid pace than the older White population. The Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) is a longitudinal cohort study of more than 350 older African Americans without dementia who agreed to annual clinical evaluations. During the previous project period we identified several risk factors for cognitive decline in African Americans. The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to quantify three common neuropathologic indices including Alzheimer's disease pathology, cerebral infarctions, and Lewy bodies in MARS participants, and examine their associations to cognitive function and clinical risk factors. In addition, to increase power and examine racial differences in these associations, we propose to use existing longitudinal clinical and neuropathologic data on Whites from two other ongoing cohort studies at Rush. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) examine the association of the three post-mortem neuropathologic indices to 1a: level of global cognition and five cognitive abilities, 1b: change in global cognition and five cognitive abilities; 2) examine racial differences in the associations of neuropathology to level of and change in cognitive function; 3) test the hypothesis that the APOE e4 allele is associated with increased levels of AD pathology, and the 52 allele is associated with a lower level of AD pathology in African Americans; and 4) examine the relationship of BMI to neuropathology, and test the hypothesis that BMI is more strongly associated with AD pathology in Whites than in African Americans. There is limited data on the neuropathologic basis of cognitive impairment in African Americans. Integrating post-mortem indices into a study of risk factors for cognitive decline in one of the fastest growing minority groups is highly innovative and has the potential to greatly increase understanding of the ways in which risk factors interact with neuropathology to influence cognition and racial disparities in cognitive test performance. Further, the findings could have important implications for therapeutic intervention and disease prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine the association of Alzheimer disease pathology and other common neuropathologic indices on risk factors and change in cognitive function over time in older African Americans. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on cognitive function and biological and clinical risk factors of interest from the prior project period and supplement it with quantitative postmortem measurements on more than 100 African Americans. Findings from this study are expected to provide a better understanding of the extent to which neuropathologic indices contribute to cognitive impairment in African Americans, and how pathology may interact with important risk factors to effect racial differences in cognitive function.            PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will examine the association of Alzheimer disease pathology and other common neuropathologic indices on risk factors and change in cognitive function over time in older African Americans.

"New Approaches to Dementia Heterogeneity The new Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has made remarkable progress in just four years, developing new diagnostic approaches to dementia, supporting exciting translational and basic science research and providing training and education at a local and national level. We remain committed to four overarching aims: 1) to explore heterogeneous presentations of dementia in the early stages; 2) to train new basic and translational science leaders in dementia; 3) to educate regarding the non-AD dementias and atypical presentations of AD using conferences and novel web-based approaches; and 4) to bridge the gap between clinical and laboratory studies in dementia by supporting new treatment efforts for AD, FTLD and CJD. With renewal, we will develop better ways to diagnose patients with early FTLD, CBD, PSP, CJD and atypical AD. We will catalyze the development of rational therapies for FTLD with ubiquitin-TDP-43 inclusions, FTLD with tau inclusions, and FTLD associated with progranulin mutations. To generate successful new therapies, we will create effective animal models of disease (Farese project 3) and enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis using our Clinical Core and novel imaging approaches (Seeley project 1). We will involve investigators at the Gladstone Institute such as Lennart Mucke (project 2), Yadong Huang, Li Can, and Robert Mahley in the evaluation of ADRC tissue to bring laboratory findings to the clinic. We will also interact with the CJD drug development program in the Prusiner and DeArmond laboratories by providing well-characterized patients and biosamples. By developing an internet-based approach to education, we will reach tens of thousands of people every year, educating them about dementia, its symptoms, causes and available treatments. We will also host novel and exciting conferences and retreats that generate enthusiasm for our field. To spearhead dementia research, we will continue to attract, train and nurture future leaders in neurodegenerative disease, both in clinical and basic science research. To address the inequalities among aging minority populations, we will develop a unique cohort of Chinese-American patients and integrate this community into our treatment efforts. To understand why some people are able to stave off dementia, we will develop a large healthy aging cohort that will participate in new preventative research efforts. Finally, we will create ideal data management approaches for neurodegenerative conditions that will be shared with other ADRCs, beginning with UC-Davis.

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification.

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist.

"Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study which indicated an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women treated with hormone therapy (HT) led to a reevaluation of the benefits versus harm of hormone interventions. As part of this reevaluation, disparities between the beneficial outcomes of estrogen (E2, ET) and progesterone (P4) found in basic science analyses and the adverse outcomes of clinical trials were clear as were the disparities between the generally positive outcomes of ET and HT in observational studies versus the deleterious outcomes of clinical trials. The Progesterone in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Program Project is designed to address key elements hypothesized to underlie these disparities as well as addressing the paucity of knowledge regarding the neurobiology of progesterone (P4) action in brain regions required for cognition and vulnerable to age associated degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's. The over arching hypothesis of our program is that the ovarian steroid hormone progesterone promotes the brain's molecular, synaptic, cellular, and behavioral plasticity and reduces its vulnerability to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we hypothesize that progesterone has direct effects via activation of progesterone receptors in hippocampus and indirect effects via interaction with estrogen pathways. We further hypothesize that the reproductive endocrine status, duration of ovariprivation and presence of AD related pathology regulates the plasticity response to ovarian steroids. We have designed the Program Project to investigate P4 action at 7 levels of function from molecular to behavioral to exacerbation of AD-like pathology in vivo. Embedded in each proposal is an assessment of: (1) P4 receptor expression; (2) direct effect of P4 on neural plasticity; (3) clinically relevant progestins for their comparability to P4; (3) change in response to E2 and P4 with reproductive endocrine status, age or duration of ovariprivation and (4) E2 and P4 regulation of neural plasticity or inflammatory responses in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Our long-term goals are three fold: (1) To establish a foundation of P4 neurobiology in brain regions required for cognitive function and vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease. (2) To develop rodent models of human perimenopause and menopause for both our investigations and those within the field of women's health. (3) To provide insights into the basis of disparities between basic science outcomes and clinical trial outcomes as well as the disparities between observational studies and clinical trials of HT and AD.

"Screening and Diagnosis of Mild Alzheimer's Disease in Latino Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Five years ago, the Alzheimer Association warned of a ""looming"" crisis in the Latino/Hispanic community due to a projected six-fold increase in the number of Latino/Hispanic elders suffering from AD and related dementias by 2050. Vascular risk factors, which are elevated in Latino/Hispanic patients, are associated with cognitive decline and the risk of AD, VaD and concomitant AD and VaD (AD/VaD). Access to diagnosis and treatment is hampered by language proficiency, personal beliefs, and economic status, delaying diagnosis by as many as five years. Because most elderly patients see a primary care physician several times a year, there is an opportunity to identify patients with mild AD and related dementias. Unfortunately, recognition of mild dementia in primary care is poor because accurate and efficient case finding methods are lacking to identify mild dementia in disparity groups. Misclassification rates are high for Latino/Hispanic patients and for patients with low education when the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) is used to identify cases. The need for a case finding tool that works equally well in disparity groups prompted our development of the two-stage Alzheimer's Disease Screen for Primary Care (ADS-PC) to identify mild dementia and AD in disparity groups. The first stage takes just five minutes and is designed for high sensitivity. The second stage is given only to the 30% of patients who fail the first stage and takes just 12 minutes. The ADS-PC has better operating characteristics and is more time efficient than the MMSE. It works equally well in African American and Caucasian individuals and in those with low and high education. In this R21, we extend our case-finding efforts to Spanish speaking elders from a federally qualified community health center that serves a largely Latino/Hispanic community in the South Bronx. 500 Spanish speaking patients will be screened with the ADS-PC to identify individuals likely to have dementia. Screen positive patients (~75) and a random sample of screen negative controls (~75) will undergo a research quality evaluation to determine the clinical standard (dementia, no dementia) against which the concurrent construct validity of the ADS-PC will be assessed. We will compare the operating characteristics of ADS-PC and the MMSE and determine the most accurate and efficient way to identify cases of mild dementia and AD. Diagnostic information and treatment recommendations will be provided to the patient's physician. Unless recognition of mild dementia in primary care improves, the current generation of proven pharmacological and behavioral interventions and future disease modifying treatments will not be available to minority patients and individuals with low education, ensuring a disparity in dementia treatment and prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Five years ago, the Alzheimer Association warned of a ""looming"" crisis in the Latino/Hispanic community due to a projected six-fold increase in the number of Latino elders suffering from AD and related dementias by 2050. Unfortunately, recognition of mild dementia is poor in primary care settings where most Latino/Hispanic elders receive their care. Prompted by the lack of accurate and efficient case finding methods to identify mild dementia in disparity groups, we have developed and validated an efficient and cost-effective tool to identify patients with early dementia and AD in primary care settings. In this R21, we extend our case-finding efforts to Spanish speaking patients from a federally qualified community health center that serves a largely Latino/Hispanic community in the South Bronx. Screen positive patients and a random sample of screen negative controls will undergo a research quality evaluation to determine dementia status.

"HANDLS Scan Substudy: Race, Socioeconomic status, and the Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pronounced health disparities associated with race and socioeconomic status (SES) are noted for brain health endpoints including stroke (particularly at younger ages), dementia, brain structure on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive decline, and functional disability. Efforts are needed to disentangle respective influences of race and SES on brain health, particularly early and subtle markers of pathology predictive of future stroke and dementia. MRI- assessed measures of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume and diffusion tensor imaging measures of WM microstructure offer such proven associations. Also critical is identification of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to subtle brain pathology. Biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social and environmental factors have been implicated as potential mediators of the relations of race and SES to many physical health outcomes, but exceedingly little is known about these pathways with respect to brain health. MRI indices of subtle brain pathology may also mediate relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Here we propose an interdisciplinary, ancillary study to the Healthy Aging In Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS). HANDLS study is a new 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the National Institute on Aging's Intramural Research Program focused on understanding health disparities among 4,000 socioeconomically diverse African-Americans (AA) and Whites living in Baltimore, MD. HANDLS is uniquely designed to disentangle the respective relations of race and SES to health outcomes. In HANDLS SCAN we propose to obtain quantitative MRI data from 500 (250 AA, 250 White; ages 30-64) stroke- and dementia-free HANDLS participants with a full range of SES to: (1) Examine race- and SES-related disparities in GM and WM volume, and WM microstructure (2) Examine multi-level mediators - biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental - of the relations of race and SES to GM and WM; and (3) Examine whether GM and WM are proximal mediators of the relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Structural equation modeling will be used to construct increasingly complex models to address these interrelated aims. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An understanding of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to early and subtle markers of brain pathology, and the relation of brain pathology to cognitive and physical function, is needed to facilitate appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline.

and physical function, is needed to facilitate appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in stroke, dementia, and

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.              ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification.

"Lifecourse Pathways to Racial Disparities in Late-Life Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial gap in cognitive impairment and dementia has emerged as a serious public health problem. Researchers using nationally representative data estimated that among those aged 71 years and older Blacks were approximately two times more likely to have dementia than Whites. Blacks also had four times greater risk of having mild cognitive impairment than Whites. The epidemic of cognitive impairment and dementia among older Blacks will worsen in future years as the number of Blacks aged 65 and over will more than double by 2030, increasing from 2.8 million in 2000 to 7.2 million by 2030. Despite developments in understanding the risk factors associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in recent years, very few population-based studies have investigated the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of the racial gap in cognitive impairment. The proposed investigation will carefully define the magnitude of the gap in cognitive impairment, the proximal and distal factors associated with the gap, and the consequences of the gap for cognitive-impairment-free life expectancy for older Blacks and Whites. Data come from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing nationally representative, longitudinal survey of Americans 51 years of age and older and Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS). ADAMS is part of the HRS in that a subset of HRS respondents aged 70 years and older were clinically assessed and assigned a diagnosis of dementia, cognitive impairment but not demented (CIND), or normal cognition. Specifically, we aim to 1) examine the sensitivity and specificity of the HRS cognitive functioning measures as a screening tool for cognitive impairment and dementia for Blacks and Whites respectively; 2) examine life course pathways associated with the racial gap in cognitive impairment; 3) estimate life expectancy with and without cognitive impairment for Blacks and Whites by gender and childhood conditions. The analysis will be based on the 1998-2008 waves of HRS. Models of both prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment will be estimated for persons aged 70 years and older.

"New Approaches to Dementia Heterogeneity The new Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has made remarkable progress in just four years, developing new diagnostic approaches to dementia, supporting exciting translational and basic science research and providing training and education at a local and national level. We remain committed to four overarching aims: 1) to explore heterogeneous presentations of dementia in the early stages; 2) to train new basic and translational science leaders in dementia; 3) to educate regarding the non-AD dementias and atypical presentations of AD using conferences and novel web-based approaches; and 4) to bridge the gap between clinical and laboratory studies in dementia by supporting new treatment efforts for AD, FTLD and CJD. With renewal, we will develop better ways to diagnose patients with early FTLD, CBD, PSP, CJD and atypical AD. We will catalyze the development of rational therapies for FTLD with ubiquitin-TDP-43 inclusions, FTLD with tau inclusions, and FTLD associated with progranulin mutations. To generate successful new therapies, we will create effective animal models of disease (Farese project 3) and enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis using our Clinical Core and novel imaging approaches (Seeley project 1). We will involve investigators at the Gladstone Institute such as Lennart Mucke (project 2), Yadong Huang, Li Can, and Robert Mahley in the evaluation of ADRC tissue to bring laboratory findings to the clinic. We will also interact with the CJD drug development program in the Prusiner and DeArmond laboratories by providing well-characterized patients and biosamples. By developing an internet-based approach to education, we will reach tens of thousands of people every year, educating them about dementia, its symptoms, causes and available treatments. We will also host novel and exciting conferences and retreats that generate enthusiasm for our field. To spearhead dementia research, we will continue to attract, train and nurture future leaders in neurodegenerative disease, both in clinical and basic science research. To address the inequalities among aging minority populations, we will develop a unique cohort of Chinese-American patients and integrate this community into our treatment efforts. To understand why some people are able to stave off dementia, we will develop a large healthy aging cohort that will participate in new preventative research efforts. Finally, we will create ideal data management approaches for neurodegenerative conditions that will be shared with other ADRCs, beginning with UC-Davis.

"White matter hyperintensities in Aging and Dementia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the elderly population increases, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an escalating public health threat. Research suggests that there are multiple pathways that lead to the development and expression of AD. Small vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), is common in normal aging and is associated with normal age-related cognitive decline. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that cerebrovascular disease may also play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Work from our laboratory shows that WMH are increased among those at risk for AD; are more severe among patients with AD; and predict the rate of cognitive decline among those with AD. These initial observations strongly indicate that it is essential to demonstrate that longitudinal progression of WMH is related to cognitive decline and incident AD in order to establish causality. The overall aim of this study is to examine how the progression of small vessel vascular disease contributes to cognitive decline and incident AD. This study interfaces with ongoing follow up of the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP; P01 AG07232), a community-based epidemiological study of aging and dementia. Beginning in 2003, MRI scans were acquired on a subset of 717 non-demented elderly participants. The current study seeks to re-evaluate these participants with follow up MRI 6 years after their baseline scans. Advanced MRI analysis techniques will be applied to quantify the degree o f WMH change in major neuroanatomical regions. Cerebral microbleeds, a marker of amyloid angiopathy, will also be quantified to explore their association with WMH. The aims include: 1. To examine the longitudinal change in regional WMH with cognitive decline and incident AD. 2. To examine whether severity and WMH change accounts for ethnic group differences in incident AD. 3. To examine the association of WMH distribution and lobar microbleeds, a putative marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, among patients with AD and controls. Exploratory aims will examine interrelations among WMH, white matter microstructure, hippocampal volume, and cognition. Findings from this study will clarify the role of small vessel vascular disease in the pathogenesis of cognitive aging and AD, will determine if small vessel vascular disease is a source of ethnic group disparities in AD, and will begin to elucidate the mechanism linking vascular disease to AD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase. This project will identify and characterize vascular factors that may contribute to the development and expression of the disease. It will also identify important factors that may account for ethnic-group disparities in Alzheimer's disease.            Narrative Thepevlenceo

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.              ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification.

"Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline in African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive decline associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common and debilitating conditions, and poses a large and increasing public health problem. Projections indicate that the prevalence of aging-related chronic conditions is expected to increase substantially in the next decade. This will be particularly true for minority populations, especially the older African American population, which is growing at an even more rapid pace than the older White population. The Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) is a longitudinal cohort study of more than 350 older African Americans without dementia who agreed to annual clinical evaluations. During the previous project period we identified several risk factors for cognitive decline in African Americans. The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to quantify three common neuropathologic indices including Alzheimer's disease pathology, cerebral infarctions, and Lewy bodies in MARS participants, and examine their associations to cognitive function and clinical risk factors. In addition, to increase power and examine racial differences in these associations, we propose to use existing longitudinal clinical and neuropathologic data on Whites from two other ongoing cohort studies at Rush. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) examine the association of the three post-mortem neuropathologic indices to 1a: level of global cognition and five cognitive abilities, 1b: change in global cognition and five cognitive abilities; 2) examine racial differences in the associations of neuropathology to level of and change in cognitive function; 3) test the hypothesis that the APOE e4 allele is associated with increased levels of AD pathology, and the 52 allele is associated with a lower level of AD pathology in African Americans; and 4) examine the relationship of BMI to neuropathology, and test the hypothesis that BMI is more strongly associated with AD pathology in Whites than in African Americans. There is limited data on the neuropathologic basis of cognitive impairment in African Americans. Integrating post-mortem indices into a study of risk factors for cognitive decline in one of the fastest growing minority groups is highly innovative and has the potential to greatly increase understanding of the ways in which risk factors interact with neuropathology to influence cognition and racial disparities in cognitive test performance. Further, the findings could have important implications for therapeutic intervention and disease prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine the association of Alzheimer disease pathology and other common neuropathologic indices on risk factors and change in cognitive function over time in older African Americans. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on cognitive function and biological and clinical risk factors of interest from the prior project period and supplement it with quantitative postmortem measurements on more than 100 African Americans. Findings from this study are expected to provide a better understanding of the extent to which neuropathologic indices contribute to cognitive impairment in African Americans, and how pathology may interact with important risk factors to effect racial differences in cognitive function.            PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will examine the association of Alzheimer disease pathology and other common neuropathologic indices on risk factors and change in cognitive function over time in older African Americans.

"HANDLS Scan Substudy: Race, Socioeconomic status, and the Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pronounced health disparities associated with race and socioeconomic status (SES) are noted for brain health endpoints including stroke (particularly at younger ages), dementia, brain structure on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive decline, and functional disability. Efforts are needed to disentangle respective influences of race and SES on brain health, particularly early and subtle markers of pathology predictive of future stroke and dementia. MRI- assessed measures of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume and diffusion tensor imaging measures of WM microstructure offer such proven associations. Also critical is identification of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to subtle brain pathology. Biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social and environmental factors have been implicated as potential mediators of the relations of race and SES to many physical health outcomes, but exceedingly little is known about these pathways with respect to brain health. MRI indices of subtle brain pathology may also mediate relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Here we propose an interdisciplinary, ancillary study to the Healthy Aging In Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS). HANDLS study is a new 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the National Institute on Aging's Intramural Research Program focused on understanding health disparities among 4,000 socioeconomically diverse African-Americans (AA) and Whites living in Baltimore, MD. HANDLS is uniquely designed to disentangle the respective relations of race and SES to health outcomes. In HANDLS SCAN we propose to obtain quantitative MRI data from 500 (250 AA, 250 White; ages 30-64) stroke- and dementia-free HANDLS participants with a full range of SES to: (1) Examine race- and SES-related disparities in GM and WM volume, and WM microstructure (2) Examine multi-level mediators - biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental - of the relations of race and SES to GM and WM; and (3) Examine whether GM and WM are proximal mediators of the relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Structural equation modeling will be used to construct increasingly complex models to address these interrelated aims. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An understanding of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to early and subtle markers of brain pathology, and the relation of brain pathology to cognitive and physical function, is needed to facilitate appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Relevance An understanding of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to early and subtle markers of brain pathology,

"White matter hyperintensities in Aging and Dementia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the elderly population increases, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an escalating public health threat. Research suggests that there are multiple pathways that lead to the development and expression of AD. Small vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), is common in normal aging and is associated with normal age-related cognitive decline. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that cerebrovascular disease may also play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Work from our laboratory shows that WMH are increased among those at risk for AD; are more severe among patients with AD; and predict the rate of cognitive decline among those with AD. These initial observations strongly indicate that it is essential to demonstrate that longitudinal progression of WMH is related to cognitive decline and incident AD in order to establish causality. The overall aim of this study is to examine how the progression of small vessel vascular disease contributes to cognitive decline and incident AD. This study interfaces with ongoing follow up of the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP; P01 AG07232), a community-based epidemiological study of aging and dementia. Beginning in 2003, MRI scans were acquired on a subset of 717 non-demented elderly participants. The current study seeks to re-evaluate these participants with follow up MRI 6 years after their baseline scans. Advanced MRI analysis techniques will be applied to quantify the degree o f WMH change in major neuroanatomical regions. Cerebral microbleeds, a marker of amyloid angiopathy, will also be quantified to explore their association with WMH. The aims include: 1. To examine the longitudinal change in regional WMH with cognitive decline and incident AD. 2. To examine whether severity and WMH change accounts for ethnic group differences in incident AD. 3. To examine the association of WMH distribution and lobar microbleeds, a putative marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, among patients with AD and controls. Exploratory aims will examine interrelations among WMH, white matter microstructure, hippocampal volume, and cognition. Findings from this study will clarify the role of small vessel vascular disease in the pathogenesis of cognitive aging and AD, will determine if small vessel vascular disease is a source of ethnic group disparities in AD, and will begin to elucidate the mechanism linking vascular disease to AD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase. This project will identify and characterize vascular factors that may contribute to the development and expression of the disease. It will also identify important factors that may account for ethnic-group disparities in Alzheimer's disease.

"1 of 5 ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.

"Integrating neuroimaging with studies of cognitive aging in the Dominican Republi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ongoing research in our center in Northern Manhattan has consistently shown that the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia are greater among older Caribbean Hispanics, predominantly from Dominican Republic, than among Caucasians. Despite the consistency of this observation, the causes for this health disparity remain elusive. Individuals from low and middle income countries, such as Dominican Republic, may be at increased risk because of the interacting influences of socioeconomic factors, unique genetic risk factors, and high representation of cerebrovascular disease. The proposed work, in response to PAR-11-031, Brain disorders in the developing world: Research across the lifespan, seeks ultimately to understand the sources of this disparity by building a collaboration with investigators in Santiago, Dominican Republic to integrate high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into ongoing genetic studies of cognitive aging. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to quantify small and large cerebrovascular disease (e.g., infarct, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds) and to examine markers of neurodegeneration (e.g., hippocampus atrophy). The Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica de Alzheimer (EFIGA; NIH R37 AG015473 PI: R. Mayeux) [Family Study of the Genetic Influence of Alzheimer's Disease] is a large scale longitudinal genetic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) comprising individuals with and without AD from families with and without strong histories of the disease; there are over 4,500 active older adult participants, over 2,700 of whom reside in in Santiago. Our proposed pilot study will collect MRI scans in Santiago on 70 active participants from EFIGA and integrate MRI data with clinical and genetic data collected as part of the parent project. We will explore the relationships of markers of cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration with demographic factors, cognitive function/diagnosis, and genetics. We will establish feasibility and pilot data for a prospective, large-scale MRI project of cognitive aging and genetics, carried out in Santiago. As part of the efforts proposed here, we will work towards establishing the local capacity to acquire standardized MRI data and carry out MRI analysis for research involving older adults. Finally, we aim to introduce formal and informal training opportunities on interdisciplinary cognitive aging research via clinical preceptorship, formal didactics, ongoing active collaboration, and a symposium. The proposed project will result in a strong collaboration poised to uncover sources of disparities of cognitive aging among Caribbean Hispanics.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Suboptimal cognitive aging is becoming a true pandemic, particularly in Latin America, where the prevalence of dementia is the highest globally. The proposed project will integrate magnetic resonance imaging into ongoing studies of cognitive aging in Santiago, Dominican Republic, with the ultimate goal of understanding what factors contribute to health disparities in cognitive impairment among Caribbean Hispanics. Integration of neuroimaging into studies of cognitive aging may improve cognitive outcomes in an aging population through the identification of novel and specific treatment targets for intervention and prevention.                   Suboptimal cognitive aging is becoming a true pandemic, particularly in Latin America, where the prevalence of dementia is the highest globally.

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.

"Screening and Diagnosis of Mild Alzheimer's Disease in Latino Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Five years ago, the Alzheimer Association warned of a ""looming"" crisis in the Latino/Hispanic community due to a projected six-fold increase in the number of Latino/Hispanic elders suffering from AD and related dementias by 2050. Vascular risk factors, which are elevated in Latino/Hispanic patients, are associated with cognitive decline and the risk of AD, VaD and concomitant AD and VaD (AD/VaD). Access to diagnosis and treatment is hampered by language proficiency, personal beliefs, and economic status, delaying diagnosis by as many as five years. Because most elderly patients see a primary care physician several times a year, there is an opportunity to identify patients with mild AD and related dementias. Unfortunately, recognition of mild dementia in primary care is poor because accurate and efficient case finding methods are lacking to identify mild dementia in disparity groups. Misclassification rates are high for Latino/Hispanic patients and for patients with low education when the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) is used to identify cases. The need for a case finding tool that works equally well in disparity groups prompted our development of the two-stage Alzheimer's Disease Screen for Primary Care (ADS-PC) to identify mild dementia and AD in disparity groups. The first stage takes just five minutes and is designed for high sensitivity. The second stage is given only to the 30% of patients who fail the first stage and takes just 12 minutes. The ADS-PC has better operating characteristics and is more time efficient than the MMSE. It works equally well in African American and Caucasian individuals and in those with low and high education. In this R21, we extend our case-finding efforts to Spanish speaking elders from a federally qualified community health center that serves a largely Latino/Hispanic community in the South Bronx. 500 Spanish speaking patients will be screened with the ADS-PC to identify individuals likely to have dementia. Screen positive patients (~75) and a random sample of screen negative controls (~75) will undergo a research quality evaluation to determine the clinical standard (dementia, no dementia) against which the concurrent construct validity of the ADS-PC will be assessed. We will compare the operating characteristics of ADS-PC and the MMSE and determine the most accurate and efficient way to identify cases of mild dementia and AD. Diagnostic information and treatment recommendations will be provided to the patient's physician. Unless recognition of mild dementia in primary care improves, the current generation of proven pharmacological and behavioral interventions and future disease modifying treatments will not be available to minority patients and individuals with low education, ensuring a disparity in dementia treatment and prevention.        Five years ago, the Alzheimer Association warned of a ""looming"" crisis in the Latino/Hispanic community due to a projected six-fold increase in the number of Latino elders suffering from AD and related dementias by 2050. Unfortunately, recognition of mild dementia is poor in primary care settings where most Latino/Hispanic elders receive their care. Prompted by the lack of accurate and efficient case finding methods to identify mild dementia in disparity groups, we have developed and validated an efficient and cost-effective tool to identify patients with early dementia and AD in primary care settings. In this R21, we extend our case-finding efforts to Spanish speaking patients from a federally qualified community health center that serves a largely Latino/Hispanic community in the South Bronx. Screen positive patients and a random sample of screen negative controls will undergo a research quality evaluation to determine dementia status. This will be the standard against which the accuracy of our case finding tool will be assessed. We will compare the operating characteristics of our case finding tool with the most widely used dementia screening test and determine the most accurate and efficient way to identify cases of mild dementia in Latino/Hispanic elders.

"Lifecourse Pathways to Racial Disparities in Late-Life Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial gap in cognitive impairment and dementia has emerged as a serious public health problem. Researchers using nationally representative data estimated that among those aged 71 years and older Blacks were approximately two times more likely to have dementia than Whites. Blacks also had four times greater risk of having mild cognitive impairment than Whites. The epidemic of cognitive impairment and dementia among older Blacks will worsen in future years as the number of Blacks aged 65 and over will more than double by 2030, increasing from 2.8 million in 2000 to 7.2 million by 2030. Despite developments in understanding the risk factors associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in recent years, very few population-based studies have investigated the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of the racial gap in cognitive impairment. The proposed investigation will carefully define the magnitude of the gap in cognitive impairment, the proximal and distal factors associated with the gap, and the consequences of the gap for cognitive-impairment-free life expectancy for older Blacks and Whites. Data come from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing nationally representative, longitudinal survey of Americans 51 years of age and older and Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS). ADAMS is part of the HRS in that a subset of HRS respondents aged 70 years and older were clinically assessed and assigned a diagnosis of dementia, cognitive impairment but not demented (CIND), or normal cognition. Specifically, we aim to 1) examine the sensitivity and specificity of the HRS cognitive functioning measures as a screening tool for cognitive impairment and dementia for Blacks and Whites respectively; 2) examine life course pathways associated with the racial gap in cognitive impairment; 3) estimate life expectancy with and without cognitive impairment for Blacks and Whites by gender and childhood conditions. The analysis will be based on the 1998-2008 waves of HRS. Models of both prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment will be estimated for persons aged 70 years and older. The findings from this research will advance our understandings of the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of racial gaps in cognitive impairment and can help policy makers and public health professionals design effective interventions to reduce racial disparities in cognitive impairment and make plans for the associated health care and long-term care needs of those suffering from cognitive impairment.        The primary goal of the project is to examine the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of racial gaps in cognitive impairment. Results from this project could potentially help policy makers and public health professionals design effective interventions to reduce racial disparities in cognitive health and make plans for the associated health care and long-term care needs for older Blacks and Whites suffering from cognitive impairment.

"Interdisciplinary Lifecourse Approaches to African American Cognitive Aging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this scientific meeting application is to create an interdisciplinary research team that will lay the theoretical and methodological groundwork for novel investigation of the neuroscience of cognitive aging among African Americans. The central goal of this team's work will be to provide the foundation needed to close critical gaps in knowledge and to enhance the quality, innovation, and productivity of cognitive aging research among African Americans. This interdisciplinary team of neuropsychologists, cognitive psychologists, neuroscientists, epidemiologists, gerontologists, statisticians, sociologists, and geneticists, will produce a blueprint for research on cognitive aging among African Americans that will facilitate new discoveries about the impact of socio-cultural experiences throughout the life span on brain health. By incorporating measures of these diverse experiences of African Americans, from childhood to older age, into research on the neuroscience of aging, complex interactions between cognition, cardiovascular health, genetics, brain structure, and brain function can be elucidated. An integrated understanding of these interactions is critical for developing interventions to maintain cognitive health among this understudied population. This objective will be achieved by holding a series of in-person meetings and video conferences that bring together researchers with expertise in diverse research sub-disciplines to promote scientific exchange and develop a comprehensive agenda on African American cognitive aging. At these meetings, the interdisciplinary group will: 1) determine the most innovative models, methodology and analytic approaches to address critical gaps in research knowledge on cognitive aging among African Americans, and will develop a blueprint for research with specific recommendations for future work; 2) determine how existing data or new follow-up data from large, ethnically diverse cohorts of children, young and middle-aged adults, and older persons can be used to address critical research questions in cognitive aging among African Americans; and 3) disseminate recommendations about how to increase numbers of African Americans enrolled in current or planned studies of cognitive aging, by leveraging resources already created by RCMARs and other NIH-funded studies that have been successful with minority recruitment, and integration of community-based participatory research (CBPR).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior studies show that African Americans have higher prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia as compared with non-Hispanic Whites. However, our understanding of the reasons for this disparity, risk factors for cognitive impairment, and early markers of future decline among African Americans has lagged behind our understanding of these factors among Whites. The proposed scientific meeting will address this gap in knowledge using an interdisciplinary approach, and is timely given the rapid population growth of older African Americans.                  Prior studies show that African Americans have higher prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia as compared with non-Hispanic Whites.

"Webnovela for Hispanic Dementia Family Caregivers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every 69 seconds someone in US develops Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementia, affecting not only patients, but family caregivers (~15 million), largely untrained and neglected by the healthcare system, with high incidence of stress (60 percent) and depression (33 percent) due to difficulties of caregiving. A large underserved group is Hispanic, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group, facing several health disparities and barriers to care: higher incidence of Alzheimer's (e.g. 63 percent versus 30 percent for Caucasians age 85 years and over); greater depression in Hispanics (45 percent) than in other groups; limited medical insurance; language proficiency issues; lack of knowledge about dementia; greater need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, fewer culturally appropriate interventions, etc Besides materials in Spanish language, culturally appropriate interventions are also needed, because they are more effective, as racial/ethnic identity influences beliefs about dementia and family care giving role, affecting how families cope with dementia care giving and respond to interventions. Another major challenge for effective Hispanic interventions is the retention of participants and adherence to healthcare programs. We propose a new intervention called Webnovela (WN), a short online Telenovela in Spanish, specifically designed for Hispanic caregivers on how to cope with dementia care giving, reduce burden of care, decrease stress, and alleviate depression. A DVD with our Telenovela will also be created for non-Internet users. As Telenovela, a limited-run ""television novel"" drama, is one of the most popular television genres for Hispanics, a ""Telenovela"" intervention is likely to increase the subject retention and intervention adherence. A Webnovela also has a high potential, since Internet is very appealing to Hispanics, with a high number of online Hispanics (30 million in 2010), and growing two times faster than overall US online population. Research on Telenovela-based behavioral interventions is an unexplored field. WN is one of the first (if not the first one for dementia caregivers). The novel WN incorporates: (a) psychoeducation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which are very effective behavioral interventions to reduce stress/depression; (b) translation and adaptation of evidence-based curriculums into a culturally sensitive short Telenovela for Hispanics; and (c) creative use of Telenovela medium to engage and motivate users to follow the intervention. Related clinical advantages are: encourage caregiver participation, enhance intervention adherence, and enable better assimilation of skills; which should enhance caregivers' skills to deal with demanding tasks of care giving, reduce burden of care, improve quality of life, decrease stress, and help to alleviate depression. In partnership with the Alzheimer's Association, expert Advisory Board and caregivers, we will develop and evaluate a prototype in Phase I. We will assess the effectiveness of the complete WN (with all modules) in improving well-being, decreasing stress, and alleviating depression with a randomized clinical trial in Phase II.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Besides affecting 15 million dementia family caregivers in US, who provide 17 billion hours of unpaid care and are at high risk for stress/depression related to the difficulties of dementia care giving (depression rate of 33 percent), Alzheimer's has also a growing impact on Hispanics, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group in US, which is of increasing importance, because the number of Hispanic AD patients is likely to grow at an alarming rate, as the elderly Hispanic population (age 65+) is projected to grow the fastest of all racial/ethnic groups, from about 3 million (2008) to 17 millio (2050). Hispanics also face several health disparities and barriers to care, such as higher incidence of Alzheimer's (e.g. 63 percent for Hispanics vs. 30 percent for Caucasians age 85+), greater depression (45 percent incidence rate among Hispanic caregivers), limited medical insurance, lower educational level, lower household income, higher poverty rate, language proficiency issues, lack of knowledge about dementia, higher need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, and lack of specific tools and culturally appropriate interventios to cope with care giving. After Phase II is completed, the expected outcomes of our project are the following: reduce Hispanic dementia caregiver stress/depression, enhance quality of life, decrease burden of care, and increase coping skills; in addition, we expect the following potential indirect outcomes (not measured by this study): delay institutionalization of dementia patients, reduce caregiver medication, and thereby decrease economic costs.              Besides affecting 15 million dementia family caregivers in US, who provide 17 billion hours of unpaid care and are at high risk for stress/depression related to the difficulties of dementia care giving (depression rate of 33 percent), Alzheimer's has also a growing impact on Hispanics, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group in US, which is of increasing importance, because the number of Hispanic AD patients is likely to grow at an alarming rate, as the elderly Hispanic population (age 65+) is projected to grow the fastest of all racial/ethnic groups, from about 3 million (2008) to 17 millio (2050).

"New Approaches to Dementia Heterogeneity The new Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has made remarkable progress in just four years, developing new diagnostic approaches to dementia, supporting exciting translational and basic science research and providing training and education at a local and national level. We remain committed to four overarching aims: 1) to explore heterogeneous presentations of dementia in the early stages; 2) to train new basic and translational science leaders in dementia; 3) to educate regarding the non-AD dementias and atypical presentations of AD using conferences and novel web-based approaches; and 4) to bridge the gap between clinical and laboratory studies in dementia by supporting new treatment efforts for AD, FTLD and CJD. With renewal, we will develop better ways to diagnose patients with early FTLD, CBD, PSP, CJD and atypical AD. We will catalyze the development of rational therapies for FTLD with ubiquitin-TDP-43 inclusions, FTLD with tau inclusions, and FTLD associated with progranulin mutations. To generate successful new therapies, we will create effective animal models of disease (Farese project 3) and enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis using our Clinical Core and novel imaging approaches (Seeley project 1). We will involve investigators at the Gladstone Institute such as Lennart Mucke (project 2), Yadong Huang, Li Can, and Robert Mahley in the evaluation of ADRC tissue to bring laboratory findings to the clinic. We will also interact with the CJD drug development program in the Prusiner and DeArmond laboratories by providing well-characterized patients and biosamples. By developing an internet-based approach to education, we will reach tens of thousands of people every year, educating them about dementia, its symptoms, causes and available treatments. We will also host novel and exciting conferences and retreats that generate enthusiasm for our field. To spearhead dementia research, we will continue to attract, train and nurture future leaders in neurodegenerative disease, both in clinical and basic science research. To address the inequalities among aging minority populations, we will develop a unique cohort of Chinese-American patients and integrate this community into our treatment efforts. To understand why some people are able to stave off dementia, we will develop a large healthy aging cohort that will participate in new preventative research efforts. Finally, we will create ideal data management approaches for neurodegenerative conditions that will be shared with other ADRCs, beginning with UC-Davis. The UCSF ADRC enables multidisciplinary investigations of the clinical, imaging, molecular, and pathological features of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and related disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ""healthy aging,"" and promotes the development of novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",New Approaches to Dementia Heterogeneity,8235889,P50AG023501,"['Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathy ', ' Jakob-Creutzfeldt Disease ', ' Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ', ' Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease ', ' CJDs (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) ', ' CJD ', ' Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome ', ' Laboratories ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' San Francisco ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' High Mobility Protein 20 ', ' HMG-20 ', ' ATP-Dependent Proteolysis Factor 1 ', ' APF-1 ', ' Ubiquitin ', ' Universities ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule-associated protein tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule associated protein tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Inequality ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' TDP-43 ', ' protein TDP-43 ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Training and Education ', ' data management ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations ', ' drug development ', ' Commit ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' mild neurocognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' Progranulin ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' healthy aging ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P50,2012,2074665,0.15119808883680796
"HANDLS Scan Substudy: Race, Socioeconomic status, and the Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pronounced health disparities associated with race and socioeconomic status (SES) are noted for brain health endpoints including stroke (particularly at younger ages), dementia, brain structure on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cognitive decline, and functional disability. Efforts are needed to disentangle respective influences of race and SES on brain health, particularly early and subtle markers of pathology predictive of future stroke and dementia. MRI- assessed measures of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume and diffusion tensor imaging measures of WM microstructure offer such proven associations. Also critical is identification of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to subtle brain pathology. Biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social and environmental factors have been implicated as potential mediators of the relations of race and SES to many physical health outcomes, but exceedingly little is known about these pathways with respect to brain health. MRI indices of subtle brain pathology may also mediate relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Here we propose an interdisciplinary, ancillary study to the Healthy Aging In Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS). HANDLS study is a new 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the National Institute on Aging's Intramural Research Program focused on understanding health disparities among 4,000 socioeconomically diverse African-Americans (AA) and Whites living in Baltimore, MD. HANDLS is uniquely designed to disentangle the respective relations of race and SES to health outcomes. In HANDLS SCAN we propose to obtain quantitative MRI data from 500 (250 AA, 250 White; ages 30-64) stroke- and dementia-free HANDLS participants with a full range of SES to: (1) Examine race- and SES-related disparities in GM and WM volume, and WM microstructure (2) Examine multi-level mediators - biomedical, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental - of the relations of race and SES to GM and WM; and (3) Examine whether GM and WM are proximal mediators of the relations of race and SES to cognitive and physical function. Structural equation modeling will be used to construct increasingly complex models to address these interrelated aims. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An understanding of multi-level mediators of the relations of race and SES to early and subtle markers of brain pathology, and the relation of brain pathology to cognitive and physical function, is needed to facilitate appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline.

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes.

"Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline in African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive decline associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common and debilitating conditions, and poses a large and increasing public health problem. Projections indicate that the prevalence of aging-related chronic conditions is expected to increase substantially in the next decade. This will be particularly true for minority populations, especially the older African American population, which is growing at an even more rapid pace than the older White population. The Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) is a longitudinal cohort study of more than 350 older African Americans without dementia who agreed to annual clinical evaluations. During the previous project period we identified several risk factors for cognitive decline in African Americans. The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to quantify three common neuropathologic indices including Alzheimer's disease pathology, cerebral infarctions, and Lewy bodies in MARS participants, and examine their associations to cognitive function and clinical risk factors. In addition, to increase power and examine racial differences in these associations, we propose to use existing longitudinal clinical and neuropathologic data on Whites from two other ongoing cohort studies at Rush. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) examine the association of the three post-mortem neuropathologic indices to 1a: level of global cognition and five cognitive abilities, 1b: change in global cognition and five cognitive abilities; 2) examine racial differences in the associations of neuropathology to level of and change in cognitive function; 3) test the hypothesis that the APOE e4 allele is associated with increased levels of AD pathology, and the 52 allele is associated with a lower level of AD pathology in African Americans; and 4) examine the relationship of BMI to neuropathology, and test the hypothesis that BMI is more strongly associated with AD pathology in Whites than in African Americans. There is limited data on the neuropathologic basis of cognitive impairment in African Americans. Integrating post-mortem indices into a study of risk factors for cognitive decline in one of the fastest growing minority groups is highly innovative and has the potential to greatly increase understanding of the ways in which risk factors interact with neuropathology to influence cognition and racial disparities in cognitive test performance. Further, the findings could have important implications for therapeutic intervention and disease prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine the association of Alzheimer disease pathology and other common neuropathologic indices on risk factors and change in cognitive function over time in older African Americans. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on cognitive function and biological and clinical risk factors of interest from the prior project period and supplement it with quantitative postmortem measurements on more than 100 African Americans. Findings from this study are expected to provide a better understanding of the extent to which neuropathologic indices contribute to cognitive impairment in African Americans, and how pathology may interact with important risk factors to effect racial differences in cognitive function.

"White matter hyperintensities in Aging and Dementia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the elderly population increases, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an escalating public health threat. Research suggests that there are multiple pathways that lead to the development and expression of AD. Small vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), is common in normal aging and is associated with normal age-related cognitive decline. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that cerebrovascular disease may also play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Work from our laboratory shows that WMH are increased among those at risk for AD; are more severe among patients with AD; and predict the rate of cognitive decline among those with AD. These initial observations strongly indicate that it is essential to demonstrate that longitudinal progression of WMH is related to cognitive decline and incident AD in order to establish causality. The overall aim of this study is to examine how the progression of small vessel vascular disease contributes to cognitive decline and incident AD. This study interfaces with ongoing follow up of the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP; P01 AG07232), a community-based epidemiological study of aging and dementia. Beginning in 2003, MRI scans were acquired on a subset of 717 non-demented elderly participants. The current study seeks to re-evaluate these participants with follow up MRI 6 years after their baseline scans. Advanced MRI analysis techniques will be applied to quantify the degree o f WMH change in major neuroanatomical regions. Cerebral microbleeds, a marker of amyloid angiopathy, will also be quantified to explore their association with WMH. The aims include: 1. To examine the longitudinal change in regional WMH with cognitive decline and incident AD. 2. To examine whether severity and WMH change accounts for ethnic group differences in incident AD. 3. To examine the association of WMH distribution and lobar microbleeds, a putative marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, among patients with AD and controls. Exploratory aims will examine interrelations among WMH, white matter microstructure, hippocampal volume, and cognition. Findings from this study will clarify the role of small vessel vascular disease in the pathogenesis of cognitive aging and AD, will determine if small vessel vascular disease is a source of ethnic group disparities in AD, and will begin to elucidate the mechanism linking vascular disease to AD.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase. This project will identify and characterize vascular factors that may contribute to the development and expression of the disease. It will also identify important factors that may account for ethnic-group disparities in Alzheimer's disease.

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.

"Integrating neuroimaging with studies of cognitive aging in Dominican Republic     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ongoing research in our center in Northern Manhattan has consistently shown that the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia are greater among older Caribbean Hispanics, predominantly from Dominican Republic, than among Caucasians. Despite the consistency of this observation, the causes for this health disparity remain elusive. Individuals from low and middle income countries, such as Dominican Republic, may be at increased risk because of the interacting influences of socioeconomic factors, unique genetic risk factors, and high representation of cerebrovascular disease. The proposed work, in response to PAR-11-031, Brain disorders in the developing world: Research across the lifespan, seeks ultimately to understand the sources of this disparity by building a collaboration with investigators in Santiago, Dominican Republic to integrate high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into ongoing genetic studies of cognitive aging. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to quantify small and large cerebrovascular disease (e.g., infarct, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds) and to examine markers of neurodegeneration (e.g., hippocampus atrophy). The Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica de Alzheimer (EFIGA; NIH R37 AG015473 PI: R. Mayeux) [Family Study of the Genetic Influence of Alzheimer's Disease] is a large scale longitudinal genetic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) comprising individuals with and without AD from families with and without strong histories of the disease; there are over 4,500 active older adult participants, over 2,700 of whom reside in in Santiago. Our proposed pilot study will collect MRI scans in Santiago on 70 active participants from EFIGA and integrate MRI data with clinical and genetic data collected as part of the parent project. We will explore the relationships of markers of cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration with demographic factors, cognitive function/diagnosis, and genetics. We will establish feasibility and pilot data for a prospective, large-scale MRI project of cognitive aging and genetics, carried out in Santiago. As part of the efforts proposed here, we will work towards establishing the local capacity to acquire standardized MRI data and carry out MRI analysis for research involving older adults. Finally, we aim to introduce formal and informal training opportunities on interdisciplinary cognitive aging research via clinical preceptorship, formal didactics, ongoing active collaboration, and a symposium. The proposed project will result in a strong collaboration poised to uncover sources of disparities of cognitive aging among Caribbean Hispanics.          Suboptimal cognitive aging is becoming a true pandemic, particularly in Latin America, where the prevalence of dementia is the highest globally. The proposed project will integrate magnetic resonance imaging into ongoing studies of cognitive aging in Santiago, Dominican Republic, with the ultimate goal of understanding what factors contribute to health disparities in cognitive impairment among Caribbean Hispanics. Integration of neuroimaging into studies of cognitive aging may improve cognitive outcomes in an aging population through the identification of novel and specific treatment targets for intervention and prevention.

"Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline in African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive decline associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common and debilitating conditions, and poses a large and increasing public health problem. Projections indicate that the prevalence of aging-related chronic conditions is expected to increase substantially in the next decade. This will be particularly true for minority populations, especially the older African American population, which is growing at an even more rapid pace than the older White population. The Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) is a longitudinal cohort study of more than 350 older African Americans without dementia who agreed to annual clinical evaluations. During the previous project period we identified several risk factors for cognitive decline in African Americans. The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to quantify three common neuropathologic indices including Alzheimer's disease pathology, cerebral infarctions, and Lewy bodies in MARS participants, and examine their associations to cognitive function and clinical risk factors. In addition, to increase power and examine racial differences in these associations, we propose to use existing longitudinal clinical and neuropathologic data on Whites from two other ongoing cohort studies at Rush. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) examine the association of the three post-mortem neuropathologic indices to 1a: level of global cognition and five cognitive abilities, 1b: change in global cognition and five cognitive abilities; 2) examine racial differences in the associations of neuropathology to level of and change in cognitive function; 3) test the hypothesis that the APOE e4 allele is associated with increased levels of AD pathology, and the 52 allele is associated with a lower level of AD pathology in African Americans; and 4) examine the relationship of BMI to neuropathology, and test the hypothesis that BMI is more strongly associated with AD pathology in Whites than in African Americans. There is limited data on the neuropathologic basis of cognitive impairment in African Americans. Integrating post-mortem indices into a study of risk factors for cognitive decline in one of the fastest growing minority groups is highly innovative and has the potential to greatly increase understanding of the ways in which risk factors interact with neuropathology to influence cognition and racial disparities in cognitive test performance. Further, the findings could have important implications for therapeutic intervention and disease prevention.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine the association of Alzheimer disease pathology and other common neuropathologic indices on risk factors and change in cognitive function over time in older African Americans. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on cognitive function and biological and clinical risk factors of interest from the prior project period and supplement it with quantitative postmortem measurements on more than 100 African Americans. Findings from this study are expected to provide a better understanding of the extent to which neuropathologic indices contribute to cognitive impairment in African Americans, and how pathology may interact with important risk factors to effect racial differences in cognitive function.

"1 of 5 ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.

"New Approaches to Dementia Heterogeneity The new Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has made remarkable progress in just four years, developing new diagnostic approaches to dementia, supporting exciting translational and basic science research and providing training and education at a local and national level. We remain committed to four overarching aims: 1) to explore heterogeneous presentations of dementia in the early stages; 2) to train new basic and translational science leaders in dementia; 3) to educate regarding the non-AD dementias and atypical presentations of AD using conferences and novel web-based approaches; and 4) to bridge the gap between clinical and laboratory studies in dementia by supporting new treatment efforts for AD, FTLD and CJD. With renewal, we will develop better ways to diagnose patients with early FTLD, CBD, PSP, CJD and atypical AD. We will catalyze the development of rational therapies for FTLD with ubiquitin-TDP-43 inclusions, FTLD with tau inclusions, and FTLD associated with progranulin mutations. To generate successful new therapies, we will create effective animal models of disease (Farese project 3) and enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis using our Clinical Core and novel imaging approaches (Seeley project 1). We will involve investigators at the Gladstone Institute such as Lennart Mucke (project 2), Yadong Huang, Li Can, and Robert Mahley in the evaluation of ADRC tissue to bring laboratory findings to the clinic. We will also interact with the CJD drug development program in the Prusiner and DeArmond laboratories by providing well-characterized patients and biosamples. By developing an internet-based approach to education, we will reach tens of thousands of people every year, educating them about dementia, its symptoms, causes and available treatments. We will also host novel and exciting conferences and retreats that generate enthusiasm for our field. To spearhead dementia research, we will continue to attract, train and nurture future leaders in neurodegenerative disease, both in clinical and basic science research. To address the inequalities among aging minority populations, we will develop a unique cohort of Chinese-American patients and integrate this community into our treatment efforts. To understand why some people are able to stave off dementia, we will develop a large healthy aging cohort that will participate in new preventative research efforts. Finally, we will create ideal data management approaches for neurodegenerative conditions that will be shared with other ADRCs, beginning with UC-Davis. The UCSF ADRC enables multidisciplinary investigations of the clinical, imaging, molecular, and pathological features of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and related disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ""healthy aging,"" and promotes the development of novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",New Approaches to Dementia Heterogeneity,8458084,P50AG023501,"['Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathy ', ' Jakob-Creutzfeldt Disease ', ' Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ', ' Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease ', ' CJDs (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) ', ' CJD ', ' Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome ', ' Laboratories ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' San Francisco ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' High Mobility Protein 20 ', ' HMG-20 ', ' ATP-Dependent Proteolysis Factor 1 ', ' APF-1 ', ' Ubiquitin ', ' Universities ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule-associated protein tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule associated protein tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lab Findings ', ' Laboratory Finding ', ' Inequality ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' TDP-43 ', ' protein TDP-43 ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Training and Education ', ' data management ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations ', ' drug development ', ' Commit ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Progranulin ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' healthy aging ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P50,2013,2095739,0.15119808883680796
"Webnovela for Hispanic Dementia Family Caregivers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every 69 seconds someone in US develops Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementia, affecting not only patients, but family caregivers (~15 million), largely untrained and neglected by the healthcare system, with high incidence of stress (60 percent) and depression (33 percent) due to difficulties of caregiving. A large underserved group is Hispanic, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group, facing several health disparities and barriers to care: higher incidence of Alzheimer's (e.g. 63 percent versus 30 percent for Caucasians age 85 years and over); greater depression in Hispanics (45 percent) than in other groups; limited medical insurance; language proficiency issues; lack of knowledge about dementia; greater need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, fewer culturally appropriate interventions, etc Besides materials in Spanish language, culturally appropriate interventions are also needed, because they are more effective, as racial/ethnic identity influences beliefs about dementia and family care giving role, affecting how families cope with dementia care giving and respond to interventions. Another major challenge for effective Hispanic interventions is the retention of participants and adherence to healthcare programs. We propose a new intervention called Webnovela (WN), a short online Telenovela in Spanish, specifically designed for Hispanic caregivers on how to cope with dementia care giving, reduce burden of care, decrease stress, and alleviate depression. A DVD with our Telenovela will also be created for non-Internet users. As Telenovela, a limited-run ""television novel"" drama, is one of the most popular television genres for Hispanics, a ""Telenovela"" intervention is likely to increase the subject retention and intervention adherence. A Webnovela also has a high potential, since Internet is very appealing to Hispanics, with a high number of online Hispanics (30 million in 2010), and growing two times faster than overall US online population. Research on Telenovela-based behavioral interventions is an unexplored field. WN is one of the first (if not the first one for dementia caregivers). The novel WN incorporates: (a) psychoeducation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which are very effective behavioral interventions to reduce stress/depression; (b) translation and adaptation of evidence-based curriculums into a culturally sensitive short Telenovela for Hispanics; and (c) creative use of Telenovela medium to engage and motivate users to follow the intervention. Related clinical advantages are: encourage caregiver participation, enhance intervention adherence, and enable better assimilation of skills; which should enhance caregivers' skills to deal with demanding tasks of care giving, reduce burden of care, improve quality of life, decrease stress, and help to alleviate depression. In partnership with the Alzheimer's Association, expert Advisory Board and caregivers, we will develop and evaluate a prototype in Phase I. We will assess the effectiveness of the complete WN (with all modules) in improving well-being, decreasing stress, and alleviating depression with a randomized clinical trial in Phase II.          Besides affecting 15 million dementia family caregivers in US, who provide 17 billion hours of unpaid care and are at high risk for stress/depression related to the difficulties of dementia care giving (depression rate of 33 percent), Alzheimer's has also a growing impact on Hispanics, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group in US, which is of increasing importance, because the number of Hispanic AD patients is likely to grow at an alarming rate, as the elderly Hispanic population (age 65+) is projected to grow the fastest of all racial/ethnic groups, from about 3 million (2008) to 17 millio (2050). Hispanics also face several health disparities and barriers to care, such as higher incidence of Alzheimer's (e.g. 63 percent for Hispanics vs. 30 percent for Caucasians age 85+), greater depression (45 percent incidence rate among Hispanic caregivers), limited medical insurance, lower educational level, lower household income, higher poverty rate, language proficiency issues, lack of knowledge about dementia, higher need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, and lack of specific tools and culturally appropriate interventios to cope with care giving. After Phase II is completed, the expected outcomes of our project are the following: reduce Hispanic dementia caregiver stress/depression, enhance quality of life, decrease burden of care, and increase coping skills; in addition, we expect the following potential indirect outcomes (not measured by this study): delay institutionalization of dementia patients, reduce caregiver medication, and thereby decrease economic costs.

"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose a large and increasing health and societal burden on the aging US population. New studies suggest that microvascular disease makes a substantial contribution to dementia and MCI. A few long-followed cohorts show strong associations of mid-life hypertension, diabetes, and smoking with dementia at older age in contrast to weak associations in studies of the elderly. An observational study relating dementia, MCI and cerebral changes observable on MRI to midlife vascular risk factors has the promise of suggesting dementia prevention strategies where none currently exist. Aims: The proposed ARIC Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS) will focus on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers through a 5 center R01 ancillary study to the large, bi-ethnic prospective ARIC cohort study. Prediction is expected to be particularly strong in African-Americans and persons whose dementia or MCI is diagnosed as vascular or accompanied by MRI cerebrovascular signs. Aims are to: 1) estimate the prevalence of dementia/MCI by race and sex in participants aged 70-89, 2) determine whether midlife vascular factors (risk factors and markers of macrovascular and microvascular disease) predict dementia, MCI and cognitive change, 3) determine whether the associations between midlife vascular factors and dementia/MCI differ by dementia/MCI subtype defined clinically or by MRI signs, 4) identify cerebral markers associated with cognitive change, including progression of MRI ischemic burden and atrophy across 3 MRI scans spanning 17 years, and 5) identify genomic regions containing susceptibility loci for cognitive decline, using 106 SNPs spanning the genome. Design/Methods: Prospective study of >7000 residents aged 70-89 in 4 US communities adding a 24-year follow-up evaluation with detailed neurocognitive assessment, retinal photography, lab assays and medical record review to 4 previous exams (1987-1999) which included midlife cognitive testing. Two thousand dementia and MCI cases and controls will undergo cerebral MRI with central measurement of cerebrovascular signs and brain volumes. ARIC is uniquely situated for this research since predictors already measured include macrovascular (carotid thickness, plaque and distensibility, peripheral artery disease) and microvascular markers (retinal arteriolar narrowing and nicking, retinal hemorrhage, exudates, and microaneurysms, microalbuminuria), cardiovascular events, hemostatic factors in 5 pathways, apoE, 106 SNPs across the genome, all major cardiovascular risk factors, and in many participants, one or two prior cerebral MRI exams. Implications: Longitudinal observational study of midlife vascular risk factors for cognitive and cerebral changes in the ARIC cohort will elucidate factors underlying ethnic disparities in dementia burden and provide the scientific basis for prevention strategies by identifying vascular therapeutic targets, optimal timing for interventions and useful intermediate outcomes.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ARIC-NCS will provide the means for identifying groups at greater risk for dementia who might benefit from risk factor modification. Its public health relevance is evident given the growing magnitude of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, the realization of a strong association with vascular disease, and the reasonable assumption that the risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment, like strokes, can be substantially reduced by risk factor modification.

"Community-based End-of-life Intervention for African American Dementia Caregivers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End-of-life (EOL) care plans made in advance for relatives with dementia save families anguish in times of medical crises, but less than 13% of African Americans (AAs) have such plans. Yet, they have high morbidity and mortality rates from dementia. A community-based study will examine the efficacy of an education activation (EduAct) intervention for AA family caregiver healthcare proxies (HCPs) to make EOL decisions on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mechanical ventilation (MV), and tube feeding (TF). In a pre/posttest, two condition, repeated measure, randomized design, controlled efficacy trial, HCPs with no EOL care plans will be assigned to either EduAct or attention control groups. We will deliver 9 waves of 4 weekly sessions, a 4-mo booster tailored to residual knowledge deficits. We will enroll 304 AA HCPs (n=152 per group) in 4 urban AA churches randomly assigned to EduAct (n = 2) or control (n = 2) sites, with 8-9 subjects recruited concurrently at each site. The EduAct condition will receive interactive discussions from a nurse facilitator on EOL care planning, dementia, CPR, MV, and TF treatments. The attention control condition receives interactive health-promotion from another nurse facilitator. The Theory of Reasoned Action and Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory frameworks guide both interventions to enhance knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, and behaviors. Questionnaires will be completed pre, immediately post, and 4 mo (booster) for efficacy; evaluations completed at 6 mo, 12 mo, 18 mo, and 24 mo post intervention in both groups to document EOL care when a life threatening medical crisis occurs related to CPR, MV or TF. Lay teachers (n = 8) will be trained to demonstrate feasibility for a community-based model to continue the EduAct program after completion of the study. Specific aims are to: Aim 1. Compare the effect of the EduAct and attention control interventions on HCPs': (a) knowledge (dementia, CPR, MV, TF); (b) self-efficacy about EOL care plans; (c) intentions to write an EOL care plan and (d) behavior (written EOL care plan). Controlling for pretest values and selected covariates, we hypothesize that at all time points the EduAct group will have more: (a) knowledge, (b) self-efficacy, (c) intentions and (d) behaviors (primary outcome) than the control group. Aim 2. Compare the HCPs' immediate posttest written care plan and the care provided within 2 years when any life- threatening medical crisis occurred related to CPR, MV, and TF (exploratory aim). We hypothesize that significantly more EduAct group dementia victims will receive CPR, MV, or TF treatments consistent with the immediate posttest written care plan than the control group. Aim 3. Determine the feasibility of training lay teachers to deliver the EduAct program. Feasibility is defined as retention of lay teachers, fidelity of program delivery, self-efficacy to deliver the program, and intention to deliver future programs. We expect to retain at least 50% of the lay teachers who will deliver it with high fidelity, and report high self-efficacy and intention to delver the program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We developed an education program on dementia, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, tube feeding and mechanical ventilation for family caregivers' of relatives with dementia. The program is designed for caregivers to make the best end of life treatment decisions prior to a medical emergency.

"Epidemiology of Functional Status in Elderly Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging cohorts suffer from informative censoring due to competing risks of death, selective non- mortality attrition, as well as time dependent changes in exposure. Multiple interdependent exposures and outcomes are little studied in relation to health disparities. Death is undeniably a major force shaping patterns of change in risk factors and disease risk in older populations. Increasing interactions of multiple conditions over time complicate analysis. These processes differentially affect race/ethnic health disparities because, among disadvantaged populations, exposures to risk factors typically are higher, start earlier in life, are more sustained and more often under/untreated. Race/ethnic comparisons of risk that do not account for competing risk are likely to incorrectly estimate the impact of treatment or prevention on disease. Mexican Americans have higher prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome at younger ages compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Most older people in this high risk ethnic group have experienced lifelong poverty, low education, and hazardous occupations. As such, compared to non-Hispanic whites, they are at higher risk for stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional impairments and have poorer survival so competing risk of death is likely to be a major issue in analysis. Policy and intervention. Our study has implications for treatment and prevention policies for health and social services. Success in delaying death may mean survivors with more severe disease who are at higher risk for multiple impairments that especially impact disadvantaged Americans. Increases in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes in younger people are projected to lead to future increases in late life impairment The Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging was followed from 1998 to the present. This competing renewal application focuses on analysis of existing data collected annually and semi-annually since 1998 and continuation of 13 years of mortality follow-up for another 3 years. Study Aims are: AIM 1.0.Type 2 diabetes is simultaneously associated with increased risk of cognitive and functional decline, stroke, dementia and death. Statistical methods that account for competing risk of death will produce lower and less biased estimates of these associations than in traditional models.  AIM 2.0.Hypertension is simultaneously associated with the increased risk of cognitive and functional decline, stroke, dementia and death. The association of HTN with nonfatal outcomes is influenced by competing risk (CRisk) of death. Statistical methods that account for competing risk of death will produce lower and less biased estimates of these associations than traditional models provide.  AIM 3.0: Comorbidity is cumulative over time and is simultaneously associated with the multiple outcomes of greater cognitive and functional decline, and dementia and death. Simultaneous joint modeling of time dependent comorbidities with multiple outcomes accounting for informative censoring will provide important information about the underlying syndrome comprised by these conditions and improve statistical efficiency.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the effects of high mortality rates on the association between type 2 diabetes or hypertension on cognitive decline, stroke, dementia and functional impairments in aging Mexican Americans.

"Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline in African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive decline associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common and debilitating conditions, and poses a large and increasing public health problem. Projections indicate that the prevalence of aging-related chronic conditions is expected to increase substantially in the next decade. This will be particularly true for minority populations, especially the older African American population, which is growing at an even more rapid pace than the older White population. The Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) is a longitudinal cohort study of more than 350 older African Americans without dementia who agreed to annual clinical evaluations. During the previous project period we identified several risk factors for cognitive decline in African Americans. The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to quantify three common neuropathologic indices including Alzheimer's disease pathology, cerebral infarctions, and Lewy bodies in MARS participants, and examine their associations to cognitive function and clinical risk factors. In addition, to increase power and examine racial differences in these associations, we propose to use existing longitudinal clinical and neuropathologic data on Whites from two other ongoing cohort studies at Rush. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) examine the association of the three post-mortem neuropathologic indices to 1a: level of global cognition and five cognitive abilities, 1b: change in global cognition and five cognitive abilities; 2) examine racial differences in the associations of neuropathology to level of and change in cognitive function; 3) test the hypothesis that the APOE e4 allele is associated with increased levels of AD pathology, and the 52 allele is associated with a lower level of AD pathology in African Americans; and 4) examine the relationship of BMI to neuropathology, and test the hypothesis that BMI is more strongly associated with AD pathology in Whites than in African Americans. There is limited data on the neuropathologic basis of cognitive impairment in African Americans. Integrating post-mortem indices into a study of risk factors for cognitive decline in one of the fastest growing minority groups is highly innovative and has the potential to greatly increase understanding of the ways in which risk factors interact with neuropathology to influence cognition and racial disparities in cognitive test performance. Further, the findings could have important implications for therapeutic intervention and disease prevention.        This project will examine the association of Alzheimer disease pathology and other common neuropathologic indices on risk factors and change in cognitive function over time in older African Americans. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on cognitive function and biological and clinical risk factors of interest from the prior project period and supplement it with quantitative postmortem measurements on more than 100 African Americans. Findings from this study are expected to provide a better understanding of the extent to which neuropathologic indices contribute to cognitive impairment in African Americans, and how pathology may interact with important risk factors to effect racial differences in cognitive function.

"Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Rural Dwelling Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although more than 20% of the US population live in rural areas, this is an underserved and understudied population. Rural adults suffer disproportionately poorer health and worse health outcomes compared with the rest of the nation. Considerably less research has focused on cognitive health outcomes and their risk factors among older, rural dwelling adults. Among these cognitive changes is mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that affects as many as 19% of older US adults and is widely recognized as a risk state for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias. As such, MCI represents a key target for interventions aimed at the secondary prevention of dementia. We have reason to believe that older, rural adults are especially vulnerable to MCI, based on known higher rates of factors associated with the syndrome. Complicating matters, limited resources and access to care may lead to delayed detection of cognitive changes, making rural adults an especially vulnerable group that is possibly deprived of opportunities for screening and early intervention in the disease process. Based on known rural health disparities, especially later diagnosis of chronic diseases, it is reasonable to hypothesize that MCI may present later in its course in rural adults, but studies describing older, rural dwelling adults with MCI are absent from the literature. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if rural residence is a unique risk factor for delayed detection of MCI. This novel study will examine MCI symptom severity and qualitative description to gain insight into rural cognitive health. The study seeks t advance the science by improving the understanding of MCI in a vulnerable population, which may ultimately direct the development of future health promotion research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poorer health outcomes in older, rural dwelling adults continue to be addressed in the literature, but one condition that is rapidly increasing among older adults, and yet has not been examined in this vulnerable population, is mild cognitive impairment. Mild cognitive impairment is a condition that is widely recognized as a risk state for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias, and therefore, represents a key target for interventions aimed at the secondary prevention of dementia. The proposed research aims to describe cognitive decline in older rural dwelling adults to ultimately inform the development of future interventions or programs to slow disease progression and subsequently reduce dementia incidence in this vulnerable population.            ",Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Rural Dwelling Adults,8783638,F31NR015188,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Attention ', ' Boxing ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Health ', ' Science ', ' Syndrome ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' residence ', ' Rural ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Future Generations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2014,42676,0.050595999577896275
"Epidemiology of Functional Status in Elderly Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging cohorts suffer from informative censoring due to competing risks of death, selective non- mortality attrition, as well as time dependent changes in exposure. Multiple interdependent exposures and outcomes are little studied in relation to health disparities. Death is undeniably a major force shaping patterns of change in risk factors and disease risk in older populations. Increasing interactions of multiple conditions over time complicate analysis. These processes differentially affect race/ethnic health disparities because, among disadvantaged populations, exposures to risk factors typically are higher, start earlier in life, are more sustained and more often under/untreated. Race/ethnic comparisons of risk that do not account for competing risk are likely to incorrectly estimate the impact of treatment or prevention on disease. Mexican Americans have higher prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome at younger ages compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Most older people in this high risk ethnic group have experienced lifelong poverty, low education, and hazardous occupations. As such, compared to non-Hispanic whites, they are at higher risk for stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional impairments and have poorer survival so competing risk of death is likely to be a major issue in analysis. Policy and intervention. Our study has implications for treatment and prevention policies for health and social services. Success in delaying death may mean survivors with more severe disease who are at higher risk for multiple impairments that especially impact disadvantaged Americans. Increases in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes in younger people are projected to lead to future increases in late life impairment The Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging was followed from 1998 to the present. This competing renewal application focuses on analysis of existing data collected annually and semi-annually since 1998 and continuation of 13 years of mortality follow-up for another 3 years. Study Aims are: AIM 1.0.Type 2 diabetes is simultaneously associated with increased risk of cognitive and functional decline, stroke, dementia and death. Statistical methods that account for competing risk of death will produce lower and less biased estimates of these associations than in traditional models.  AIM 2.0.Hypertension is simultaneously associated with the increased risk of cognitive and functional decline, stroke, dementia and death. The association of HTN with nonfatal outcomes is influenced by competing risk (CRisk) of death. Statistical methods that account for competing risk of death will produce lower and less biased estimates of these associations than traditional models provide.  AIM 3.0: Comorbidity is cumulative over time and is simultaneously associated with the multiple outcomes of greater cognitive and functional decline, and dementia and death. Simultaneous joint modeling of time dependent comorbidities with multiple outcomes accounting for informative censoring will provide important information about the underlying syndrome comprised by these conditions and improve statistical efficiency.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the effects of high mortality rates on the association between type 2 diabetes or hypertension on cognitive decline, stroke, dementia and functional impairments in aging Mexican Americans.

"White matter hyperintensities in Aging and Dementia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the elderly population increases, dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an escalating public health threat. Research suggests that there are multiple pathways that lead to the development and expression of AD. Small vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), is common in normal aging and is associated with normal age-related cognitive decline. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that cerebrovascular disease may also play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Work from our laboratory shows that WMH are increased among those at risk for AD; are more severe among patients with AD; and predict the rate of cognitive decline among those with AD. These initial observations strongly indicate that it is essential to demonstrate that longitudinal progression of WMH is related to cognitive decline and incident AD in order to establish causality. The overall aim of this study is to examine how the progression of small vessel vascular disease contributes to cognitive decline and incident AD. This study interfaces with ongoing follow up of the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP; P01 AG07232), a community-based epidemiological study of aging and dementia. Beginning in 2003, MRI scans were acquired on a subset of 717 non-demented elderly participants. The current study seeks to re-evaluate these participants with follow up MRI 6 years after their baseline scans. Advanced MRI analysis techniques will be applied to quantify the degree o f WMH change in major neuroanatomical regions. Cerebral microbleeds, a marker of amyloid angiopathy, will also be quantified to explore their association with WMH. The aims include: 1. To examine the longitudinal change in regional WMH with cognitive decline and incident AD. 2. To examine whether severity and WMH change accounts for ethnic group differences in incident AD. 3. To examine the association of WMH distribution and lobar microbleeds, a putative marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, among patients with AD and controls. Exploratory aims will examine interrelations among WMH, white matter microstructure, hippocampal volume, and cognition. Findings from this study will clarify the role of small vessel vascular disease in the pathogenesis of cognitive aging and AD, will determine if small vessel vascular disease is a source of ethnic group disparities in AD, and will begin to elucidate the mechanism linking vascular disease to AD.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase. This project will identify and characterize vascular factors that may contribute to the development and expression of the disease. It will also identify important factors that may account for ethnic-group disparities in Alzheimer's disease.

"Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease progression; and amyloid- directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD. For ~10 years, the Principal Investigator has conducted studies on the effects of fitness adaptation on cardiovascular (CV) health. Recently, he received 2 years of funding to examine the effects of 3-times/week 6-month aerobic exercise-training on cognition in the laboratory setting. This ongoing study has allowed the Principal Investigator to demonstrate the ability to recruit, enroll, test, collect and manage related neuroimaging pilot data in a predominantly AA sample. While such a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation, such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of cognitive deterioration. To logically extend this ongoing work, he seeks to initiate an 18-month study, testing real-life applicability o the effects of exercise adaptation on memory in a more ideal community setting. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach will bolster retention. The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up) aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. We will test our hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and 2.) stretch-exercise (control). We proposed that the aerobic-exercise group will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, we will determine whether training- induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain volume. Explanatorily, we will also investigate intervention effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1α) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition. A team of experienced investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations supported by DCOA), we will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the aerobic-exercise group will follow a  prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using appropriate multivariate methods. While we remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of our ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 8 months) and therefore allow for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures; test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory. Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical, psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia constituting ~2/3 of all late-life cases. Based on 2011 estimates, the annual health care cost for dementia is ~$183 billion. Given this staggering cost, and the projected increase in elderly population by the year 2030, identifying effective mechanisms to ward off structural and functional declines associated with AD is an important public health goal as evidenced by recent presidential initiatives (reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for, persons with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease). Unfortunately, this  well-intended public health goal cannot be achieved without an effective dementia preventive strategy. Fortunately, lifestyle-induced preservation of intellectual dexterity among those showing earliest symptoms of cognitive deterioration may ameliorate the physical, emotional, and economic burden associated with loss of cognitive vitality. If proven and properly directed in African Americans, such intervention can further reduce health disparity.","Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach",8644082,R01AG045058,"['Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' ApoE ', ' Apo-E ', ' APOE [{C0003595}] ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' Boxing ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Anticholinesterases ', ' Anticholinesterase Drugs ', ' Anticholinesterase Agents ', ' Anti-Cholinesterases ', ' Cholinesterase Inhibitors ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Community-Based Early Identification of MCI in at Risk African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community-dwelling, African-American elders show faster rates of cognitive decline than elderly white Americans and are almost twice as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in the early stages of these disorders, African-American elders are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment. Such health disparities represent a critical roadblock to early identification and care for MCI and dementia, which not only diminishes the medical and social benefits to the individual patient and family, but also fiscal savings at the state and federal levels. Development of economically viable and culturally acceptable methods of early detection of cognitive change is critical in minority populations.  With the increase in longevity and the rapid increase in the proportion of elderly in the population, it is important to evaluate the earliest risk for dementia more accurately in order to guide environmental and clinical interventions for older adults. MCI, characterized by cognitive difficulties without clear functional impairment, is a daily-life-limitig condition that in most cases is a precursor to AD. Access to well characterized elderly who are at risk for MCI (e.g., memory complaint, but otherwise healthy) provides a unique opportunity to study the earliest signs of accelerated cognitive decline in individuals at highest risk for developing dementia.  The proposed cross-sectional study will test to what extent computerized cognitive tests and portable electroencephalography (EEG/ERP) methodology can be used to easily, accurately and efficiently identify early cognitive decline and MCI in elderly African-Americans within their community setting. Additionally, we will also evaluate feasibility and acceptability of these computer-based and electrophysiological methods.  We propose to accomplish the above aims by recruiting a total of 200 at risk African Americans (age e 65 years) from among the 1,100 participants in the Healthier Black Elders Center (HBEC) in their communities within the Detroit metro area. We will use an MCI-enriched sampling by recruiting only those older African Americans who in the recent past expressed subjective memory complaints. These 200 at risk elder African Americans will be extensively evaluated with two computerized tests (i.e., CogState and NIH Toolbox), EEG/ERP recordings, and a structured medical/neuropsychological exam and consensus.  Our community based proposal, combining behavioral and EEG/ERP methods, will be used to establish the utility and acceptability of these measures and to potentially generate profiles of at risk healthy, elderly African-Americans, who may, within a short period of time, develop MCI (participants will be longitudinally followed after this project). We predict that a combination of behavioral and EEG/ERP methods will allow development of objective markers that will reliably identify early signs of cognitive decline. Such markers, in addition to identification of significant cognitive decline, may also play a significan role in the recruitment of larger, more diverse populations in order to evaluate the efficiency of new pharmacological approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults at risk for the life limiting illness of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) provide a unique opportunity to characterize the earliest potential signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Health disparities also are apparent with MCI, as community dwelling African American elders have faster rates of cognitive decline and are almost twice as likely to develop MCI or AD than are older white Americans, but are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment in the early stages of these disorders. To develop reasonable, economically viable, and culturally acceptable methods of early detection of healthy elders who may be at risk for the development of MCI or who may go on to develop AD in minority populations, we propose community-based use of computerized cognitive tests and recording of electroencephalographic signals to better characterize MCI in African Americans.            ",Community-Based Early Identification of MCI in at Risk African Americans,8823919,R21AG046637,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Institutes ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Sampling ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' neuropathology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' inpatient service ', ' computerized ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' neuropsychological ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' treatment response ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,201050,0.13585095263279193
"Webnovela for Hispanic Dementia Family Caregivers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every 69 seconds someone in US develops Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementia, affecting not only patients, but family caregivers (~15 million), largely untrained and neglected by the healthcare system, with high incidence of stress (60 percent) and depression (33 percent) due to difficulties of caregiving. A large underserved group is Hispanic, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group, facing several health disparities and barriers to care: higher incidence of Alzheimer's (e.g. 63 percent versus 30 percent for Caucasians age 85 years and over); greater depression in Hispanics (45 percent) than in other groups; limited medical insurance; language proficiency issues; lack of knowledge about dementia; greater need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, fewer culturally appropriate interventions, etc Besides materials in Spanish language, culturally appropriate interventions are also needed, because they are more effective, as racial/ethnic identity influences beliefs about dementia and family care giving role, affecting how families cope with dementia care giving and respond to interventions. Another major challenge for effective Hispanic interventions is the retention of participants and adherence to healthcare programs. We propose a new intervention called Webnovela (WN), a short online Telenovela in Spanish, specifically designed for Hispanic caregivers on how to cope with dementia care giving, reduce burden of care, decrease stress, and alleviate depression. A DVD with our Telenovela will also be created for non-Internet users. As Telenovela, a limited-run ""television novel"" drama, is one of the most popular television genres for Hispanics, a ""Telenovela"" intervention is likely to increase the subject retention and intervention adherence. A Webnovela also has a high potential, since Internet is very appealing to Hispanics, with a high number of online Hispanics (30 million in 2010), and growing two times faster than overall US online population. Research on Telenovela-based behavioral interventions is an unexplored field. WN is one of the first (if not the first one for dementia caregivers). The novel WN incorporates: (a) psychoeducation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which are very effective behavioral interventions to reduce stress/depression; (b) translation and adaptation of evidence-based curriculums into a culturally sensitive short Telenovela for Hispanics; and (c) creative use of Telenovela medium to engage and motivate users to follow the intervention. Related clinical advantages are: encourage caregiver participation, enhance intervention adherence, and enable better assimilation of skills; which should enhance caregivers' skills to deal with demanding tasks of care giving, reduce burden of care, improve quality of life, decrease stress, and help to alleviate depression. In partnership with the Alzheimer's Association, expert Advisory Board and caregivers, we will develop and evaluate a prototype in Phase I. We will assess the effectiveness of the complete WN (with all modules) in improving well-being, decreasing stress, and alleviating depression with a randomized clinical trial in Phase II.          Besides affecting 15 million dementia family caregivers in US, who provide 17 billion hours of unpaid care and are at high risk for stress/depression related to the difficulties of dementia care giving (depression rate of 33 percent), Alzheimer's has also a growing impact on Hispanics, the largest minority (16 percent of US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group in US, which is of increasing importance, because the number of Hispanic AD patients is likely to grow at an alarming rate, as the elderly Hispanic population (age 65+) is projected to grow the fastest of all racial/ethnic groups, from about 3 million (2008) to 17 millio (2050). Hispanics also face several health disparities and barriers to care, such as higher incidence of Alzheimer's (e.g. 63 percent for Hispanics vs. 30 percent for Caucasians age 85+), greater depression (45 percent incidence rate among Hispanic caregivers), limited medical insurance, lower educational level, lower household income, higher poverty rate, language proficiency issues, lack of knowledge about dementia, higher need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, and lack of specific tools and culturally appropriate interventios to cope with care giving. After Phase II is completed, the expected outcomes of our project are the following: reduce Hispanic dementia caregiver stress/depression, enhance quality of life, decrease burden of care, and increase coping skills; in addition, we expect the following potential indirect outcomes (not measured by this study): delay institutionalization of dementia patients, reduce caregiver medication, and thereby decrease economic costs.

"Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline in African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive decline associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common and debilitating conditions, and poses a large and increasing public health problem. Projections indicate that the prevalence of aging-related chronic conditions is expected to increase substantially in the next decade. This will be particularly true for minority populations, especially the older African American population, which is growing at an even more rapid pace than the older White population. The Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) is a longitudinal cohort study of more than 350 older African Americans without dementia who agreed to annual clinical evaluations. During the previous project period we identified several risk factors for cognitive decline in African Americans. The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to quantify three common neuropathologic indices including Alzheimer's disease pathology, cerebral infarctions, and Lewy bodies in MARS participants, and examine their associations to cognitive function and clinical risk factors. In addition, to increase power and examine racial differences in these associations, we propose to use existing longitudinal clinical and neuropathologic data on Whites from two other ongoing cohort studies at Rush. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) examine the association of the three post-mortem neuropathologic indices to 1a: level of global cognition and five cognitive abilities, 1b: change in global cognition and five cognitive abilities; 2) examine racial differences in the associations of neuropathology to level of and change in cognitive function; 3) test the hypothesis that the APOE e4 allele is associated with increased levels of AD pathology, and the 52 allele is associated with a lower level of AD pathology in African Americans; and 4) examine the relationship of BMI to neuropathology, and test the hypothesis that BMI is more strongly associated with AD pathology in Whites than in African Americans. There is limited data on the neuropathologic basis of cognitive impairment in African Americans. Integrating post-mortem indices into a study of risk factors for cognitive decline in one of the fastest growing minority groups is highly innovative and has the potential to greatly increase understanding of the ways in which risk factors interact with neuropathology to influence cognition and racial disparities in cognitive test performance. Further, the findings could have important implications for therapeutic intervention and disease prevention. This project will examine the association of Alzheimer disease pathology and other common neuropathologic indices on risk factors and change in cognitive function over time in older African Americans. An important strength of the study is that it will take advantage of the availability of detailed information on cognitive function and biological and clinical risk factors of interest from the prior project period and supplement it with quantitative postmortem measurements on more than 100 African Americans. Findings from this study are expected to provide a better understanding of the extent to which neuropathologic indices contribute to cognitive impairment in African Americans, and how pathology may interact with important risk factors to effect racial differences in cognitive function.",Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline in African-Americans,9120973,R01AG022018,"['Hemoglobin ', ' indexing ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Lewy Bodies ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive function ', ' brain tissue ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' interest ', ' Episodic memory ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neuropathology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' visual spatial ', ' Visuospatial ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' neocortical ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' clinical risk ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' Aging ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' ApoE ', ' Apo-E ', ' APOE [{C0003595}] ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cerebral Infarction ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,535072,0.15546554587925265
"Risk Factors for Stroke and Cognitive Decline in a Tri-Ethnic Region ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke, cognitive impairment and dementia are increasing public health problems with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The National Alzheimer's Project Act and the NIH have recommended more extensive studies on the risk and determinants of dementia in disparities populations. Elucidation of the relationships between traditional and novel vascular risk factors for stroke, dementia, cognitive impairment, and disability is critical to enhance our ability to modify the risk of these conditions. The Northern Manhattan Study consists of a population-based cohort of 3497 stroke-free adults who have been followed annually for a median of 13.9 years. This collaborative prospective cohort study among whites, blacks, and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community is an outstanding resource to address health disparities involving faculty across three institutions (Columbia University, University of Miami, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). The cohort is well characterized and the 1290 subjects among the MRI sub-cohort have had a standardized brain MRI and two neuropsychological assessments over 5 years. The new aims are to determine the relationship between cognitive trajectories and a novel neuro-immune and inflammatory biomarker panel; determine the relationship between brain imaging biomarkers (regional brain volumes, regional white matter lesion burden, hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, small dilated perivascular spaces, dolichoectasia) and cognitive trajectories and dementia; determine the risk and vascular determinants of dementia; characterize the vascular determinants of functional impairment, disability, and quality of life; and assess the relationship between novel risk factors and specific ischemic stroke subtypes. To accomplish these aims, subjects will continue to be followed annually by telephone to ascertain stroke, MI, death and change in cognitive status, and more extensive functional assessments will be collected. A third expanded in-person neuropsychological assessment will be done among the MRI subcohort and a dementia consensus conference will ascertain and classify dementia. Stored plasma at the time of MRI will be used to measure an innovative inflammatory and immune biomarker panel, and new MRI measures will be analyzed on the already collected brain MRIs. The strengths of this prospective cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of novel serum biomarkers and brain imaging biomarkers, and the expanded focus on comprehensive outcomes including cognitive trajectories, dementia, functional impairment, and ischemic stroke subtypes. The results of these studies will be instrumental in the design of intervention programs to prevent stroke and cognitive decline in diverse populations and be a valuable shared data resource.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and dementia are increasing public health problems with a larger impact on blacks and Hispanics. Results from studying new blood and brain imaging factors will be instrumental in proposing interventions to prevent stroke and dementia in minority populations.            ",Risk Factors for

"Community-Based Early Identification of MCI in at Risk African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community-dwelling, African-American elders show faster rates of cognitive decline than elderly white Americans and are almost twice as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in the early stages of these disorders, African-American elders are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment. Such health disparities represent a critical roadblock to early identification and care for MCI and dementia, which not only diminishes the medical and social benefits to the individual patient and family, but also fiscal savings at the state and federal levels. Development of economically viable and culturally acceptable methods of early detection of cognitive change is critical in minority populations.  With the increase in longevity and the rapid increase in the proportion of elderly in the population, it is important to evaluate the earliest risk for dementia more accurately in order to guide environmental and clinical interventions for older adults. MCI, characterized by cognitive difficulties without clear functional impairment, is a daily-life-limitig condition that in most cases is a precursor to AD. Access to well characterized elderly who are at risk for MCI (e.g., memory complaint, but otherwise healthy) provides a unique opportunity to study the earliest signs of accelerated cognitive decline in individuals at highest risk for developing dementia.  The proposed cross-sectional study will test to what extent computerized cognitive tests and portable electroencephalography (EEG/ERP) methodology can be used to easily, accurately and efficiently identify early cognitive decline and MCI in elderly African-Americans within their community setting. Additionally, we will also evaluate feasibility and acceptability of these computer-based and electrophysiological methods.  We propose to accomplish the above aims by recruiting a total of 200 at risk African Americans (age e 65 years) from among the 1,100 participants in the Healthier Black Elders Center (HBEC) in their communities within the Detroit metro area. We will use an MCI-enriched sampling by recruiting only those older African Americans who in the recent past expressed subjective memory complaints. These 200 at risk elder African Americans will be extensively evaluated with two computerized tests (i.e., CogState and NIH Toolbox), EEG/ERP recordings, and a structured medical/neuropsychological exam and consensus.  Our community based proposal, combining behavioral and EEG/ERP methods, will be used to establish the utility and acceptability of these measures and to potentially generate profiles of at risk healthy, elderly African-Americans, who may, within a short period of time, develop MCI (participants will be longitudinally followed after this project). We predict that a combination of behavioral and EEG/ERP methods will allow development of objective markers that will reliably identify early signs of cognitive decline. Such markers, in addition to identification of significant cognitive decline, may also play a significan role in the recruitment of larger, more diverse populations in order to evaluate the efficiency of new pharmacological approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults at risk for the life limiting illness of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) provide a unique opportunity to characterize the earliest potential signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Health disparities also are apparent with MCI, as community dwelling African American elders have faster rates of cognitive decline and are almost twice as likely to develop MCI or AD than are older white Americans, but are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment in the early stages of these disorders. To develop reasonable, economically viable, and culturally acceptable methods of early detection of healthy elders who may be at risk for the development of MCI or who may go on to develop AD in minority populations, we propose community-based use of computerized cognitive tests and recording of electroencephalographic signals to better characterize MCI in African Americans.",Community-Based Early Identification of MCI in at Risk African Americans,8929117,R21AG046637,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Sampling ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' neuropathology ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' inpatient service ', ' computerized ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' neuropsychological ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' treatment response ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ']",NIA,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,212699,0.13585095263279193
"Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease progression; and amyloid- directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD. For ~10 years, the Principal Investigator has conducted studies on the effects of fitness adaptation on cardiovascular (CV) health. Recently, he received 2 years of funding to examine the effects of 3-times/week 6-month aerobic exercise-training on cognition in the laboratory setting. This ongoing study has allowed the Principal Investigator to demonstrate the ability to recruit, enroll, test, collect and manage related neuroimaging pilot data in a predominantly AA sample. While such a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation, such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of cognitive deterioration. To logically extend this ongoing work, he seeks to initiate an 18-month study, testing real-life applicability o the effects of exercise adaptation on memory in a more ideal community setting. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach will bolster retention. The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up) aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. We will test our hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and 2.) stretch-exercise (control). We proposed that the aerobic-exercise group will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, we will determine whether training- induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain volume. Explanatorily, we will also investigate intervention effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1α) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition. A team of experienced investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations supported by DCOA), we will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the aerobic-exercise group will follow a  prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using appropriate multivariate methods. While we remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of our ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 8 months) and therefore allow for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures; test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory. Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical, psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia constituting ~2/3 of all late-life cases. Based on 2011 estimates, the annual health care cost for dementia is ~$183 billion. Given this staggering cost, and the projected increase in elderly population by the year 2030, identifying effective mechanisms to ward off structural and functional declines associated with AD is an important public health goal as evidenced by recent presidential initiatives (reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for, persons with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease). Unfortunately, this  well-intended public health goal cannot be achieved without an effective dementia preventive strategy. Fortunately, lifestyle-induced preservation of intellectual dexterity among those showing earliest symptoms of cognitive deterioration may ameliorate the physical, emotional, and economic burden associated with loss of cognitive vitality. If proven and properly directed in African Americans, such intervention can further reduce health disparity.","Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach",8890725,R01AG045058,"['Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' ApoE ', ' Apo-E ', ' APOE [{C0003595}] ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' Boxing ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Anticholinesterases ', ' Anticholinesterase Drugs ', ' Anticholinesterase Agents ', ' Anti-Cholinesterases ', ' Cholinesterase Inhibitors ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral Vascular Disease in American Indians     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AIs) experience a disproportionately high incidence of cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) relative to non-Indians with twice the stroke rate of the general US population. Neuroimaging techniques have shown CBVD-related brain abnormalities to be associated with disruption of neurpsychological performance. Therapy for post-stroke cognitive impairment has been challenging. Cognitive therapy involves intense, focused, regular mental activity, intellectual stimulation, and behaviora exercises that assist individuals to regain or maintain cognitive function. and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia after brain insult. Interactive Metronome (IM) therapy is a promising form of behavioral therapy for CBVD-related cognitive and motor function. This technology uses operant conditioning of an individual's responses through simple, repetitive motor tasks (e.g., clapping hands, tapping feet) in time with a set beat. Through visual and auditory feedback, IM addresses processing speed, attention, and immediate and delayed memory, all of which can be affected by CBVD. IM therapy can improve quality of life, physical mobility, gait, and CBVD- related cognitive deficits. The ongoing Strong Heart Stroke Study (SHSS) (1R01HL093086-01A1; Dedra Buchwald, PI) is investigating CBVD-related brain abnormalities through MRI scans on 1000 AIs from the original SHS cohort. The proposed study will capitalize on this current SHSS to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to ascertain the effects of a culturally tailored IM intervention on cognition, depression, and quality of life. We ill target SHSS participants with subclinical CVBD defined by impaired cognitive processing speed. We will select a sample of 180 American Indians age 68 to 80 years participating in the SHSS. The specific Aims for this study of older American Indians are as follows: 1) Determine if the culturally-adapted IM intervention can improve cognitive functioning among older AIs with CBVD; and 2) Estimate the impact of IM on health-related quality of life. This study will yield important insights into the relationships among cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and brain abnormalities that can inform treatment efforts as one way to reducing AI CBVD disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will further our knowledge of the relationships among of cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and CBVD-related brain abnormalities providing valuable direction for more effective screening, treatment, and prevention of CBVD-related cognitive impairment. Thus, this study has significant health disparities implications for American Indians who exhibit the highest rates of stroke and related risk factors.            ",Rhythm and Timing Exercises for

"Myelin markers and modifiable risks of vascular aging in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this research project is to address minority health disparities in vascular brain aging and to begin to identify modifiable factors that may contribute to these disparities. Up to half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease are attributable to modifiable risk factors including vascular risks factors like hypertension and diabetes. Research has shown that African Americans are disproportionately affected by vascular risk factors and their negative impact on cognition and brain aging when compared to Caucasian Americans; less is known about how this increased susceptibility to vascular brain aging may be impacted by potentially modifiable environmental or `neighborhood' factors. Shown to contribute to cardiovascular disease and stroke, neighborhood factors including crime rates, availability of healthy and less healthy food may `set the stage' or even `set in motion' a cascade of individual conditions including vascular risk factors that may negatively impact brain outcomes. Thus, new insights may be gained by exploring the impact of neighborhood factors before cardiovascular disease and stroke. In fact, a comprehensive evaluation of individuals with high and low- to-no vascular risk would provide understanding of both the negative and positive impact neighborhood factors may have on brain aging. When combined with innovations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that hold promise in identifying `at risk' brain tissue before overt damage occurs, this study may provide targets for future interventions to reduce minority health disparities associated with vascular brain aging.  This study is a logical extension of the PI's K01, an NIA-funded methods grant focused on comparing traditional and more novel techniques including MRI myelin mapping to characterize `at risk' white matter in individuals with elevated vascular risk. K01 data suggests `at risk' brain tissue is evident within white matter of such individuals as is executive dysfunction and to a greater extent in African Americans. While the K01 includes a small sample of African Americans with elevated vascular risk, it does not include African Americans or Caucasian Americans with low-to-no vascular risk. Furthermore, the K01 is not equipped to answer the question of how neighborhood factors might contribute to this profile of risk (or resiliency for that matter). In this R21, we propose to recruit and perfor novel MRI myelin mapping techniques and cognitive assessments in 25 African American and 25 Caucasian Americans with low-to-no vascular risk to compare to African Americans and Caucasian Americans with elevated vascular risk who are studied as part of the K01. Only with the R21 will we be able to investigate the complex interplay of environmental and biological factors that may impact susceptibility to vascular disease and brain aging in African Americans. By combining a novel and sensitive MRI technique with neighborhood factors, we will be the first to contribute to the larger dialogue regarding future directions for treatment and services involving potentially modifiable neighborhood factors that may reduce minority health disparities in vascular brain aging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research has shown that African Americans are disproportionately affected by high vascular risk and its negative impact on brain aging; less is known about how this risk may be impacted by potentially modifiable environmental or `neighborhood' factors. New insights may be gained by i) exploring the impact of neighborhood factors shown to increase the odds of stroke before stroke occurs, i.e., in individuals with high and low levels of vascular risk and ii) combining this with MRI advances in quantifying `at risk' brain aging. Given that up to half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease are attributable to modifiable causes including vascular risk, identifying `at risk' brain tissue before it is damaged and factors that contribute to both vascular brain aging risk and resilience may better inform interventions to slow or stop the development of cognitive decline and dementia that currently and disproportionately affects African Americans.                ",Myelin markers and modifiable risks of vascular aging in African Americans,8892477,R21AG048176,"['Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cognition ', ' Crime ', ' Demyelinations ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ear ', ' Ear structure ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' Ions ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Myelin ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Rain ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Asses ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Lysis ', ' Cytolysis ', ' FSTL3 ', ' FSRP ', ' FLRG ', ' FSTL3 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' minority health ', ' white matter damage ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' aging brain ', ' stem ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Behavior ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2015,248842,0.0026794497401014077
"Race, Childhood Social Disadvantage, and the Adult Brain: HANDLS BRAINCHILD. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed career development plan is to launch the candidate's independent research career investigating the mechanisms by which racial disparities in exposure to early life social disadvantage (ELSD) promote accelerated subclinical and clinical brain pathology in African Americans (AA) across the life course. There are pronounced AA-White disparities in brain health endpoints including stroke, dementia, and cognitive decline. Recent data suggest that earlier disparities in brain health are also noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Exposure to greater ELSD - characterized by harsher residential and neighborhood environments and lower parental socioeconomic status (SES) - may chart a course towards an accelerated onset of and more severe brain pathology observed in AAs as characterized by multiple MRI-assessed indicators of subclinical brain pathology including lower gray matter (GM) volumes, greater white matter lesion volumes and lesser WM integrity. This application was originally submitted in response to the NIA K01 PAR- 09-136, ""Promoting Careers in Aging and Health Disparities Research"" that sought to delineate social factors that precipitate late life health disparities among minorities and elders from disadvantaged backgrounds. Due to discontinuation of that PAR, the current application is a resubmission to the NIA K01 PA-11-190, Mentored Research Scientist Development Award. This K01 will allow the candidate to extend her prior training on the relation of psychosocial factors to coronary heart disease risk among adolescent and early to midlife AAs by providing training in (1) the life course perspective and accelerated theories of aging, particularly as applied to racial disparities in social disadvantage and health, and (2) the brain and related vasculature, and MRI- indicators of brain pathology including subclinical cerebrovascular disease. The proposed project will be a substudy to the ongoing HANDLS SCAN project - itself an ancillary study to the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study, a 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the NIA Intramural Research Program that assesses health disparities in > 3,500 AA and White adults (ages 30-64 at baseline) living in Baltimore, MD. In up to 400 HANDLS participants, HANDLS SCAN examines the relations of race and adult SES to MRI-indicators of brain pathology that may underlie risk for stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline. In the proposed study, 300 HANDLS SCAN participants will complete measures of ELSD to determine: (1) whether ELSD is related to MRI-indicators of brain pathology predictive of future stroke, cognitive, and functional decline, and whether these associations are more pronounced in AAs than in White adults, and (2) explore potential psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical mediators of these associations. The interdisciplinary training outlined in this application will allow the candidate o carve out a unique and unmatched research program that is desperately warranted by the pronounced prevalence of cerebrovascular and other brain disease in AAs. The interrelations among life course social disadvantage, accelerated aging, and brain health endpoints have been grossly understudied and are crucial to developing appropriate prevention and intervention strategies geared toward reducing and ultimately eliminating race-related health disparities in brain aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pronounced racial disparities are observed across multiple clinical and subclinical brain health endpoints in African Americans compared to Whites and may be attributable, in part, to accelerated age-related disease processes. Great public health relevance lies in our ability to understand the relation of racial disparities in early life social disadvantage to subclinical markers of brain pathology predictive of future clinical endpoints such as stroke, dementia, and cognitive and physical decline in African Americans, and related multi-level mediators of this relation. Such research can facilitate development of appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in multiple brain health endpoints.","Race, Childhood Social Disadvantage, and the Adult Brain: HANDLS BRAINCHILD.",8927517,K01AG043581,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' indexing ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maryland ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Epidemiology of Functional Status in Elderly Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging cohorts suffer from informative censoring due to competing risks of death, selective non- mortality attrition, as well as time dependent changes in exposure. Multiple interdependent exposures and outcomes are little studied in relation to health disparities. Death is undeniably a major force shaping patterns of change in risk factors and disease risk in older populations. Increasing interactions of multiple conditions over time complicate analysis. These processes differentially affect race/ethnic health disparities because, among disadvantaged populations, exposures to risk factors typically are higher, start earlier in life, are more sustained and more often under/untreated. Race/ethnic comparisons of risk that do not account for competing risk are likely to incorrectly estimate the impact of treatment or prevention on disease. Mexican Americans have higher prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome at younger ages compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Most older people in this high risk ethnic group have experienced lifelong poverty, low education, and hazardous occupations. As such, compared to non-Hispanic whites, they are at higher risk for stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional impairments and have poorer survival so competing risk of death is likely to be a major issue in analysis. Policy and intervention. Our study has implications for treatment and prevention policies for health and social services. Success in delaying death may mean survivors with more severe disease who are at higher risk for multiple impairments that especially impact disadvantaged Americans. Increases in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes in younger people are projected to lead to future increases in late life impairment The Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging was followed from 1998 to the present. This competing renewal application focuses on analysis of existing data collected annually and semi-annually since 1998 and continuation of 13 years of mortality follow-up for another 3 years. Study Aims are: AIM 1.0.Type 2 diabetes is simultaneously associated with increased risk of cognitive and functional decline, stroke, dementia and death. Statistical methods that account for competing risk of death will produce lower and less biased estimates of these associations than in traditional models.  AIM 2.0.Hypertension is simultaneously associated with the increased risk of cognitive and functional decline, stroke, dementia and death. The association of HTN with nonfatal outcomes is influenced by competing risk (CRisk) of death. Statistical methods that account for competing risk of death will produce lower and less biased estimates of these associations than traditional models provide.  AIM 3.0: Comorbidity is cumulative over time and is simultaneously associated with the multiple outcomes of greater cognitive and functional decline, and dementia and death. Simultaneous joint modeling of time dependent comorbidities with multiple outcomes accounting for informative censoring will provide important information about the underlying syndrome comprised by these conditions and improve statistical efficiency.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the effects of high mortality rates on the association between type 2 diabetes or hypertension on cognitive decline, stroke, dementia and functional impairments in aging Mexican Americans.

"Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) provides Georgia and the region with comprehensive clinical, research, and educational programs. This renewal application outlines our success in building an environment that encourages and supports innovative projects with a general theme of discovery and translation of new targets and mechanisms to enable early identification, early interventions, and ultimately prevention of AD. Given the well documented disparities in clinical research participation and burden of disease for AD in the African American community, the Emory ADRC focuses special effort to understand and address inter-individual differences in AD, ranging from ethno-racial factors to personal differences in genetic and protein variation. We benefit from generous institutional support from Emory, one of the nation's fastest growing research academic medical centers, the generous Atlanta community, and a highly collaborative team from more than 20 departments and centers. Five Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology, and Outreach Recruitment and Education), coordinate activities to effectively recruit, evaluate, and engage a diverse cohort of volunteers who actively participate in a wide variety of research studies that aim to better define the trajectory from normal cognitive aging to symptomatic stages of disease. Data from the Cores are captured and stored for distribution to local researchers and for national collaborations. Our biospecimen banks include well-characterized neuropathological case materials, blood and CSF, and DNA. These valuable resources are distributed widely for a variety of approved studies of genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and pathological investigations. The ADRC educational programs reach a broad audience of students, health care professionals, and the public. Three cutting edge research projects are closely integrated with ADRC Cores: Project 1, AD Biomarkers and Endothelial Dysfunction in Caucasians and African Americans, is a longitudinal biomarker study with full integration into the ADRC Clinical Core and OREC, leveraging a unique community based Registry for Remembrance to facilitate recruitment of African Americans; Project 2, A Proteogenomic Approach to Understanding AD GWAS Results, proposes to use state-of-the art targeted gene resequencing and mass spectrometer-based protein sequencing to advance understanding of genetic risk of AD by genetic loci by linking novel gene variants at 20+ recently identified loci directly with the encoded and expressed protein variants in AD brain in an allele specific manner; Project 3, Defining the Properties of Pathogenic Aβ strains in Alzheimer's Disease, takes an interdisciplinary approach to build on pioneering work showing AD brain extracts are transmissible in animal models, by investigating how structural differences in Aβ strains from asymptomatic vs. symptomatic stages of AD vary in their seeding and propagation in yeast and animal models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Emory ADRC has grown dramatically during the past funding cycles (years 6-10), and now seeks a 3rd renewal (years 11-15). The ADRC contributes to the NIH/NIA-funded network and plays a critical role in the coordinated response to the growing public health threat from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emory's active participation in the network fosters research to understand the causes, investigate novel targets and interventions that will lead to more effective treatments and prevention, and improve the treatment of affected individuals with AD and related conditions, and the well being of their family caregivers.",Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center,8849137,P50AG025688,"['University Medical

"Community-based End-of-life Intervention for African American Dementia Caregivers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End-of-life (EOL) care plans made in advance for relatives with dementia save families anguish in times of medical crises, but less than 13% of African Americans (AAs) have such plans. Yet, they have high morbidity and mortality rates from dementia. A community-based study will examine the efficacy of an education activation (EduAct) intervention for AA family caregiver healthcare proxies (HCPs) to make EOL decisions on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mechanical ventilation (MV), and tube feeding (TF). In a pre/posttest, two condition, repeated measure, randomized design, controlled efficacy trial, HCPs with no EOL care plans will be assigned to either EduAct or attention control groups. We will deliver 9 waves of 4 weekly sessions, a 4-mo booster tailored to residual knowledge deficits. We will enroll 304 AA HCPs (n=152 per group) in 4 urban AA churches randomly assigned to EduAct (n = 2) or control (n = 2) sites, with 8-9 subjects recruited concurrently at each site. The EduAct condition will receive interactive discussions from a nurse facilitator on EOL care planning, dementia, CPR, MV, and TF treatments. The attention control condition receives interactive health-promotion from another nurse facilitator. The Theory of Reasoned Action and Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory frameworks guide both interventions to enhance knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, and behaviors. Questionnaires will be completed pre, immediately post, and 4 mo (booster) for efficacy; evaluations completed at 6 mo, 12 mo, 18 mo, and 24 mo post intervention in both groups to document EOL care when a life threatening medical crisis occurs related to CPR, MV or TF. Lay teachers (n = 8) will be trained to demonstrate feasibility for a community-based model to continue the EduAct program after completion of the study. Specific aims are to: Aim 1. Compare the effect of the EduAct and attention control interventions on HCPs': (a) knowledge (dementia, CPR, MV, TF); (b) self-efficacy about EOL care plans; (c) intentions to write an EOL care plan and (d) behavior (written EOL care plan). Controlling for pretest values and selected covariates, we hypothesize that at all time points the EduAct group will have more: (a) knowledge, (b) self-efficacy, (c) intentions and (d) behaviors (primary outcome) than the control group. Aim 2. Compare the HCPs' immediate posttest written care plan and the care provided within 2 years when any life- threatening medical crisis occurred related to CPR, MV, and TF (exploratory aim). We hypothesize that significantly more EduAct group dementia victims will receive CPR, MV, or TF treatments consistent with the immediate posttest written care plan than the control group. Aim 3. Determine the feasibility of training lay teachers to deliver the EduAct program. Feasibility is defined as retention of lay teachers, fidelity of program delivery, self-efficacy to deliver the program, and intention to deliver future programs. We expect to retain at least 50% of the lay teachers who will deliver it with high fidelity, and report high self-efficacy and intention to delver the program.

"Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Rural Dwelling Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although more than 20% of the US population live in rural areas, this is an underserved and understudied population. Rural adults suffer disproportionately poorer health and worse health outcomes compared with the rest of the nation. Considerably less research has focused on cognitive health outcomes and their risk factors among older, rural dwelling adults. Among these cognitive changes is mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that affects as many as 19% of older US adults and is widely recognized as a risk state for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias. As such, MCI represents a key target for interventions aimed at the secondary prevention of dementia. We have reason to believe that older, rural adults are especially vulnerable to MCI, based on known higher rates of factors associated with the syndrome. Complicating matters, limited resources and access to care may lead to delayed detection of cognitive changes, making rural adults an especially vulnerable group that is possibly deprived of opportunities for screening and early intervention in the disease process. Based on known rural health disparities, especially later diagnosis of chronic diseases, it is reasonable to hypothesize that MCI may present later in its course in rural adults, but studies describing older, rural dwelling adults with MCI are absent from the literature. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if rural residence is a unique risk factor for delayed detection of MCI. This novel study will examine MCI symptom severity and qualitative description to gain insight into rural cognitive health. The study seeks t advance the science by improving the understanding of MCI in a vulnerable population, which may ultimately direct the development of future health promotion research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poorer health outcomes in older, rural dwelling adults continue to be addressed in the literature, but one condition that is rapidly increasing among older adults, and yet has not been examined in this vulnerable population, is mild cognitive impairment. Mild cognitive impairment is a condition that is widely recognized as a risk state for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias, and therefore, represents a key target for interventions aimed at the secondary prevention of dementia. The proposed research aims to describe cognitive decline in older rural dwelling adults to ultimately inform the development of future interventions or programs to slow disease progression and subsequently reduce dementia incidence in this vulnerable population.            ",Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Rural Dwelling Adults,8926706,F31NR015188,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Attention ', ' Boxing ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Health ', ' Science ', ' Syndrome ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' residence ', ' Rural ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Future Generations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2015,43120,0.050595999577896275
"Relation of estrogen pathway genes to cognitive decline in elderly women and men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will provide additional education and training for Dr. Sarah Janicki to establish herself as a clinical translational scientist in the hormonal mediators of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). An integrated multidisciplinary didactic and practical training program has been developed to allow Dr. Janicki to accomplish the following goals: 1) extend her training in advanced methods in the genetic epidemiology of aging; 2) learn and use longitudinal data analytic techniques; 3) develop expertise in neuromorphometric analytic techniques of structural MRI data; 4) transition to an independent career as a clinical translational scientist. Dr. Janicki's training program is supported by committed and enthusiastic mentorship from a panel of renowned experts in the genetics, epidemiology, cognitive assessment and neuroimaging of AD, and benefits from an outstanding intellectual environment, opportunities for career growth, and substantial institutional commitment. The objectives of the proposed research plan are to determine the contribution of estrogen biosynthetic pathway gene variants to cognitive decline, and to employ neuroimaging analyses to determine the underlying neurobiological pathways through which polymorphisms in these genes affect cognitive decline in elderly men and women of different ethnicities. Investigations in the neuropathology, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological studies of AD suggest that it is an estrogen-sensitive disease. Many prior studies evaluating the effect of estrogen on cognitive decline and brain morphology in the elderly have used study populations receiving exogenous estrogen supplementation, since age-related declines in endogenous hormones do not allow accurate assessment of estrogen status. However, hormone replacement therapy may have different effects on brain morphology than does lifelong hormone exposure due to composition and administration late in life. This study uses variants in genes of known estrogen receptor and biosynthetic function (ESR1, ESR2, CYP17, CYP19, and HSD17B1) as instrumental variables to estimate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on changes in neuropsychological cognitive assessments and structural brain outcomes. The study population includes elderly men and women from the Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP) and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Confirmatory analyses of significant findings will be performed in the Rotterdam Study (RS). Exploratory aims will examine how the effects of estrogen SNPs may vary by ethnicity due to socioeconomic and cerebrovascular risk factors associated with risk for cognitive decline. This study will lay the groundwork for future R01 grant applications identifying mechanisms of hormone action that direct areas of intervention in AD. This application directly supports the National Institute on Aging's proposed mission to conduct genetic and biological research related to diseases associated with aging, its objective to understand health differences and inequities associated with race, ethnicity, and gender among older adults, and its stated commitment to foster the development of clinician scientists in aging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to determine the contribution of estrogen and testosterone gene variants to cognitive decline, and to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses to determine the underlying pathways through which variants in these genes affect cognitive decline in elderly men and women. The exploratory aims of this study evaluate whether the mechanisms by which estrogen gene variants affect cognitive decline vary by ethnicity. Examining how estrogen pathway gene variants influence brain morphology and specifically contribute to cognitive decline in both elderly men and women of different ethnicities will improve understanding of how development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is affected by hormones, and will guide the design of more appropriate gender-based treatments for AD in the future.

"A Culturally-Relevant Approach to Reducing Dementia Caregiver Stress in an Underserved Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans currently are the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S., thus, the number of Asian Americans with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers will also increase. Surprisingly, very little intervention work has focused on addressing caregiver needs in this population. Specifically, a large gap exists in the development of interventions to reduce caregiver stress and little is known about how cultural diversity impacts caregiver stress and intervention outcomes. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will give Dr. Meyer the skills, training, and mentoring necessary to conduct community-engaged interventions to reduce the burden of AD in culturally diverse family caregivers. The proposed mentored research activities for this K01 award are to refine and pilot test a theoretically-informed, culturally-relevant, community-based intervention informed by sociocultural stress and coping and social contextual models to reduce distress and enhance well-being in Vietnamese American dementia caregivers. By focusing on this large and underserved population, this K01 application is consistent with NIA Research Goal E: Improve our ability to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults. It als responds to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) to involve more racially/ethnically diverse older adults in research and to develop effective services to support ethnically diverse families. This application includes experiential and research activities in three critical areas fo Dr. Meyer's career development: (1) knowledge of AD and associated dementias (e.g., risk factors, assessment and diagnosis, course) and cognitive impairment and how they affect families, (2) methodological skills and cultural knowledge to conduct community-engaged intervention research, including formal training in aspects of community-based participatory research (e.g. mixed methods) and enhanced knowledge of Vietnamese culture and language, and (3) theoretical and methodological skills necessary to design, implement, and analyze scientifically rigorous interventions for culturally diverse populations (e.g., design issues, longitudinal data analysis). Mentored research training will occur in the context of a focused research project with two aims: (1) Refine and manualize a culturally- informed intervention to reduce distress and enhance well-being in Vietnamese dementia caregivers, and (2) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Completion of the proposed research and career development activities will generate data to inform the development of an R34 or R21 application and provide Dr. Meyer with the experience necessary to transition from observational/ descriptive to community-based intervention work. Dr. Meyer will leverage existing resources and expertise at three NIH-funded centers at UC Davis: the Alzheimer's disease Center, the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, and the Clinical and Translational Science Center. These resources, along with the mentoring team's strong, collaborative relationships with local community-based organizations will provide an enriched environment that will help Dr. Meyer to be a successful and independent investigator.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the number of Asian Americans rapidly grows, so too will the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers. Caregivers of persons with AD suffer a substantial burden emotionally, physically, and financially, and this may be especially true for immigrant and underserved Asians. The development of psychosocial interventions that address the diversity and complexity of caregiver distress in culturally diverse populations is a critical public health challenge.        ",A

"Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive reserve refers to the ability to buffer against brain pathology, including types commonly found post mortem in the brains of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). I hypothesize that reserve is a key reason why some older adults have normal cognitive function despite the presence of neuropathology. Recently, researchers have begun to empirically investigate reserve as the discrepancy between neuropathology and brain function, as measured with cognitive tests. Studies have found a relationship between a disadvantaged early life environment and later life clinical dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. However, it is not known if an advantaged early life is related to greater later life reserve or lower levels of neuropathology itself. As brain development is particularly accelerated through age 5 years, early life could be a sensitive period for cognitive reserve. I propose to use four unique datasets that contain information on early life social environment, later life cognitive tests, and autopsy-based neuropathology measures from geographically diverse study populations: the Adult Changes in Thought Study, the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, the Religious Orders Study, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. I test the hypotheses that an advantaged early life environment, independently of and synergistically with adult social advantage, is related to greater later life cognitive reserve, even in the presence of significant neuropathology. I will be able to test also whether early life environment is related to actual levels of cognition and neuropathology. My background in demography and epidemiology, including 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow and 5 years as a junior faculty member, prepares me to lead these projects, under the guidance of a team that reflects the leadership of the proposed studies, local experts in neuropathology and epidemiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, a local expert in the analysis of cognitive measures, and a leading expert in the integration of social and life course epidemiology. The proposed training and research experiences in this project will be integral in building a foundation in the analysis of cognitive outcomes and resilience to dementia, and enhancing the experience of my existing skills in life course and aging epidemiology that will allow me to lead future projects at the intersection of these fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project identifies whether an advantaged early social environment increases one's later life cognitive reserve, that is, the ability to buffer from pathology. I measure an advantaged early social environment primarily through early life family socioeconomic position and height and also test to what extent an advantaged adult social environment explains this relationship, versus the link from early life to later life cognitive reserve.","Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve",9109337,K01AG050723,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Asia ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Baltimore ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Buffers ', ' Clergy ', ' Cognition ', ' Demography ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Japanese American ', ' Knee ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Experience ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' Memory ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' nutritional care ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' news ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Height ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social inequality ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' population based ', ' early life exposure ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' study population ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2016,120657,0.11199385342020583
"Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease progression; and amyloid- directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD. For ~10 years, the Principal Investigator has conducted studies on the effects of fitness adaptation on cardiovascular (CV) health. Recently, he received 2 years of funding to examine the effects of 3-times/week 6-month aerobic exercise-training on cognition in the laboratory setting. This ongoing study has allowed the Principal Investigator to demonstrate the ability to recruit, enroll, test, collect and manage related neuroimaging pilot data in a predominantly AA sample. While such a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation, such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of cognitive deterioration. To logically extend this ongoing work, he seeks to initiate an 18-month study, testing real-life applicability o the effects of exercise adaptation on memory in a more ideal community setting. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach will bolster retention. The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up) aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. We will test our hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and 2.) stretch-exercise (control). We proposed that the aerobic-exercise group will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, we will determine whether training- induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain volume. Explanatorily, we will also investigate intervention effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1α) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition. A team of experienced investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations supported by DCOA), we will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the aerobic-exercise group will follow a  prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using appropriate multivariate methods. While we remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of our ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 8 months) and therefore allow for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures; test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory. Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical, psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia constituting ~2/3 of all late-life cases. Based on 2011 estimates, the annual health care cost for dementia is ~$183 billion. Given this staggering cost, and the projected increase in elderly population by the year 2030, identifying effective mechanisms to ward off structural and functional declines associated with AD is an important public health goal as evidenced by recent presidential initiatives (reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for, persons with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease). Unfortunately, this  well-intended public health goal cannot be achieved without an effective dementia preventive strategy. Fortunately, lifestyle-induced preservation of intellectual dexterity among those showing earliest symptoms of cognitive deterioration may ameliorate the physical, emotional, and economic burden associated with loss of cognitive vitality. If proven and properly directed in African Americans, such intervention can further reduce health disparity.","Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach",9066061,R01AG045058,"['Aerobic fitness ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' ApoE ', ' Apo-E ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' Boxing ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cerebral Tissue Hypoxia ', ' Cerebral Hypoxia ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Anticholinesterases ', ' Anticholinesterase Drugs ', ' Anticholinesterase Agents ', ' Anti-Cholinesterases ', ' Cholinesterase Inhibitors ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Myelin markers and modifiable risks of vascular aging in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this research project is to address minority health disparities in vascular brain aging and to begin to identify modifiable factors that may contribute to these disparities. Up to half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease are attributable to modifiable risk factors including vascular risks factors like hypertension and diabetes. Research has shown that African Americans are disproportionately affected by vascular risk factors and their negative impact on cognition and brain aging when compared to Caucasian Americans; less is known about how this increased susceptibility to vascular brain aging may be impacted by potentially modifiable environmental or `neighborhood' factors. Shown to contribute to cardiovascular disease and stroke, neighborhood factors including crime rates, availability of healthy and less healthy food may `set the stage' or even `set in motion' a cascade of individual conditions including vascular risk factors that may negatively impact brain outcomes. Thus, new insights may be gained by exploring the impact of neighborhood factors before cardiovascular disease and stroke. In fact, a comprehensive evaluation of individuals with high and low- to-no vascular risk would provide understanding of both the negative and positive impact neighborhood factors may have on brain aging. When combined with innovations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that hold promise in identifying `at risk' brain tissue before overt damage occurs, this study may provide targets for future interventions to reduce minority health disparities associated with vascular brain aging.  This study is a logical extension of the PI's K01, an NIA-funded methods grant focused on comparing traditional and more novel techniques including MRI myelin mapping to characterize `at risk' white matter in individuals with elevated vascular risk. K01 data suggests `at risk' brain tissue is evident within white matter of such individuals as is executive dysfunction and to a greater extent in African Americans. While the K01 includes a small sample of African Americans with elevated vascular risk, it does not include African Americans or Caucasian Americans with low-to-no vascular risk. Furthermore, the K01 is not equipped to answer the question of how neighborhood factors might contribute to this profile of risk (or resiliency for that matter). In this R21, we propose to recruit and perfor novel MRI myelin mapping techniques and cognitive assessments in 25 African American and 25 Caucasian Americans with low-to-no vascular risk to compare to African Americans and Caucasian Americans with elevated vascular risk who are studied as part of the K01. Only with the R21 will we be able to investigate the complex interplay of environmental and biological factors that may impact susceptibility to vascular disease and brain aging in African Americans. By combining a novel and sensitive MRI technique with neighborhood factors, we will be the first to contribute to the larger dialogue regarding future directions for treatment and services involving potentially modifiable neighborhood factors that may reduce minority health disparities in vascular brain aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research has shown that African Americans are disproportionately affected by high vascular risk and its negative impact on brain aging; less is known about how this risk may be impacted by potentially modifiable environmental or `neighborhood' factors. New insights may be gained by i) exploring the impact of neighborhood factors shown to increase the odds of stroke before stroke occurs, i.e., in individuals with high and low levels of vascular risk and ii) combining this with MRI advances in quantifying `at risk' brain aging. Given that up to half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease are attributable to modifiable causes including vascular risk, identifying `at risk' brain tissue before it is damaged and factors that contribute to both vascular brain aging risk and resilience may better inform interventions to slow or stop the development of cognitive decline and dementia that currently and disproportionately affects African Americans.",Myelin markers and modifiable risks of vascular aging in African Americans,9131609,R21AG048176,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Cognition ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Crime ', ' Demyelinations ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Myelin ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' minority health ', ' white matter damage ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' modifiable risk ', ' brain behavior ', ' aging brain ', ' stem ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Executive Dysfunction ', ' Executive Impairment ', ' Executive Function Deficit ', ' prehypertension ', ' pre-hypertension ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2016,32566,0.0026794497401014077

"A non-pharmacological intervention for patients with Alzheimer s disease and family caregivers Abstract An increasing number of adults in the U.S. provide care to someone aged 50+ years with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alzheimer's disease is a devastating illness affecting patients, family members and society. There is a need to identify interventions that decrease the cognitive and functional manifestations of the condition in the patient and the negative consequences experienced by family caregivers. Evidence suggests that non- pharmacological intervention approaches can be beneficial to both caregivers and AD patients. However, most intervention programs have exclusively focused on the caregiver or the patient, despite emerging evidence of a reciprocal interaction between the dyad. Also, most caregiver programs have targeted caregivers of patients in the moderate to severe stages of the illness. In addition, cognitive interventions for individuals with AD have been dependent on facility based training approaches, which limit feasibility and cost effectiveness.  The proposed study will develop and test the efficacy and feasibility of a dyadic-based intervention program (DT), delivered through state-of-the art computer tablet technology. A novel feature of the investigation is its focus on both the caregiver and the recipient of care (person with AD) and the integration of an evidenced- based caregiver intervention and evidenced-based cognitive/functional training for the care recipient. The program will be tailored for the caregiver and emphasize issues important to caregivers, not only in the earlier stages of caregiving, but will also target issues across the caregiving trajectory to help prepare the caregiver for changes in their role. The cognitive/functional training will be targeted to the needs of the care recipient. The DT intervention will be 6 months in duration and compared to a control condition (CC) that combines standard a nutrition intervention for the caregiver and mental stimulation exercises for care recipient. Two hundred and forty Hispanic, African American and White/Caucasian dyads will be randomized to the DT intervention or CC condition. Measures at baseline and the 6 and 12-month follow-ups will include indices of care recipient cognitive and functional status, and caregiver outcomes such as; quality of life, distress, and caregiving efficacy. Information will also be gathered on ethnic differences in response to the intervention and estimates of cost effectiveness of the intervention. The DT intervention is highly innovative given the focus on a dyadic approach, the use of state-of-the-art technology for intervention delivery, a community-based and stage-model approach to intervention development, the inclusion of the caregiver as a therapy extender and cultural tailoring of the program. Narrative The proposed study is extremely relevant to public health concerns. The prevalence of individuals with AD and family caregivers is projected to increase in the upcoming decades. To address this pressing issue, the focus of the proposed study is to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of an innovative intervention program, delivered through state-of-the art computer tablet technology that targets both ethnically/culturally diverse family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD patients. The program augments an evidenced-based caregiver intervention with an evidenced-based cognitive/functional training intervention for the patient. The overall goals of the project are to improve the lives of family caregivers; the ability of caregivers to provide care to their loved ones; to improve the lives of individuals with AD; and to reduce disparities in access to needed services and support among caregiver and patient populations.",A non-pharmacological intervention for patients with Alzheimer s disease and family caregivers,9194144,R01AG054009,"['Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' cognitive training ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' loved ones ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' abstracting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Maintenance ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,749437,0.10554868491582454

"Racial Differences in Late-Life Cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive decline in our aging population is a major public health priority. The older Black population is growing at a rapid pace and a significant body of evidence suggests that they suffer a greater burden of cognitive impairment and dementia compared to older Whites. Studies which collect brain tissue from well-characterized older Blacks with sufficient cognitive follow-up and risk factors are crucial to advance our understanding of the pathologic substrates underlying AD in older Blacks. In prior funding periods, the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) made considerable progress identifying risk factors for cognitive decline in older Blacks. We enrolled a large cohort of well-characterized persons, followed them annually, and reported social, psychological, and medical risk factors related to cognitive decline, many of which appear to increase the burden of impairment compared with Whites. We also obtained autopsy from a subsample of participants who agreed to brain donation. The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to address gaps in the understanding of racial differences in the relation of risk factors and the pathologic substrates of incident AD and late-life cognitive decline. Leveraging ten years of data collection on risk factors, cognitive and motor function, a unique source of brain tissue, and donated data on Whites from ongoing studies at Rush, we propose to continue collecting clinical and postmortem data on MARS participants, test whether motor function may serve as a new biomarker for AD, and quantify new histopathologic and postmortem brain MRI indices to measure the impact of cerebrovascular pathologies in Blacks who come to autopsy. Aim 1 will examine racial differences in the association of demographic, lifestyle, and motor risk factors with incident AD. Aim 2 will examine nonlinear change in cognition and test hypotheses regarding racial differences in the effects of risk factors on changes in slope before and after incident AD. Aim 3 will evaluate racial differences in change in mobility and the associations of mobility with incident AD. Finally, Aim 4 will obtain more extensive data on cerebrovascular disease pathologies and postmortem brain MRI indices to determine the relation of brain indices to cognitive and motor function in Blacks, and compare the burden of cerebrovascular pathologies in Blacks and Whites. The proposed study provides a unique opportunity to answer critical questions about a large understudied segment of our aging society.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will integrate postmortem brain examination into an ongoing cohort study of risk factors for AD in older Blacks and compare them to matched Whites to identify racial differences in the pathologic substrates of AD. These data are critical t reduce disparities and the burden of AD and cognitive decline in a rapidly growing and understudied population.        ",Racial Differences in Late-Life Cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's Disease,9105062,RF1AG022018,"['Acceleration ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' indexing ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' motor disease ', ' motor disorder ', ' disability ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' TDP-43 ', ' protein TDP-43 ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' brain tissue ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Pathologic ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RF1,2016,5573118,0.15793260196573897
"Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Due to Ambulance Diversion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2007, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) characterized ambulance diversion (AD), the practice by which Emergency Departments (EDs) are temporarily closed, as ""antithetical to quality medical care"" and called for its ""elimination"". Nevertheless, A persists, with 45% of EDs and 70% of urban EDs reporting AD in the last published survey in 2003. AD has been associated with higher mortality, delayed treatment, and other adverse outcomes. Not examined hitherto, AD has the potential to exacerbate disparities by race/ethnicity and income. AD may also increase healthcare costs. However, the current literature on the impact of AD is based on data from convenience sampling and is limited by a dearth of experimental evidence. On 1/1/2009, Massachusetts became the first, and to date only, state to ban AD. Treating the state-imposed ban as a natural experiment, we propose to estimate the causal impact of AD on access, outcomes, and cost, focusing on the potentially differential effects by race/ethnicity and income.  To better understand ambulance use and AD within the milieu of overall patient care, we will develop a national longitudinal database of ambulance use based on Medicare administrative data. Using longitudinal patient records, this data will be better suited to examine the determinants of ambulance use, outcomes, and the impact of AD across diverse patients.  We will focus on older adults with a chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary condition. We will identify a national cohort of a stratified random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 or older (N=1,000,000), with an oversample from Massachusetts, and obtain data on all healthcare utilization, including ambulance and ED visits, from 2006-2012. Given the primacy of residential location in examining ambulance and ED use, this sample will be stratified by race/ethnicity and residence zip code to enable comparison of diverse patients from the same area. For the subset of Boston residents (Boston cohort) we will merge data from the Boston Emergency Medical Services (EMS) from 2006-2012 for EMS-specific outcome measures. Our specific aims are to evaluate: (1) incidence of ambulance use and reliance, (2) differences by race/ethnicity and income in ambulance transport outcomes, and (3) impact of Massachusetts AD ban on outcomes of ambulance transport and other ED patients not transported by ambulance.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has highlighted the ""limited"" research and knowledge base of EMS practices. Using novel data with national scope, this study will make significant contributions to this evidence base and inform public policy on AD regarding not only its impact on clinical outcomes, but also, its impact on disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine (IOM) characterized ambulance diversion (AD), the practice by which Emergency Departments (EDs) are temporarily closed, as ""antithetical to quality medical care"" and called for its ""elimination"". Massachusetts is the only state to ban AD, effective 1/1/2009. Using a novel data of ambulance use developed from administrative data from Medicare and Boston Emergency Medical Services, this study will use quasi-experimental methods to estimate the causal impact of AD on ambulance travel, type of destination ED, patient mortality, length of stay, and costs.            ",Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Due to Ambulance Diversion,9028091,R01HL127212,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Ambulances ', ' Boston ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cost Measures ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Destinations ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' beneficiary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Natural experiment ', ' safety net ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' longitudinal database ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Patient risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,536774,0.11391560631937965
"Lifecourse health, cerebral pathology and ethnic disparities in dementia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A primary objective of the 2012 National Alzheimer's Plan Act was to decrease racial disparities of dementia. While it is known that certain ethnoracial groups such as Blacks have higher rates of dementia, reasons for disparities are unknown. The NIH State of the Science on Preventing Cognitive Decline recommended a life course approach to identifying modifiable risk and protective factors. Whether early life factors contribute to ethnic disparities in dementia and cognitive decline and how these variables relate to brain changes that may mediate disparities is not well understood. Further, effects of risk and protective factors may vary across ethnoracial groups. Most of what is known about risk and protective factors and brain mechanisms for dementia is from studies of non-Hispanic whites. We propose an unprecedented lifecourse study of disparities in late life cognitive decline and dementia using a large multi-ethnoracial sample of current Kaiser Permanente health system members who participated in the Multiphasic Health Study (MHS) extending from 1964-1991. MHS data, joined with electronic medical records from 1996-present, provide up to 50 years of comprehensive, prospectively collected data. Eighteen hundred (450 Black, 450 Hispanic, 450 White, 450 Asian) MHS participants aged 65+ will receive cognitive and clinical evaluations at 3 time points to rigorously characterize prevalence and incidence of dementia and measure cognitive decline using well-validated tests for ethnoracially diverse older adults. Structural MRI and Amyloid PET will be obtained on a random sub sample of 400 non-demented individuals to characterize cerebral amyloid burden, vascular lesions, and neuronal injury (atrophy). Our objectives are to delineate why there are racial/ethnic disparities in dementia and how life course risk and protective factors and brain mechanisms differ across ethnoracial groups. We will do so with three Specific Aims: 1) Evaluate ethnoracial differences in dementia incidence and cognitive decline, 2) Evaluate how early life experience, life course health, and genetics influence ethnoracial differences in cognitive decline and dementia, 3) Characterize paths by which ethnicity/race and cumulative vascular risk influence brain status (amyloid, vascular brain injury, atrophy) and cognitive decline.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 2012 President Obama signed the National Alzheimer's Plan Act with a primary objective to decrease racial disparities of dementia. While it is known that certain ethnoracial groups such as Blacks have higher rates of dementia, reasons for these disparities are unknown. We propose an unprecedented lifecourse study of ethnic disparities in late life cognitive outcomes using a large multi-ethnic sample with over 5 decades of prospectively collected life history and health data.

"Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) provides Georgia and the region with comprehensive clinical, research, and educational programs. This renewal application outlines our success in building an environment that encourages and supports innovative projects with a general theme of discovery and translation of new targets and mechanisms to enable early identification, early interventions, and ultimately prevention of AD. Given the well documented disparities in clinical research participation and burden of disease for AD in the African American community, the Emory ADRC focuses special effort to understand and address inter-individual differences in AD, ranging from ethno-racial factors to personal differences in genetic and protein variation. We benefit from generous institutional support from Emory, one of the nation's fastest growing research academic medical centers, the generous Atlanta community, and a highly collaborative team from more than 20 departments and centers. Five Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology, and Outreach Recruitment and Education), coordinate activities to effectively recruit, evaluate, and engage a diverse cohort of volunteers who actively participate in a wide variety of research studies that aim to better define the trajectory from normal cognitive aging to symptomatic stages of disease. Data from the Cores are captured and stored for distribution to local researchers and for national collaborations. Our biospecimen banks include well-characterized neuropathological case materials, blood and CSF, and DNA. These valuable resources are distributed widely for a variety of approved studies of genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and pathological investigations. The ADRC educational programs reach a broad audience of students, health care professionals, and the public. Three cutting edge research projects are closely integrated with ADRC Cores: Project 1, AD Biomarkers and Endothelial Dysfunction in Caucasians and African Americans, is a longitudinal biomarker study with full integration into the ADRC Clinical Core and OREC, leveraging a unique community based Registry for Remembrance to facilitate recruitment of African Americans; Project 2, A Proteogenomic Approach to Understanding AD GWAS Results, proposes to use state-of-the art targeted gene resequencing and mass spectrometer-based protein sequencing to advance understanding of genetic risk of AD by genetic loci by linking novel gene variants at 20+ recently identified loci directly with the encoded and expressed protein variants in AD brain in an allele specific manner; Project 3, Defining the Properties of Pathogenic Aβ strains in Alzheimer's Disease, takes an interdisciplinary approach to build on pioneering work showing AD brain extracts are transmissible in animal models, by investigating how structural differences in Aβ strains from asymptomatic vs. symptomatic stages of AD vary in their seeding and propagation in yeast and animal models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Emory ADRC has grown dramatically during the past funding cycles (years 6-10), and now seeks a 3rd renewal (years 11-15). The ADRC contributes to the NIH/NIA-funded network and plays a critical role in the coordinated response to the growing public health threat from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emory's active participation in the network fosters research to understand the causes, investigate novel targets and interventions that will lead to more effective treatments and prevention, and

"The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study Project Summary Identification of successful prevention and treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has remained elusive, partially because clinical symptoms of AD have a late presentation in disease development, but also because there are not clear targets directly related to AD neuropathology for which definitive treatment is available. Thus, focusing on possible treatment and prevention targets that can be identified well before onset of clinical disease and which are known to be treatable is critical in addressing AD. The vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia, including AD, offers an important opportunity for prevention and treatment. Further, evidence suggests that vascular risk factors, including hypertension and diabetes, as well as brain cerebrovascular changes (i.e. white matter hyperintensities), contribute most to the development of cognitive decline and dementia when they are present in midlife (well before clinical AD usually presents). Some of this evidence has been established by the ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a community-based biracial cohort study of individuals from four US communities, with nearly 30 years of vascular risk factors and marker data, and its primary ancillary study, the ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC- NCS). The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study, the renewal of which is being proposed in this application, built on the valuable data available in ARIC and ARIC-NCS. By focusing on brain amyloid- deposition, which in leading hypotheses is responsible for the development of AD, the ARIC-PET study further evaluated the associations between midlife vascular risk factors and AD. In the initial phase of this study, we completed 347 brain amyloid PET scans, using florbetapir PET, among participants from three ARIC sites. We found higher rates of brain amyloid in participants who were older, female, carried an APOE 4 allele (the primary genetic risk factor for AD), and who were of black race. Although our data did not support a general association between midlife vascular risk factors and brain amyloid, for persons with “two hits”: a high genetic risk (carriers of an APOE 4 allele) and elevated midlife vascular risk, our data do suggest more brain amyloid deposition. Finally, our data suggest that cognition is worse among participants who have both elevated brain amyloid and high amounts of brain cerebrovascular disease, on MRI. This renewal application proposes a repeat brain MRI and florbetapir (amyloid) PET scan among all surviving non-demented participants of ARIC-PET, to evaluate how vascular risk factors and brain subclinical vascular changes and APOE genotype each contribute to the progression of brain amyloid as well as the progression of clinical cognitive status, including conversion to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Further, we will evaluate progression of brain cerebrovascular changes as a risk factor for progression of brain amyloid and clinical cognitive status, which we hypothesize may provide a critical link to explain some of our observed racial disparities in amyloid deposition rates. The ARIC-PET cohort provides unique data in a biracial sample; data from its renewal could identify important targets for prevention. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that vascular risk factors play a major role in the development of dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET Amyloid imaging study used PET scans to further understand the role of vascular disease in Alzheimer’s, and the studies proposed in this renewal will test how change in vascular disease relates to change in brain amyloid and cognition.

"Nonlinear Models of Cognition Preceding AD and non-AD in a Biracial Population Sample This proposal aims to conduct secondary analyses of existing data to examine nonlinear cognitive decline in standardized global summary of cognition assessed using executive functioning, episodic memory, and overall global cognition and orientation within the context of a large population-based study of older adults: Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). More specifically, the four objectives of this proposal are: 1) Examine Nonlinear Cognitive Decline in Older Blacks and Whites Using Change Point Models in a Random Sample of 2,948 Participants with AD and non-AD Diagnosis; 2) investigate the Role of Demographic, Social, Lifestyle, Cardiovascular, and Genetic Risk Factors on Nonlinear Cognitive Decline in Older Blacks and Whites with AD and non-AD Diagnosis; 3) Identify the Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Cognitive Decline Using Latent Class Growth Curve Models Using a Population Sample of 7,757 Blacks and Whites with Multiple Cognitive Assessments; 4) Understand the Role of Demographic, Social, Lifestyle, Cardiovascular, and Genetic Risk Factors on Latent Class Memberships to Explain Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Cognitive Decline. Understanding the rate of cognitive decline in older blacks and whites has a topic of considerable interest. However, most research has focused on linear trajectories in whites with mixed findings among blacks. Nonlinear cognitive decline based on change points are nonexistent in blacks and the proposed work can increase our understanding of preclinical phase of AD and non-AD. Description: This proposal aims to conduct a secondary data analysis to study the nonlinear changes in cognitive function using change point models for decline preceding AD and non-AD and the covariate effects of five sets of risk factors, namely, demographic, social, lifestyle, cardiovascular, and genetic on nonlinear cognitive decline. The study also proposed the use of latent class growth curve models to examine the heterogeneity in population- level cognition and nonlinear cognitive decline in a population-based longitudinal study of older adults. This proposal is based on a longitudinal cohort of 7,757 older adults who were followed for about 19 years with data collection done every 3 years for cognitive assessments. The clinical diagnosis of AD and non-AD is available on 2,948 participants who were sampled using a stratified random sample.

"Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): India, the second-most populous country in the world, will soon experience rapid aging of its population. By 2050, India's older population (> 60 years old) is projected to reach 320 million (about the current size of the entire US population), representing an increase from 8 to 20 percent of its total population. The growing number of older people will drive a large increase in the prevalence of dementia in India, far exceeding the capacity of the private care system that currently predominates for the elderly. The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), a survey of 50,000 Indians representative of the older population across the nation and within its states and union territories, provides a unique opportunity to examine this and related issues. LASI is the most ambitious nationally representative study of the physical, mental, economic, and social well-being of the country's older population. Harmonized with other Health and Retirement Study (HRS) surveys, it offers an evidence base that can be used to compare the effects of social policies aimed at supporting older persons in India with policies used in other countries around the world. The objective of the proposed research is to supplement the current LASI in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in India. Previous efforts to identify dementia in developing nations have typically relied on non- representative samples in geographically restricted regions. In this application, we aim to develop a protocol for the assessment of dementia and MCI to be used within community settings in the ongoing, nationally representative LASI. To do so, we will first conduct in-depth cognitive testing for a sub-sample of LASI respondents at regional geriatric hospitals in India. Specifically, we will administer two leading dementia assessment protocols - the HRS Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) and the 10/66 Dementia Protocol - to approximately 2,000 respondents at least 60 years of age and stratified by their Wave 1 cognition test results, as well as their proximity to collaborating regional geriatic hospitals where the assessments will occur. Based on prognostic evaluation of the protocols, we will develop a short (15-minute) dementia assessment module and administer it in Wave 2 to persons with a high probability of having dementia and MCI as well as to the 2,000 persons participating in the earlier assessment. Using these data, we will estimate prevalence rates of dementia and MCI in India for the population and sub-populations. We will provide to the research community data generated from the in-depth cognitive testing at regional geriatric hospitals and from the administration of the short dementia assessment module during Wave 2, both linked to the on-going LASI main survey. Our harmonized protocol for dementia and MCI assessment will enable researchers to make comparisons with prior findings in India using the 10/66 protocol as well as to conduct cross-country studies with the United States, England, China, and other countries that implement the HRS HCAP protocol. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide a means for estimating the prevalence of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment for India that can be adapted to other harmonized surveys of aging in developing countries. The longitudinal nature of the project will provide insight on deterioration of cognitive abilities among the aged over time. The generated data will help researchers and policymakers determine the costs and burdens associated with providing care for older persons with diminished cognitive abilities.",Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI),9307246,R01AG051125,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Castes ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration / HMO ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospitals ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Social Policies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' Sister ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Venous ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' social situation ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Physical Performance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,175884,0.09824972097763647
"School Quality and Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease in Project Talent The American Institutes for Research (AIR) will provide staff for the School Quality and Racial Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease in Project Talent study and will assist Dr. Jennifer Manly (PI, Columbia University) in activities to create shared data resources and to support all aspects of this research project. Socioeconomic adversity in early life is a risk factor for poor brain health—impaired cognitive function and cerebrovascular disease—in later life, but some individuals are resilient, achieving better-than-expected outcomes despite facing early life adversity. The mechanisms of resilience, as well as the causal pathways between early life adversity and later life brain health, are unclear, but educational experiences are very likely critical. This project will focus on mortality, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health conditions that increase risk for cerebrovascular disease, all outcomes that have been linked to early life socioeconomic adversity, and will evaluate the role of educational experiences in potentially promoting resilience to early life adversity. A central research question in our evaluation of school quality and long term impacts on brain health is whether there are racial/ethnic differences in the benefits of attending higher quality schools or the mechanisms though which education influences later health. The study will include ~9000 participants, currently aged 69-74, to assess cognitive abilities, health, and other aspects of resilience. Other innovations of this study include: a contemporary battery of cognitive abilities measures harmonized with several of the original 1960 measures, allowing direct measurement of change across 1960 to 2017 on multiple cognitive abilities; use of adaptive testing to reduce participant burden; and assessment via mailed tablet computers to facilitate measurement of memory and visuospatial abilities. This study has many advantages, including its sample size, prospective design, high quality measurement of multiple cognitive abilities in adolescence and older adulthood, assessment of educational quality and experiences, cognitive complexity of occupational and leisure activities, all in the context of its unique design that provides an unprecedented opportunity to address causal hypotheses.

"Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this application, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a presidentially initiated effort to understand the genetics of AD in hopes of developing new targets for therapies. Currently lacking in these efforts, however, is the inclusion of African American (AA) populations and the generalization of research findings to AA communities. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we propose a set of experiments that will complement the activities in the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases while addressing the issue of health disparities in AA AD research.        ",Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans,9338997,U01AG052410,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maps ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Community Networks ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapeutic development ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' clinical practice ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' precision medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' SNP array ', ' SNP chip ', ' admixture mapping ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2016,465972,0.04163752629583948
"Race, Childhood Social Disadvantage, and the Adult Brain: HANDLS BRAINCHILD. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed career development plan is to launch the candidate's independent research career investigating the mechanisms by which racial disparities in exposure to early life social disadvantage (ELSD) promote accelerated subclinical and clinical brain pathology in African Americans (AA) across the life course. There are pronounced AA-White disparities in brain health endpoints including stroke, dementia, and cognitive decline. Recent data suggest that earlier disparities in brain health are also noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Exposure to greater ELSD - characterized by harsher residential and neighborhood environments and lower parental socioeconomic status (SES) - may chart a course towards an accelerated onset of and more severe brain pathology observed in AAs as characterized by multiple MRI-assessed indicators of subclinical brain pathology including lower gray matter (GM) volumes, greater white matter lesion volumes and lesser WM integrity. This application was originally submitted in response to the NIA K01 PAR- 09-136, ""Promoting Careers in Aging and Health Disparities Research"" that sought to delineate social factors that precipitate late life health disparities among minorities and elders from disadvantaged backgrounds. Due to discontinuation of that PAR, the current application is a resubmission to the NIA K01 PA-11-190, Mentored Research Scientist Development Award. This K01 will allow the candidate to extend her prior training on the relation of psychosocial factors to coronary heart disease risk among adolescent and early to midlife AAs by providing training in (1) the life course perspective and accelerated theories of aging, particularly as applied to racial disparities in social disadvantage and health, and (2) the brain and related vasculature, and MRI- indicators of brain pathology including subclinical cerebrovascular disease. The proposed project will be a substudy to the ongoing HANDLS SCAN project - itself an ancillary study to the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study, a 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the NIA Intramural Research Program that assesses health disparities in > 3,500 AA and White adults (ages 30-64 at baseline) living in Baltimore, MD. In up to 400 HANDLS participants, HANDLS SCAN examines the relations of race and adult SES to MRI-indicators of brain pathology that may underlie risk for stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline. In the proposed study, 300 HANDLS SCAN participants will complete measures of ELSD to determine: (1) whether ELSD is related to MRI-indicators of brain pathology predictive of future stroke, cognitive, and functional decline, and whether these associations are more pronounced in AAs than in White adults, and (2) explore potential psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical mediators of these associations. The interdisciplinary training outlined in this application will allow the candidate o carve out a unique and unmatched research program that is desperately warranted by the pronounced prevalence of cerebrovascular and other brain disease in AAs. The interrelations among life course social disadvantage, accelerated aging, and brain health endpoints have been grossly understudied and are crucial to developing appropriate prevention and intervention strategies geared toward reducing and ultimately eliminating race-related health disparities in brain aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pronounced racial disparities are observed across multiple clinical and subclinical brain health endpoints in African Americans compared to Whites and may be attributable, in part, to accelerated age-related disease processes. Great public health relevance lies in our ability to understand the relation of racial disparities in early life social disadvantage to subclinical markers of brain pathology predictive of future clinical endpoints such as stroke, dementia, and cognitive and physical decline in African Americans, and related multi-level mediators of this relation. Such research can facilitate development of appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in multiple brain health endpoints.","Race, Childhood Social Disadvantage, and the Adult Brain: HANDLS BRAINCHILD.",9086178,K01AG043581,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Cholesterol ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' indexing ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maryland ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Relation of estrogen pathway genes to cognitive decline in elderly women and men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will provide additional education and training for Dr. Sarah Janicki to establish herself as a clinical translational scientist in the hormonal mediators of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). An integrated multidisciplinary didactic and practical training program has been developed to allow Dr. Janicki to accomplish the following goals: 1) extend her training in advanced methods in the genetic epidemiology of aging; 2) learn and use longitudinal data analytic techniques; 3) develop expertise in neuromorphometric analytic techniques of structural MRI data; 4) transition to an independent career as a clinical translational scientist. Dr. Janicki's training program is supported by committed and enthusiastic mentorship from a panel of renowned experts in the genetics, epidemiology, cognitive assessment and neuroimaging of AD, and benefits from an outstanding intellectual environment, opportunities for career growth, and substantial institutional commitment. The objectives of the proposed research plan are to determine the contribution of estrogen biosynthetic pathway gene variants to cognitive decline, and to employ neuroimaging analyses to determine the underlying neurobiological pathways through which polymorphisms in these genes affect cognitive decline in elderly men and women of different ethnicities. Investigations in the neuropathology, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological studies of AD suggest that it is an estrogen-sensitive disease. Many prior studies evaluating the effect of estrogen on cognitive decline and brain morphology in the elderly have used study populations receiving exogenous estrogen supplementation, since age-related declines in endogenous hormones do not allow accurate assessment of estrogen status. However, hormone replacement therapy may have different effects on brain morphology than does lifelong hormone exposure due to composition and administration late in life. This study uses variants in genes of known estrogen receptor and biosynthetic function (ESR1, ESR2, CYP17, CYP19, and HSD17B1) as instrumental variables to estimate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on changes in neuropsychological cognitive assessments and structural brain outcomes. The study population includes elderly men and women from the Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP) and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Confirmatory analyses of significant findings will be performed in the Rotterdam Study (RS). Exploratory aims will examine how the effects of estrogen SNPs may vary by ethnicity due to socioeconomic and cerebrovascular risk factors associated with risk for cognitive decline. This study will lay the groundwork for future R01 grant applications identifying mechanisms of hormone action that direct areas of intervention in AD. This application directly supports the National Institute on Aging's proposed mission to conduct genetic and biological research related to diseases associated with aging, its objective to understand health differences and inequities associated with race, ethnicity, and gender among older adults, and its stated commitment to foster the development of clinician scientists in aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to determine the contribution of estrogen and testosterone gene variants to cognitive decline, and to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses to determine the underlying pathways through which variants in these genes affect cognitive decline in elderly men and women. The exploratory aims of this study evaluate whether the mechanisms by which estrogen gene variants affect cognitive decline vary by ethnicity. Examining how estrogen pathway gene variants influence brain morphology and specifically contribute to cognitive decline in both elderly men and women of different ethnicities will improve understanding of how development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is affected by hormones, and will guide the design of more appropriate gender-based treatments for AD in the future.",Relation of estrogen

"White Matter Hyperintentisities in Aging and Dementia As the older segment of our population increases, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has emerged as one of the most devastating international public health epidemics. There are currently no effective disease-modifying treatment or preventative strategies available. Current pathogenic models and newly implemented diagnostic criteria for AD emphasize a single pathway of disease pathogenesis, but underestimate the important contribution of vascular risk factors and of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, which manifests primarily as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During the previous four years of this project (R01 AG034189), we confirmed our hypotheses that accumulation of WMH predicts incident AD, particularly when distributed in parietal regions, and is associated with the presence of cerebral microbleeds, an indicator of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in a large multi-ethnic cohort of older adults. Accordingly, we extended our research to examine mechanistic interactions between cerebrovascular disease and AD. Our new preliminary data suggest that individuals with evidence of fibrillar amyloidosis have increased parietal lobe WMH and that hemodynamic markers of autoregulatory dysfunction are associated with both WMH and amyloid deposition, which in turn interact to promote the clinical expression of AD. This proposed competitive renewal will continue our systematic evaluation of the intersection between regional WMH and AD, and ask innovative and novel questions about the role of cerebral autoregulation and bloodbased lipid biomarkers. The aims of the project are: 1. To examine whether regional WMH and amyloid pathology confer independent or interactive risk for cognitive decline, clinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and neurodegeneration, indexed by regional atrophy, across racial and ethnic groups; 2. To examine the relationship of autoregulation with WMH severity, amyloid pathology, and cognition and diagnosis; and 3. To explore established and newly-modeled blood-based lipidomic profiles and their association with WMH and amyloid pathology. Importantly, we will examine the extent to which small vessel cerebrovascular disease accounts for racial and ethnic disparities in cognitive decline, and diagnosis of MCI or AD. Beginning in 2012, 500 individuals from a newly-established ethnically and racially diverse older adult cohort received clinical evaluation, high-resolution structural MRI, and a subset (n=100) received positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify fibrillar forms of beta amyloid. The current study seeks to conduct longitudinal analysis on these individuals by repeating these procedures, in addition to collecting transcranial Doppler-derived measures of cerebral autoregulation and analyzing stored blood samples for lipid profiles. The study will provide novel mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of AD and identify new targets for intervention. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase, yet the causes of this devastating disease are poorly understood. This project will examine the degree to which small vessel cerebrovascular contributes independently or interactively to the development and clinical expression of AD across racial and ethnic groups. It will also examine the roles of cerebral autoregulation and lipid biomarkers to provide novel mechanistic insight into the disease and help identify new targets for intervention.",White Matter

"Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease progression; and amyloid- directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD. For ~10 years, the Principal Investigator has conducted studies on the effects of fitness adaptation on cardiovascular (CV) health. Recently, he received 2 years of funding to examine the effects of 3-times/week 6-month aerobic exercise-training on cognition in the laboratory setting. This ongoing study has allowed the Principal Investigator to demonstrate the ability to recruit, enroll, test, collect and manage related neuroimaging pilot data in a predominantly AA sample. While such a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation, such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of cognitive deterioration. To logically extend this ongoing work, he seeks to initiate an 18-month study, testing real-life applicability o the effects of exercise adaptation on memory in a more ideal community setting. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach will bolster retention. The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up) aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. We will test our hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and 2.) stretch-exercise (control). We proposed that the aerobic-exercise group will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, we will determine whether training- induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain volume. Explanatorily, we will also investigate intervention effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1α) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition. A team of experienced investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations supported by DCOA), we will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the aerobic-exercise group will follow a  prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using appropriate multivariate methods. While we remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of our ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 8 months) and therefore allow for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures; test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory. Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical, psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia constituting ~2/3 of all late-life cases. Based on 2011 estimates, the annual health care cost for dementia is ~$183 billion. Given this staggering cost, and the projected increase in elderly population by the year 2030, identifying effective mechanisms to ward off structural and functional declines associated with AD is an important public health goal as evidenced by recent presidential initiatives (reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for, persons with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease). Unfortunately, this  well-intended public health goal cannot be achieved without an effective dementia preventive strategy. Fortunately, lifestyle-induced preservation of intellectual dexterity among those showing earliest symptoms of cognitive deterioration may ameliorate the physical, emotional, and economic burden associated with loss of cognitive vitality.

"Offpsring Study of Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease The overall aim of this study is to identify underlying biological and sociocultural mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive function among a middle-aged cohort of 3,000 offspring whose parents do and do not have Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Studies of non-Hispanic Whites have shown that children of people with AD are at increased risk of developing the disease, and that factors such as parental age at onset and APOE allele status may modify risk associated with a family history of AD. Rates of AD are two to three times higher among Hispanic and African American than among non-Hispanic White elders and the prevalence of many cardiovascular and demographic risk factors for AD is higher among ethnic minorities than among non- Hispanic Whites. However, potential mediators and modifiers of family risk have not been well examined among racial and ethnic minorities, nor has much prior work been conducted among families where data from detailed clinical and biomarker examinations on parents were available from in-person examinations. Since pathology begins to manifest in the brain in the fifth and sixth decades of life, we propose that mechanisms for racial/ethnic disparities can be more clearly revealed in middle age and thus help to clarify the determinants and pathways of ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment with aging and potential critical periods for intervention. Our overarching hypothesis is that the primary mode of transmission of parental AD risk among racial/ethnic minorities is via vascular and social pathways, while the primary transmission of parental AD risk among Whites is via genetic pathways that affect amyloid deposition in the brain. Specifically, the project will 1) determine which biological mediators of parental risk of AD on offspring cognition differ most across race/ethnicity, 2) determine which educational, economic, and social moderators of parental risk of AD on offspring cognition differ most across race/ethnicity, and 3) use directly measured parental risk factor data to refine our understanding of mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in AD. The prevalence of AD and the societal and economic burden associated with AD treatment and care is expected to rise as baby boomers enter old age. This is particularly true of African Americans and Hispanics who are at higher risk for AD than similarly aged non-Hispanic Whites. Offspring of elders with AD are at increased risk of developing the disease. It is therefore critical to identify factors that may increase or lower risk of AD, and may reduce disparities in AD, particularly in the 4th and 5th decades of life when pathology begins to manifest in the brain and when intervention may delay or prevent onset.",Offpsring Study of Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease,9194713,RF1AG054070,"['social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', '

"Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): India, the second-most populous country in the world, will soon experience rapid aging of its population. By 2050, India's older population (> 60 years old) is projected to reach 320 million (about the current size of the entire US population), representing an increase from 8 to 20 percent of its total population. The growing number of older people will drive a large increase in the prevalence of dementia in India, far exceeding the capacity of the private care system that currently predominates for the elderly. The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), a survey of 50,000 Indians representative of the older population across the nation and within its states and union territories, provides a unique opportunity to examine this and related issues. LASI is the most ambitious nationally representative study of the physical, mental, economic, and social well-being of the country's older population. Harmonized with other Health and Retirement Study (HRS) surveys, it offers an evidence base that can be used to compare the effects of social policies aimed at supporting older persons in India with policies used in other countries around the world. The objective of the proposed research is to supplement the current LASI in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in India. Previous efforts to identify dementia in developing nations have typically relied on non- representative samples in geographically restricted regions. In this application, we aim to develop a protocol for the assessment of dementia and MCI to be used within community settings in the ongoing, nationally representative LASI. To do so, we will first conduct in-depth cognitive testing for a sub-sample of LASI respondents at regional geriatric hospitals in India. Specifically, we will administer two leading dementia assessment protocols - the HRS Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) and the 10/66 Dementia Protocol - to approximately 2,000 respondents at least 60 years of age and stratified by their Wave 1 cognition test results, as well as their proximity to collaborating regional geriatic hospitals where the assessments will occur. Based on prognostic evaluation of the protocols, we will develop a short (15-minute) dementia assessment module and administer it in Wave 2 to persons with a high probability of having dementia and MCI as well as to the 2,000 persons participating in the earlier assessment. Using these data, we will estimate prevalence rates of dementia and MCI in India for the population and sub-populations. We will provide to the research community data generated from the in-depth cognitive testing at regional geriatric hospitals and from the administration of the short dementia assessment module during Wave 2, both linked to the on-going LASI main survey. Our harmonized protocol for dementia and MCI assessment will enable researchers to make comparisons with prior findings in India using the 10/66 protocol as well as to conduct cross-country studies with the United States, England, China, and other countries that implement the HRS HCAP protocol. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide a means for estimating the prevalence of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment for India that can be adapted to other harmonized surveys of aging in developing countries. The longitudinal nature of the project will provide insight on deterioration of cognitive abilities among the aged over time. The generated data will help researchers and policymakers determine the costs and burdens associated with providing care for older persons with diminished cognitive abilities.",Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI),9140086,R01AG051125,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Castes ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration / HMO ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospitals ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Social Policies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' Sister ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Venous ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' social situation ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Physical Performance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,538792,0.09824972097763647
"Impact of estrogen  loss and replacement on GluN2B containing NMDARs, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory in females using a novel transgenic rat model of Alzheimer’s Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease targets two-thirds more women than men, likely a result of hormone loss during menopause. Clinical and preclinical data support beneficial roles of 17estradiol (E2) and its replacement post-menopause on neuronal function, amyloid and tau pathology, and cognition. However, it is unknown how E2 improves or maintains synaptic processes underlying cognitive function throughout early asymptomatic and symptomatic disease progression. Abnormal activation of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs and loss of synaptic GluN2Bcontaining NMDAR as a consequence of increased soluble toxic Aand increased activity of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP are believed to mediate synaptic deficits in presymptomatic AD. The increased activation of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs appears to mediate spine loss and LTP deficits in hippocampus in transgenic AD mice. Therefore, minimizing aberrant extrasynaptic GluN2B-NMDAR activation early in the disease is critical to delaying its onset and slowing its progression. Importantly, proestrous-like levels of plasma E2 not only increases spine density and LTP, it selectively increases synaptic current mediated by GluN2Bcontaining NMDARs that are critical for the E2-enhanced learning and memory. These beneficial effects of E2 could directly oppose the negative effects of increased soluble Ao, but whether E2 can stimulate these synaptic changes in the context of accumulating AD pathology is an open question. We will use a novel transgenic rat model of AD, TgF334-AD, and brain slice electrophysiology combined with learning and memory behavior to test the overarching hypothesis that that proestrous-like E2 replacement can heighten synaptic function in OVX Tg females by increasing synaptic and decreasing extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs along with their associated signaling molecules, which will be linked to increased synaptic plasticity and learning and memory.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease afflicts two-thirds more women than men, likely a result of ovarian hormone loss during menopause. We will use a novel transgenic Alzheimer's disease rat model to thoroughly investigate the protective mechanisms triggered by proestrous levels of E2 on hippocampal synaptic function and learning and

"Risk Factors for Stroke and Cognitive Decline in a Tri-Ethnic Region ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke, cognitive impairment and dementia are increasing public health problems with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The National Alzheimer's Project Act and the NIH have recommended more extensive studies on the risk and determinants of dementia in disparities populations. Elucidation of the relationships between traditional and novel vascular risk factors for stroke, dementia, cognitive impairment, and disability is critical to enhance our ability to modify the risk of these conditions. The Northern Manhattan Study consists of a population-based cohort of 3497 stroke-free adults who have been followed annually for a median of 13.9 years. This collaborative prospective cohort study among whites, blacks, and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community is an outstanding resource to address health disparities involving faculty across three institutions (Columbia University, University of Miami, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). The cohort is well characterized and the 1290 subjects among the MRI sub-cohort have had a standardized brain MRI and two neuropsychological assessments over 5 years. The new aims are to determine the relationship between cognitive trajectories and a novel neuro-immune and inflammatory biomarker panel; determine the relationship between brain imaging biomarkers (regional brain volumes, regional white matter lesion burden, hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, small dilated perivascular spaces, dolichoectasia) and cognitive trajectories and dementia; determine the risk and vascular determinants of dementia; characterize the vascular determinants of functional impairment, disability, and quality of life; and assess the relationship between novel risk factors and specific ischemic stroke subtypes. To accomplish these aims, subjects will continue to be followed annually by telephone to ascertain stroke, MI, death and change in cognitive status, and more extensive functional assessments will be collected. A third expanded in-person neuropsychological assessment will be done among the MRI subcohort and a dementia consensus conference will ascertain and classify dementia. Stored plasma at the time of MRI will be used to measure an innovative inflammatory and immune biomarker panel, and new MRI measures will be analyzed on the already collected brain MRIs. The strengths of this prospective cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of novel serum biomarkers and brain imaging biomarkers, and the expanded focus on comprehensive outcomes including cognitive trajectories, dementia, functional impairment, and ischemic stroke subtypes. The results of these studies will be instrumental in the design of intervention programs to prevent stroke and cognitive decline in diverse populations and be a valuable shared data resource. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and dementia are increasing public health problems with a larger impact on blacks and Hispanics.

"Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this application, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a presidentially initiated effort to understand the genetics of AD in hopes of developing new targets for therapies. Currently lacking in these efforts, however, is the inclusion of African American (AA) populations and the generalization of research findings to AA communities. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we propose a set of experiments that will complement the activities in the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases while addressing the issue of health disparities in AA AD research.        ",Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans,9078972,U01AG052410,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maps ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Community Networks ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapeutic development ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' clinical practice ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' precision medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' SNP array ', ' SNP chip ', ' admixture mapping ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2016,960812,0.04163752629583948
"Racial Disparities in the Health of Caregivers for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease Over the past 50 years, health and functional status of the American population has continued to improve but these improvements have not been equally distributed across races, ethnicities and socioeconomic groups. Perhaps nowhere is the challenge to reduce health disparities more apparent than in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. Risk of AD is higher among ethnic minorities, and because many public and private insurers do not cover institutionalized or paid home health care services that individuals with these diseases require, the burdens faced by family caregivers from diverse racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds is high. The goals of this project are two-fold. First, we will estimate predictive models of cognitive decline, AD onset, other health and functional status changes of middle age and older Americans. We model caregiving for person with AD and analyze and quantify how health and other indicators of well being evolve over the life course for caregivers of family members with AD and contribute to health disparities. Second, we will utilize a dynamic micro simulation model of health, cognitive decline and economic outcomes to quantify health of future populations and burden of AD across diverse groups. Our ability to achieve the proposed aims is enhanced by use of the best data sets available for this research and that are established NIH-funded longitudinal cohorts: the Health and Retirement Study and its sub-study the Aging Demographics and Memory Study. It is further enhanced by a team of researchers with expertise in both dementia and microsimulation. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is high and growing and its impact is not equally distributed across races, ethnicities and socioeconomic groups. We propose to analyze the burden of AD and its impact on family caregivers from diverse backgrounds. We will estimate the life course trajectories of health changes, cognitive and functional decline and AD onset of middle age and older Americans across racial and ethnic groups. We will analyze how well being diverges for caregivers of persons with AD and how it contribute to health disparities.

"Alzheimer's Disease & Related Dementias: Geography, Environments, and Mechanisms Post-menopausal and older women are a vulnerable population in the research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). ADRD affects more women than men, and increasing evidence indicates different risk factors by sex. While the search for effective prevention continues, we only have limited knowledge about environmental risk factors, especially those modifiable in late life. In the US, there are well- documented regional differences in both prevalence and mortality of dementia, but no studies have provided useful insights for modifiable environmental factors. Although an important step towards identifying modifiable environmental factors, investigating within-country geographic differences in ADRD risks remains a great challenge, as it requires substantial investment to follow a prospective cohort and employ identical, well- validated protocols to ascertain incident dementia in multi-site populations. In a nationwide cohort of older women from the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), we recently reported the first evidence of geographic disparities in AD incidence. Our preliminary data also indicate that exposure to regional air pollutants is a novel neurotoxin associated with increased ADRD risks, but the ADRD geo-disparities were not explained by cardiovascular disease and other conventional risk factors. These findings highlight the critical need to examine other environmental-social determinants and further elucidate the mechanistic mediators. To address these knowledge gaps cost-efficiently, we propose to study the well-characterized and geographically- diverse cohorts of postmenopausal and older women in WHIMS (n=7479, aged 65-80) and WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS-Y; n=1336, aged 50-54), both followed annually since 1996. We will capitalize on extant data on hypothesized environmental determinants (ambient air pollutants; psychosocial factors; dietary patterns and fatty acids) and update outcomes (dementia subtype; annual neuropsychological assessment; longitudinal structural brain MRI) through 2016. In Aim 1, we will define the cognitive endophenotypes (CEP) predictive of ADRD, and examine how indicators of residential geography affect CEP and its progression. In Aim 2, we will construct multivariate structural equation models (SEMs) and test whether the hypothesized environmental factors contribute to the geo-disparities in CEP and ADRD risks. In Aim 3, we will use SEMs to evaluate brain structural correlates (prefrontal cortex; hippocampal-amygdalar complex; white matter) and small-vessel ischemia, putatively mediating the geo-environmental disparities in CEP. In Aim 4, we will explore the environmental interactions in shaping the geo-disparities in CEP and ADRD risks. A multidisciplinary team has been assembled to work together on this emerging field of environmental-social neurosciences on health disparities in population brain aging. Expected new knowledge gained from this R01 will help identify both adverse exposures and protective processes amenable to intervention, towards developing evidence-based, mechanistically-informed prevention strategies to reduce the geographical disparities in ADRD risks. Relevance to Public Health Places matter when counting the number of US older adults affected by or dying from Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), and increasing epidemiologic data suggest that where people live in late-life may determine the individual’s probability to develop ADRD. Hoping to better understand such geographic disparities in ADRD, the investigative team will study: (1) whether individuals could show earlier signs of declining cognitive functions several years before ADRD; (2) what environmental factors could possibly explain the difference in ADRD risks that depend on where people live; and (3) which parts of the human brains may be affected by where people live and how they differ in these possible environmental contributors. This project holds the promise to generate new knowledge about environmental risk factors in late life that are amenable to intervention, and better understanding why places matter in ADRD risks may contribute new approaches to developing effective prevention modalities, a national goal set in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease by 2025.","Alzheimer's Disease & Related Dementias:

"Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Core Center Overall – Project Summary  This application proposes a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSOM) to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD. Our Center will provide innovative resources to examine the contributions of metabolic and vascular factors to early phase transitions from normal aging to MCI and then to AD and other dementias, through coordinated research spanning the translational spectrum. Wake Forest is uniquely equipped to rapidly develop a high-impact ADCC because it has: 1) a deep, interdisciplinary foundation in aging research; 2) specialized expertise in metabolic and vascular factors and their relationship to cognitive aging and dementia; 3) strong ties to an ethnically diverse community with high prevalence of dementia and metabolic/vascular disorders; and 4) exceptional institutional support. The rationale for our theme is based on research showing that metabolic and vascular disorders are highly prevalent, modifiable factors that contribute to the transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias. To promote innovative translational research focused on these factors, the ADCC will enroll an observational multi-ethnic cohort from an existing 15-year study of metabolic/vascular risk, and leverage their extensive data by adding key endpoints to characterize AD and other dementias. The Clinical Core will enroll a separate cohort enriched for metabolic/vascular risk, along with participants with AD. The ADCC will focus on African-American (AA) and other underserved groups who are twice as likely to develop AD, and have high rates of diabetes and vascular disease. Specialized resources will be available to ADCC investigators, including non-human primate (NHP) models for translational research. A repository of human and NHP biospecimens, genetic/epigenetic data, and extensive clinical data will be available to NACC, NCRAD, and other investigators. The ADCC will also serve as a resource for a broad spectrum of AD initiatives. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Establish a comprehensive integrated research infrastructure focused on phase transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias, and provide special resources to accelerate research on metabolic and vascular factors; 2) Optimize the participation of AA adults to better understand the causes underlying their increased risk of AD and dementia; 3) Expand relationships with the national ADCC network and key affiliates such as NACC and NCRAD; 4) Provide training in translational research to new investigators, and education regarding AD and dementia to professionals, patients and families, and the community. The prevalence of metabolic and vascular risk factors, their importance to AD expression, the strengths of the Wake Forest scientific community in these research areas, and our outstanding institutional commitment are indicators that NIH funding will be successfully leveraged to establish an ADCC that will make high-impact contributions to the field. Overall – Project Narrative  This application seeks to establish a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine that will provide a comprehensive infrastructure for translational, interdisciplinary research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD and related disorders. Our ADCC will focus on the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and then to AD and other dementias, and understanding the contribution of metabolic and vascular factors to these transitions. The ADCC will enroll a diverse group of ~1,000 adults to facilitate the discovery of new biomarkers and promising targets for prevention and therapy. We will also utilize novel nonhuman primate models to promote pivotal mechanistic and translational research. Finally, we will educate new investigators in translational research practices, and health professionals, afflicted adults, their families, and their communities about AD and strategies for reducing risk.",Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Core Center,9172407,P30AG049638,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' pepper ', ' Capsicum ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Foundations ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Leadership ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Philanthropic Fund ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' vascular factor ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Research Activity ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolism Studies ', ' Metabolic Studies ', ' Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism ', ' metabolic abnormality assessment ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' syndrome x ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Phase Transition ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Prevention therapy ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' normal aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' health equity ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Vascular Cognitive Impairment ', ' vascular contributions ', "" Alzheimer's Disease Core Center "", ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' symptom treatment ', ' treat symptom ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,P30,2016,1746765,0.15997839045099807
"Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center ABSTRACT - OVERVIEW The overall goal of the proposed renewal of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (Rush ADCC) is to continue to support the performance of cutting edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of MCI, AD, and other common dementias, by providing researchers with a stimulating multi-disciplinary environment, and unique and highly valued clinical and post-mortem data, and ante- and post-mortem biologic specimens. The Rush ADCC has been in continuous operation since 1991. It has eight Cores carefully designed to support a variety of timely and important areas of research including studies: 1) of the transition from normal aging to MCI and to the earliest stages of dementia with substantial participation by racial and ethnic minorities, 2) linking risk factors to normal aging, incident MCI and incident AD, and to post-mortem indices of AD and mixed pathologies, 3) that incorporate contemporary high throughput biochemical and molecular data into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, and 4) that link neuroimaging and biofluid biomarkers to contemporary biochemical and molecular data, 5) that support drug discovery pipelines, and 6) that support studies of impaired motor function. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADCC as a whole. The Clinical Core will collect UDS and additional data on Blacks without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Religious Orders Study (ROS) Core will follow older members of Catholic religious communities who have agreed to annual evaluation and brain donation at death. The Latino Core will collect the same data as in ROS on older Latinos without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Neuropathology Core will process, store, evaluate and distribute biospecimens obtained by the Clinical, ROS, and Latino Cores. The Outreach and Recruitment Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities into the Clinical and Latino Cores, and other NIA funded initiatives. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to provide the infrastructure that allows all other Cores to be maximally successful and impactful, and will provide statistical support to users of ADCC resources especially junior investigators and trainees.

"Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral Vascular Disease in American Indians DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AIs) experience a disproportionately high incidence of cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) relative to non-Indians with twice the stroke rate of the general US population. Neuroimaging techniques have shown CBVD-related brain abnormalities to be associated with disruption of neurpsychological performance. Therapy for post-stroke cognitive impairment has been challenging. Cognitive therapy involves intense, focused, regular mental activity, intellectual stimulation, and behaviora exercises that assist individuals to regain or maintain cognitive function. and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia after brain insult. Interactive Metronome (IM) therapy is a promising form of behavioral therapy for CBVD-related cognitive and motor function. This technology uses operant conditioning of an individual's responses through simple, repetitive motor tasks (e.g., clapping hands, tapping feet) in time with a set beat. Through visual and auditory feedback, IM addresses processing speed, attention, and immediate and delayed memory, all of which can be affected by CBVD. IM therapy can improve quality of life, physical mobility, gait, and CBVD- related cognitive deficits. The ongoing Strong Heart Stroke Study (SHSS) (1R01HL093086-01A1; Dedra Buchwald, PI) is investigating CBVD-related brain abnormalities through MRI scans on 1000 AIs from the original SHS cohort. The proposed study will capitalize on this current SHSS to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to ascertain the effects of a culturally tailored IM intervention on cognition, depression, and quality of life. We ill target SHSS participants with subclinical CVBD defined by impaired cognitive processing speed. We will select a sample of 180 American Indians age 68 to 80 years participating in the SHSS. The specific Aims for this study of older American Indians are as follows: 1) Determine if the culturally-adapted IM intervention can improve cognitive functioning among older AIs with CBVD; and 2) Estimate the impact of IM on health-related quality of life. This study will yield important insights into the relationships among cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and brain abnormalities that can inform treatment efforts as one way to reducing AI CBVD disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will further our knowledge of the relationships among of cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and CBVD-related brain abnormalities providing valuable direction for more effective screening, treatment, and prevention of CBVD-related cognitive impairment. Thus, this study has significant health disparities implications for American Indians who exhibit the highest rates of stroke and related risk factors.",Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral

"Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Rural Dwelling Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although more than 20% of the US population live in rural areas, this is an underserved and understudied population. Rural adults suffer disproportionately poorer health and worse health outcomes compared with the rest of the nation. Considerably less research has focused on cognitive health outcomes and their risk factors among older, rural dwelling adults. Among these cognitive changes is mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that affects as many as 19% of older US adults and is widely recognized as a risk state for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias. As such, MCI represents a key target for interventions aimed at the secondary prevention of dementia. We have reason to believe that older, rural adults are especially vulnerable to MCI, based on known higher rates of factors associated with the syndrome. Complicating matters, limited resources and access to care may lead to delayed detection of cognitive changes, making rural adults an especially vulnerable group that is possibly deprived of opportunities for screening and early intervention in the disease process. Based on known rural health disparities, especially later diagnosis of chronic diseases, it is reasonable to hypothesize that MCI may present later in its course in rural adults, but studies describing older, rural dwelling adults with MCI are absent from the literature. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if rural residence is a unique risk factor for delayed detection of MCI. This novel study will examine MCI symptom severity and qualitative description to gain insight into rural cognitive health. The study seeks t advance the science by improving the understanding of MCI in a vulnerable population, which may ultimately direct the development of future health promotion research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poorer health outcomes in older, rural dwelling adults continue to be addressed in the literature, but one condition that is rapidly increasing among older adults, and yet has not been examined in this vulnerable population, is mild cognitive impairment. Mild cognitive impairment is a condition that is widely recognized as a risk state for Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias, and therefore, represents a key target for interventions aimed at the secondary prevention of dementia. The proposed research aims to describe cognitive decline in older rural dwelling adults to ultimately inform the development of future interventions or programs to slow disease progression and subsequently reduce dementia incidence in this vulnerable population.            ",Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Rural Dwelling Adults,9118002,F31NR015188,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Attention ', ' Boxing ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Health ', ' Science ', ' Syndrome ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Rural ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Future Generations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2016,17192,0.050595999577896275
"Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias:  The Role of Blood Pressure Throughout Adulthood PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health burden and disproportionately affect African Americans. The mechanisms underlying this disparity are not well-understood, but elevated blood pressure could be key. Compared with whites, African Americans have higher prevalence, earlier age of onset, and greater severity of hypertension. Thus, older African Americans tend to have greater cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure throughout adulthood than older whites. No prior research, however, has quantified the contribution of hypertension to racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. There are significant methodological challenges to addressing this important question, including (1) measurement of cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure from the age of onset of hypertension through late adulthood, (2) measurement of cognitive function in diverse populations, and (3) possible survival bias, which is likely to differentially affect African Americans. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify the extent to which elevated blood pressure from mid- through late- adulthood mediates racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This project uses an innovative approach to examine this important question with existing data from two diverse Northern California cohorts: the University of California, Davis Aging Diversity Cohort and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Multiphasic Health Checkup cohort, which links mid-adulthood physical examinations with long-term medical record information. Analyses will address the three major methodologic challenges outlined above by examining cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure as measured at multiple points in adulthood, developing a novel neuroimaging-based brain health index in a diverse population, and quantifying the potential magnitude of survival bias using comprehensive midlife data to account for differential survival. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) measuring and modeling cognitive function in diverse populations, (2) clinical assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, (3) assessing brain health with neuroimaging, and (4) the biology of vascular disease relevant to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career focused on identifying modifiable determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in diverse populations. The methodological challenges addressed in this project are common to many areas of research on disparities in aging and cumulative exposure to risk factors throughout the lifecourse for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health problem and disproportionally affect African American older adults. Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias have been identified as a national priority by the National Alzheimer’s Project Act. The results of this project will quantify what fraction of racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias could be eliminated by addressing disparities in hypertension.",Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias:  The Role of Blood Pressure Throughout Adulthood,9164027,K99AG053410,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Universities ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' vascular factor ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Measurement ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup examination ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neuropsychological ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' brain health ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2016,126291,0.14490228445878375
"Community-based End-of-life Intervention for African American Dementia Caregivers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End-of-life (EOL) care plans made in advance for relatives with dementia save families anguish in times of medical crises, but less than 13% of African Americans (AAs) have such plans. Yet, they have high morbidity and mortality rates from dementia. A community-based study will examine the efficacy of an education activation (EduAct) intervention for AA family caregiver healthcare proxies (HCPs) to make EOL decisions on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mechanical ventilation (MV), and tube feeding (TF). In a pre/posttest, two condition, repeated measure, randomized design, controlled efficacy trial, HCPs with no EOL care plans will be assigned to either EduAct or attention control groups. We will deliver 9 waves of 4 weekly sessions, a 4-mo booster tailored to residual knowledge deficits. We will enroll 304 AA HCPs (n=152 per group) in 4 urban AA churches randomly assigned to EduAct (n = 2) or control (n = 2) sites, with 8-9 subjects recruited concurrently at each site. The EduAct condition will receive interactive discussions from a nurse facilitator on EOL care planning, dementia, CPR, MV, and TF treatments. The attention control condition receives interactive health-promotion from another nurse facilitator. The Theory of Reasoned Action and Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory frameworks guide both interventions to enhance knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, and behaviors. Questionnaires will be completed pre, immediately post, and 4 mo (booster) for efficacy; evaluations completed at 6 mo, 12 mo, 18 mo, and 24 mo post intervention in both groups to document EOL care when a life threatening medical crisis occurs related to CPR, MV or TF. Lay teachers (n = 8) will be trained to demonstrate feasibility for a community-based model to continue the EduAct program after completion of the study. Specific aims are to: Aim 1. Compare the effect of the EduAct and attention control interventions on HCPs': (a) knowledge (dementia, CPR, MV, TF); (b) self-efficacy about EOL care plans; (c) intentions to write an EOL care plan and (d) behavior (written EOL care plan). Controlling for pretest values and selected covariates, we hypothesize that at all time points the EduAct group will have more: (a) knowledge, (b) self-efficacy, (c) intentions and (d) behaviors (primary outcome) than the control group. Aim 2. Compare the HCPs' immediate posttest written care plan and the care provided within 2 years when any life- threatening medical crisis occurred related to CPR, MV, and TF (exploratory aim). We hypothesize that significantly more EduAct group dementia victims will receive CPR, MV, or TF treatments consistent with the immediate posttest written care plan than the control group. Aim 3. Determine the feasibility of training lay teachers to deliver the EduAct program. Feasibility is defined as retention of lay teachers, fidelity of program delivery, self-efficacy to deliver the program, and intention to deliver future programs. We expect to retain at least 50% of the lay teachers who will deliver it with high fidelity, and report high self-efficacy and intention to delver the program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We developed an education program on dementia, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, tube feeding and mechanical ventilation for family caregivers' of relatives with dementia. The program is designed for caregivers to make the best end of life treatment decisions prior to a medical emergency. We will test the program to determine if works in a church setting and determine if lay teachers can conduct the program after the study is completed.",Community-based End-of-life Intervention for African American Dementia Caregivers,9085182,R01AG043485,"['advanced directive ', ' Advance Directives ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Enteral Feeding ', ' tube feeding ', ' gastric feeding ', ' feeding tube ', ' enteric feeding ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Site ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' satisfaction ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Proxy ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Mental Suffering ', ' Anguish ', ' Reporting ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Medical emergency ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' treatment choice ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,323770,0.028380527326962716
"Role of midlife cardiovascular disease on Alzheimer’s Pathology and cerebrovascular reactivity in the young-old. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to the presence of cardiovascular disease (CaVD), understanding the relationship between amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and CaVD is critically important. The overarching goal of this study is to further the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology, including Aβ and tau pathology and neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular reactivity and midlife CaVD. To achieve these goals, we will utilize a group non-demented participants from an existing cohort from the ongoing community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with a cohort of 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years at study entry and has collected a wealth of longitudinal vascular measures. We hypothesize that subclinical CaVD identified in midlife is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease pathology expressed as amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration. These changes in brain structure would be associated with alterations in cognition both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We further hypothesize that the change in cognition will result from a failure of vascular compensatory responses, marked by increases in regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CaVD) are two of the most common disorders of aging, understanding the relationship between the pathologies of these two disorders is critically important.

"Pathways to Brain Health for African Americans: A Community-Based Participatory Research Study PROJECT SUMMARY  The proposed studies will use community-based participatory research methods to investigate (1) the relative contributions of different modifiable health and lifestyle factors to age-related cognitive decline in African Americans, and (2) identify early predictors of cognitive decline and conversion to aMCI and AD, and understand how the health and lifestyle behaviors influence risk for subsequent cognitive decline. Older African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss, being twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) as white Americans. While this may be due to various modifiable health and lifestyle factors, little is known about their relative importance (and interactions) specifically for African Americans. To investigate these questions, the proposed work will involve partnerships with churches, senior centers, public housing, the African-American community of Newark, and the State of New Jersey.  We will recruit 240 African Americans age 55 and above, who will be tested at two time points, once at baseline and two years later. Half of these participants (120) will receive brain imaging (structural, resting state and diffusion tensor) and a third of the participants (80) will participate in a one-week home-based monitoring of sleep, activity, and movement. The initial cross-sectional analysis (Aim 1) will characterize the behavioral, biological, and physical correlates of brain health, in order to understand the relative contributions of different modifiable health and lifestyle factors (stress, sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyles, poor cardiovascular fitness, depressive symptoms, high body mass), education, social support and genetics, to age-related cognitive decline in African Americans. This will lead up to the longitudinal analysis (Aim 2) will determine the cognitive assessments and underlying brain changes that differentiate normal aging, aMCI, and AD and how these changes are modulated by health and lifestyle factors, education and genetics.  Overall, there is a dearth of data on the various factors which influence individual differences in cognitive resilience among older African Americans, especially for those living on low incomes and in public housing. Our study attempts to resolve this issue by examining the cognitive, neural, and lifestyle factors associated with cognitive resilience and, conversely, those that predict early cognitive decline in older African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  With this R01 proposal for “Pathways to Brain Health in African Americans: A Community-Based Participatory Research Study” the African-American Brain Health Initiative (AABHI) at Rutgers University- Newark seeks to investigate (1) the relative contributions of different modifiable health and lifestyle factors to age-related cognitive decline in African Americans, and (2) identify early predictors of cognitive decline and conversion to aMCI and AD, and understand how the health and lifestyle behaviors influence risk for subsequent cognitive decline. Older African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss, having double the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) as white Americans. While this is most likely due to environmental, lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as stress, sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyles, and poor cardiovascular fitness, little is known about their relative importance (and interactions) specifically for African Americans. Overall, there is a dearth of data on the various factors which influence individual differences in cognitive resilience among older African Americans, especially for those living on low incomes and in public housing.

"Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): India, the second-most populous country in the world, will soon experience rapid aging of its population. By 2050, India's older population (> 60 years old) is projected to reach 320 million (about the current size of the entire US population), representing an increase from 8 to 20 percent of its total population. The growing number of older people will drive a large increase in the prevalence of dementia in India, far exceeding the capacity of the private care system that currently predominates for the elderly. The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), a survey of 50,000 Indians representative of the older population across the nation and within its states and union territories, provides a unique opportunity to examine this and related issues. LASI is the most ambitious nationally representative study of the physical, mental, economic, and social well-being of the country's older population. Harmonized with other Health and Retirement Study (HRS) surveys, it offers an evidence base that can be used to compare the effects of social policies aimed at supporting older persons in India with policies used in other countries around the world. The objective of the proposed research is to supplement the current LASI in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in India. Previous efforts to identify dementia in developing nations have typically relied on non- representative samples in geographically restricted regions. In this application, we aim to develop a protocol for the assessment of dementia and MCI to be used within community settings in the ongoing, nationally representative LASI. To do so, we will first conduct in-depth cognitive testing for a sub-sample of LASI respondents at regional geriatric hospitals in India. Specifically, we will administer two leading dementia assessment protocols - the HRS Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) and the 10/66 Dementia Protocol - to approximately 2,000 respondents at least 60 years of age and stratified by their Wave 1 cognition test results, as well as their proximity to collaborating regional geriatic hospitals where the assessments will occur. Based on prognostic evaluation of the protocols, we will develop a short (15-minute) dementia assessment module and administer it in Wave 2 to persons with a high probability of having dementia and MCI as well as to the 2,000 persons participating in the earlier assessment. Using these data, we will estimate prevalence rates of dementia and MCI in India for the population and sub-populations. We will provide to the research community data generated from the in-depth cognitive testing at regional geriatric hospitals and from the administration of the short dementia assessment module during Wave 2, both linked to the on-going LASI main survey. Our harmonized protocol for dementia and MCI assessment will enable researchers to make comparisons with prior findings in India using the 10/66 protocol as well as to conduct cross-country studies with the United States, England, China, and other countries that implement the HRS HCAP protocol. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide a means for estimating the prevalence of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment for India that can be adapted to other harmonized surveys of aging in developing countries. The longitudinal nature of the project will provide insight on deterioration of cognitive abilities among the aged over time. The generated data will help researchers and policymakers determine the costs and burdens associated with providing care for older persons with diminished cognitive abilities.",Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI),9307615,R01AG051125,"['Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' social situation ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Physical Performance ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Castes ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration / HMO ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospitals ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Social Policies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' Sister ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Venous ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,86000,0.09824972097763647
"Role of midlife cardiovascular disease on Alzheimer’s Pathology and cerebrovascular reactivity in the young-old. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to the presence of cardiovascular disease (CaVD), understanding the relationship between amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and CaVD is critically important. The overarching goal of this study is to further the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology, including Aβ and tau pathology and neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular reactivity and midlife CaVD. To achieve these goals, we will utilize a group non-demented participants from an existing cohort from the ongoing community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with a cohort of 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years at study entry and has collected a wealth of longitudinal vascular measures. We hypothesize that subclinical CaVD identified in midlife is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease pathology expressed as amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration. These changes in brain structure would be associated with alterations in cognition both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We further hypothesize that the change in cognition will result from a failure of vascular compensatory responses, marked by increases in regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CaVD) are two of the most common disorders of aging, understanding the relationship between the pathologies of these two disorders is critically important. The goal of this study is to furthe the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology and midlife CaVD. We will utilize a group 80 participants with a wealth of existing CaVD data from the Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years.

"The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study Project Summary Identification of successful prevention and treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has remained elusive, partially because clinical symptoms of AD have a late presentation in disease development, but also because there are not clear targets directly related to AD neuropathology for which definitive treatment is available. Thus, focusing on possible treatment and prevention targets that can be identified well before onset of clinical disease and which are known to be treatable is critical in addressing AD. The vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia, including AD, offers an important opportunity for prevention and treatment. Further, evidence suggests that vascular risk factors, including hypertension and diabetes, as well as brain cerebrovascular changes (i.e. white matter hyperintensities), contribute most to the development of cognitive decline and dementia when they are present in midlife (well before clinical AD usually presents). Some of this evidence has been established by the ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a community-based biracial cohort study of individuals from four US communities, with nearly 30 years of vascular risk factors and marker data, and its primary ancillary study, the ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC- NCS). The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study, the renewal of which is being proposed in this application, built on the valuable data available in ARIC and ARIC-NCS. By focusing on brain amyloid- deposition, which in leading hypotheses is responsible for the development of AD, the ARIC-PET study further evaluated the associations between midlife vascular risk factors and AD. In the initial phase of this study, we completed 347 brain amyloid PET scans, using florbetapir PET, among participants from three ARIC sites. We found higher rates of brain amyloid in participants who were older, female, carried an APOE 4 allele (the primary genetic risk factor for AD), and who were of black race. Although our data did not support a general association between midlife vascular risk factors and brain amyloid, for persons with “two hits”: a high genetic risk (carriers of an APOE 4 allele) and elevated midlife vascular risk, our data do suggest more brain amyloid deposition. Finally, our data suggest that cognition is worse among participants who have both elevated brain amyloid and high amounts of brain cerebrovascular disease, on MRI. This renewal application proposes a repeat brain MRI and florbetapir (amyloid) PET scan among all surviving non-demented participants of ARIC-PET, to evaluate how vascular risk factors and brain subclinical vascular changes and APOE genotype each contribute to the progression of brain amyloid as well as the progression of clinical cognitive status, including conversion to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Further, we will evaluate progression of brain cerebrovascular changes as a risk factor for progression of brain amyloid and clinical cognitive status, which we hypothesize may provide a critical link to explain some of our observed racial disparities in amyloid deposition rates. The ARIC-PET cohort provides unique data in a biracial sample; data from its renewal could identify important targets for prevention. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that vascular risk factors play a major role in the development of dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET Amyloid imaging study used PET scans to further understand the role of vascular disease in Alzheimer’s, and the studies proposed in this renewal will test how change in vascular disease relates to change in brain amyloid and cognition.

"A non-pharmacological intervention for patients with Alzheimer s disease and family caregivers Abstract An increasing number of adults in the U.S. provide care to someone aged 50+ years with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alzheimer's disease is a devastating illness affecting patients, family members and society. There is a need to identify interventions that decrease the cognitive and functional manifestations of the condition in the patient and the negative consequences experienced by family caregivers. Evidence suggests that non- pharmacological intervention approaches can be beneficial to both caregivers and AD patients. However, most intervention programs have exclusively focused on the caregiver or the patient, despite emerging evidence of a reciprocal interaction between the dyad. Also, most caregiver programs have targeted caregivers of patients in the moderate to severe stages of the illness. In addition, cognitive interventions for individuals with AD have been dependent on facility based training approaches, which limit feasibility and cost effectiveness.  The proposed study will develop and test the efficacy and feasibility of a dyadic-based intervention program (DT), delivered through state-of-the art computer tablet technology. A novel feature of the investigation is its focus on both the caregiver and the recipient of care (person with AD) and the integration of an evidenced- based caregiver intervention and evidenced-based cognitive/functional training for the care recipient. The program will be tailored for the caregiver and emphasize issues important to caregivers, not only in the earlier stages of caregiving, but will also target issues across the caregiving trajectory to help prepare the caregiver for changes in their role. The cognitive/functional training will be targeted to the needs of the care recipient. The DT intervention will be 6 months in duration and compared to a control condition (CC) that combines standard a nutrition intervention for the caregiver and mental stimulation exercises for care recipient. Two hundred and forty Hispanic, African American and White/Caucasian dyads will be randomized to the DT intervention or CC condition. Measures at baseline and the 6 and 12-month follow-ups will include indices of care recipient cognitive and functional status, and caregiver outcomes such as; quality of life, distress, and caregiving efficacy. Information will also be gathered on ethnic differences in response to the intervention and estimates of cost effectiveness of the intervention. The DT intervention is highly innovative given the focus on a dyadic approach, the use of state-of-the-art technology for intervention delivery, a community-based and stage-model approach to intervention development, the inclusion of the caregiver as a therapy extender and cultural tailoring of the program. Narrative The proposed study is extremely relevant to public health concerns. The prevalence of individuals with AD and family caregivers is projected to increase in the upcoming decades. To address this pressing issue, the focus of the proposed study is to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of an innovative intervention program, delivered through state-of-the art computer tablet technology that targets both ethnically/culturally diverse family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD patients. The program augments an evidenced-based caregiver intervention with an evidenced-based cognitive/functional training intervention for the patient. The overall goals of the project are to improve the lives of family caregivers; the ability of caregivers to provide care to their loved ones; to improve the lives of individuals with AD; and to reduce disparities in access to needed services and support among caregiver and patient populations.",A non-pharmacological intervention for patients with Alzheimer s disease and family caregivers,9339479,R01AG054009,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Maintenance ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Training Technique ', ' Training Technics ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' cognitive training ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' loved ones ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,708293,0.10554868491582454
"Racial Disparities in the Health of Caregivers for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease Over the past 50 years, health and functional status of the American population has continued to improve but these improvements have not been equally distributed across races, ethnicities and socioeconomic groups. Perhaps nowhere is the challenge to reduce health disparities more apparent than in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. Risk of AD is higher among ethnic minorities, and because many public and private insurers do not cover institutionalized or paid home health care services that individuals with these diseases require, the burdens faced by family caregivers from diverse racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds is high. The goals of this project are two-fold. First, we will estimate predictive models of cognitive decline, AD onset, other health and functional status changes of middle age and older Americans. We model caregiving for person with AD and analyze and quantify how health and other indicators of well being evolve over the life course for caregivers of family members with AD and contribute to health disparities. Second, we will utilize a dynamic micro simulation model of health, cognitive decline and economic outcomes to quantify health of future populations and burden of AD across diverse groups. Our ability to achieve the proposed aims is enhanced by use of the best data sets available for this research and that are established NIH-funded longitudinal cohorts: the Health and Retirement Study and its sub-study the Aging Demographics and Memory Study. It is further enhanced by a team of researchers with expertise in both dementia and microsimulation. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is high and growing and its impact is not equally distributed across races, ethnicities and socioeconomic groups. We propose to analyze the burden of AD and its impact on family caregivers from diverse backgrounds. We will estimate the life course trajectories of health changes, cognitive and functional decline and AD onset of middle age and older Americans across racial and ethnic groups. We will analyze how well being diverges for caregivers of persons with AD and how it contribute to health disparities.

"17-beta-estradiol protects critical hippocampal synaptic circuits during asymptomatic disease in the novel TgF344-AD rat Project Summary This proposal aims to determine mechanisms by which the neuroprotective hormone 17-estradiol (E2) improves and maintains hippocampal synaptic signaling during presymtomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology using the novel comprehensive TgF344-AD rat model. The earliest and most insidious stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are characterized by altered brain function at the level of the synapse. Patholgoy begins in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and spreads via functionally connected synapse to the hippocampus. Both brain regions are critical to learning and memory. As soluble toxic species of amyloid beta oligomers and hyper-phosphorylated tau rise, EC-to- hippocampal synaptic weakening results and occurs decades prior to clinical presentation of cognitive symptoms. Ovarian hormones play a delicate role in modulating synaptic circuits and cognitive function. Rapid loss of ovarian hormones as a natural part aging in women is now recognized as a risk factor for the development of AD. 17-estradiol (E2) and its replacement post-menopause benefits neuron function, amyloid and tau pathology, and cognition, yet how E2 improves or maintains synaptic processes underlying cognitive function throughout early asymptomatic and symptomatic disease progression are unknown. Our lab has established that E2-enhanced hippocampal synaptic strength and cognitive performance, in non- diseased rodents, is due to its ability to increase synaptic current mediated by glutamate receptor subunit epsilon- 2 (GluN2B) –containing N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Current evidence in presymptomatic transgenic rodent models show early hippocampal synaptic deficits result from loss of beneficial synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs transmission, while extrasynaptically located GluN2B-NMDARs are pathologically stimulated due to excessive extracellular glutamate. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that E2 is beneficial to synaptic function in early AD by enhancing synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR current and synaptic strength in the dentate gyrus, the primary target region of synaptic projections from EC. Data obtained in this proposal will bolster previous evidence of E2’s neuroprotective actions against Alzheimer’s disease pathology as well as establish novel therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) targets the entorhinal cortex in the earliest phase of the disease. Although more women than men are diagnosed with AD, likely due to loss of estrogen in menopause, little is known regarding how it protects synaptic function during disease progression. Using the novel TgF344-AD rat model, proposed studies investigate beneficial effects of estrogen on dentate gyrus function during presymptomatic disease.",17-beta-estradiol protects critical

"The UCSF Brain Health Assessment for the Detection of Cognitive Impairment Among Diverse Populations in Primary Care Efficient and user-friendly neurocognitive screens are needed that are sensitive to the variety of neurocognitive disorder presentations to primary care. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment was developed to efficiently measure the cognitive domains that can be affected in the earliest stages of neurocognitive decline, including memory, executive functions / speed, visuospatial skills, language, behavior, and function. Four subtests and an optional informant survey are administered via an appealing tablet interface and with automated scoring and provider feedback. Preliminary validation studies indicate excellent combined sensitivity and specificity to cognitive impairment among English-speaking older adults with moderate to high levels of education. The primary goals of the proposed work are to optimize and validate the BHA for older adults who are diverse in terms of education and language spoken, to perform cross-validation studies of other paradigms funded by this award, and to evaluate and address barriers to detecting cognitive impairment in primary care. Education and English as a second language each impact cognitive test performance and are barriers to accurate detection of cognitive impairment. This project will address these health disparities by including persons with diverse levels of education and persons whose primary language is Spanish, Mandarin, or Cantonese in both validation and implementation studies. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed English-speaking older adults with low, moderate, or high education. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed Spanish-, Cantonese-, or Mandarin-speaking older adults. In Aim 3, we will identify and address implementation challenges in primary care practices that serve patients diverse in terms of education and language spoken. If successful, this project will lead to increased detection of cognitive impairment in everyday community settings, which is essential to enable differential diagnosis and to improve medical management for people with cognitive impairment, including dementia, in the United States. Early detection of neurocognitive disorders is highly beneficial for patients and families, yet cognitive impairment and dementia are frequently under-recognized. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment is designed to rapidly detect cognitive impairment in primary care and other everyday clinical settings. The proposed research will establish the feasibility of this assessment to increase cognitive impairment detection rates among patients with different levels of education and who speak English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin.",The UCSF Brain Health Assessment for the Detection of Cognitive Impairment Among Diverse Populations in Primary Care,9482389,UG3NS105557,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Data Collection ', ' delirious ', ' Delirium ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Paste substance ', ' Pastes ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Educational Materials ', ' International ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Visuospatial ', ' visual spatial ', ' user-friendly ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' stability testing ', ' Secure ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' neurocognitive disorder ', ' brain health ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UG3,2017,864158,0.06461973498189376
"Whole Genome Sequencing in Ethnically Diverse Cohorts for the ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) PROJECT SUMMARY  The Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national sequencing initiative focused on identifying genetic risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in an effort to identify new pathways for prevention and new targets for drug development. The projects’ discovery phase included whole exome sequencing (WES) of 10,914 unrelated cases (N=5,778) and controls (N=5,136) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,019 familial samples. A majority of these samples are non-Hispanic white (NHW) in origin, making the addition of ethnically diverse samples to the study critical to identification of both shared and novel genetic risk factors for AD between populations. This ethnic diversity was emphasized in the ‘ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) Phase’ planning stage with a directive that additional existing cohorts with unrelated AD cases that ‘encompass the richest possible ethnic diversity’ be given the highest priority for inclusion.  To fulfill the goals of this RFA and this FUS Phase Mandate, this proposal identifies seven existing elderly cohorts of African-American (AA) and pan-HI ancestry with a total of 10,430 samples (N=2,322 AA AD cases and 1,843 AA controls and 2,928 Hispanic AD cases and 2,875 Hispanic controls) for WGS and processing in collaboration with existing NIH-funded AD infrastructure. Combining these cohorts with existing African America (AA) and Hispanic (HI) sequencing from the Washington Heights-Hamilton Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the ADSP will provide large ethnically diverse datasets for both validation of ADSP discovery phase findings and discovery of novel risk and/or protective variants for AD. Importantly, these data will allow for admixture mapping, a powerful method of gene mapping for diseases that show differential risk by ancestry, by comparing allele frequency differences between populations. They will also become an invaluable resource for the AD research community at-large, and will help to address the health disparities that contribute to AA and HI populations having higher rates of AD than NHW. Thus, we will address these important issues by creating a large dataset of AA and pan-HI AD cases and controls for study.  Specifically we propose to: 1) increase the ethnic diversity of the ADSP by assembling samples from existing cohorts with AA and HI AD cases and controls; 2) collaborate with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) in assemblage, storage, and distribution of DNA on these cohorts; 3) generating genome-wide SNP array data and WGS for all collected samples; and 4) collaborate with the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) in processing, quality controls, storage and distribution of the final datasets. Our overall goal is to enhance the discovery of AD risk factors by facilitating research on AD in ethnically diverse datasets.

"Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease progression; and amyloid- directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD. For ~10 years, the Principal Investigator has conducted studies on the effects of fitness adaptation on cardiovascular (CV) health. Recently, he received 2 years of funding to examine the effects of 3-times/week 6-month aerobic exercise-training on cognition in the laboratory setting. This ongoing study has allowed the Principal Investigator to demonstrate the ability to recruit, enroll, test, collect and manage related neuroimaging pilot data in a predominantly AA sample. While such a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation, such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of cognitive deterioration. To logically extend this ongoing work, he seeks to initiate an 18-month study, testing real-life applicability o the effects of exercise adaptation on memory in a more ideal community setting. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach will bolster retention. The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up) aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. We will test our hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and 2.) stretch-exercise (control). We proposed that the aerobic-exercise group will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, we will determine whether training- induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain volume. Explanatorily, we will also investigate intervention effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1α) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition. A team of experienced investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations supported by DCOA), we will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the aerobic-exercise group will follow a  prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using appropriate multivariate methods. While we remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of our ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 8 months) and therefore allow for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures; test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory. Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical, psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia constituting ~2/3 of all late-life cases. Based on 2011 estimates, the annual health care cost for dementia is ~$183 billion. Given this staggering cost, and the projected increase in elderly population by the year 2030, identifying effective mechanisms to ward off structural and functional declines associated with AD is an important public health goal as evidenced by recent presidential initiatives (reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for, persons with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease). Unfortunately, this  well-intended public health goal cannot be achieved without an effective dementia preventive strategy. Fortunately, lifestyle-induced preservation of intellectual dexterity among those showing earliest symptoms of cognitive deterioration may ameliorate the physical, emotional, and economic burden associated with loss of cognitive vitality. If proven and properly directed in African Americans, such intervention can further reduce health disparity.","Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach",9277339,R01AG045058,"['Aerobic fitness ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' ApoE ', ' Apo-E ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cerebral Tissue Hypoxia ', ' Cerebral Hypoxia ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Anticholinesterases ', ' Anticholinesterase Drugs ', ' Anticholinesterase Agents ', ' Anti-Cholinesterases ', ' Cholinesterase Inhibitors ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research ABSTRACT Despite experiencing Alzheimer’s-related health problems at a disproportionate rate, African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Insufficient enrollment of African Americans in this line of research is a nationally-recognized problem. This is highly concerning not only because of the need for unbiased, representative samples in basic science and clinical research, but also because involving persons from underrepresented minority groups is crucial to advancing our understanding of, and ultimately combating, health disparities. In response to PAR-15- 349 “Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease”, we propose to develop and evaluate a novel strategy that uses a storytelling campaign to enhance recruitment of African American adults into research at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center. In Specific Aim 1, we will build on our promising pilot work to refine and evaluate community members’ acceptance of a storytelling strategy for communicating Alzheimer’s-related research participation experiences of African Americans in mid and late life. The storytelling strategy will highlight African Americans’ research participation narratives, as derived from a series of ethnographic interviews and told using short videos. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the effect of this storytelling strategy on recruitment of African Americans into ADRD research. Videos developed in Aim 1 will be incorporated into all existing ADRC recruitment efforts, ranging from community events to social media strategies. The primary outcome for Aim 2 will be the proportion of African Americans recruited to the ADRC Clinical Core over an 18 month period, with the preceding 18 month period serving as the comparator. Specific Aim 3 will use path analysis modeling to explore the mechanisms by which a storytelling strategy increases enrollment of African Americans into ADRD research in general, and into a specific study designed to address health disparities. Realizing the goals of this study will increase racial and ethnic diversity in ADRD research at a leading NIA-funded ADRC and ultimately, help to reduce cognitive health disparities amongst African Americans. Findings from this study will directly inform best practices for increasing diversity within the national AD Centers network, with significant implications for a range of underrepresented populations. Furthermore, these findings will also have applications in other disease contexts in which scientific progress is constrained by insufficient recruitment of persons from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups. This project will examine how a strategy called storytelling may help to increase research participation among persons of African American ethnicity. The project will focus on recruitment to research studies related to Alzheimer’s disease, which is particularly important because 1) Alzheimer’s poses a substantial threat to public health, 2) African Americans experience Alzheimer’s-related health problems at disproportionately high rates compared to non-Hispanic whites, and 3) , African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Findings from this study will inform best practices for recruitment throughout the NIA-funded national network of Alzheimer Disease Research Centers, and resources developed through this project will be shared accordingly.",Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research,9381193,R01AG054518,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Awareness ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' health economics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' combat ', ' primary outcome ', ' social media ', ' Caregiver support ', ' Care giver support ', ' dementia care ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' relative cost ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,448791,0.10309370202789803
"Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral Vascular Disease in American Indians - Diversity Supplement Resubmission DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AIs) experience a disproportionately high incidence of cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) relative to non-Indians with twice the stroke rate of the general US population. Neuroimaging techniques have shown CBVD-related brain abnormalities to be associated with disruption of neurpsychological performance. Therapy for post-stroke cognitive impairment has been challenging. Cognitive therapy involves intense, focused, regular mental activity, intellectual stimulation, and behaviora exercises that assist individuals to regain or maintain cognitive function. and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia after brain insult. Interactive Metronome (IM) therapy is a promising form of behavioral therapy for CBVD-related cognitive and motor function. This technology uses operant conditioning of an individual's responses through simple, repetitive motor tasks (e.g., clapping hands, tapping feet) in time with a set beat. Through visual and auditory feedback, IM addresses processing speed, attention, and immediate and delayed memory, all of which can be affected by CBVD. IM therapy can improve quality of life, physical mobility, gait, and CBVD- related cognitive deficits. The ongoing Strong Heart Stroke Study (SHSS) (1R01HL093086-01A1; Dedra Buchwald, PI) is investigating CBVD-related brain abnormalities through MRI scans on 1000 AIs from the original SHS cohort. The proposed study will capitalize on this current SHSS to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to ascertain the effects of a culturally tailored IM intervention on cognition, depression, and quality of life. We ill target SHSS participants with subclinical CVBD defined by impaired cognitive processing speed. We will select a sample of 180 American Indians age 68 to 80 years participating in the SHSS. The specific Aims for this study of older American Indians are as follows: 1) Determine if the culturally-adapted IM intervention can improve cognitive functioning among older AIs with CBVD; and 2) Estimate the impact of IM on health-related quality of life. This study will yield important insights into the relationships among cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and brain abnormalities that can inform treatment efforts as one way to reducing AI CBVD disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will further our knowledge of the relationships among of cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and CBVD-related brain abnormalities providing valuable direction for more effective screening, treatment, and prevention of CBVD-related cognitive impairment. Thus, this study has significant health disparities implications for American Indians who exhibit the highest rates of stroke and related risk factors.",Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral

"Life Course Process of Alzheimer's Disease: Sex Difference and Biosocial Mechanisms Abstract The proposed research addresses two fundamental problems in population research on the Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) sex disparities in cognitive decline with aging, and (2) interplay of social and biological pathways that generate and sustain AD disparities. Our proposal breaks new ground with an innovative life- course research design that conjoins prospective cohort data from five large-scale NIH population-based longitudinal studies that collectively cover the adult life span. We will conduct integrative data analysis in response to an increased demand for replicability of scientific findings across independent studies and make efficient use of extant resources in the pursuit of a cumulative science. We will apply novel statistical methods to model longitudinal sex differences in age trajectories of cognitive functioning from young to late adulthood and incidence of AD in old age. We will examine social and biological mechanisms influencing cognitive trajectories and sex differences. Tested mechanisms will include social stress related to socioeconomic status (SES) and social relationships, and biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic, neuroendocrine, and immune pathways implicated in AD. We will also test and integrate new biological data on immune function. Project Narrative The proposed project will examine the process of age change in cognitive function in relation to risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) throughout the adult life span and how such process is different for men and women. It seeks to better understand how social disadvantages such as low socioeconomic status and social isolation “get under the skin” to influence biological pathways to cognitive health as individuals age. It contributes new knowledge that is critical for identifying the life stages in which intervention might be most effective, targeting AD prevention and treatment in men and women, and informing

"Old SCHOOL Hip Hop: A randomized controlled trial to improve dementia knowledge Objectives: The goals of this proposal are to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel culturally- tailored dementia education intervention to a) teach young children to recognize dementia symptoms and demonstrate an appropriate action plan (which we have termed dementia literacy) and b) have these dementia literate children teach and improve dementia literacy their parents and grandparents. Background: Dementia is common among elderly individuals, becomes more prevalent with age, is medically refractory, reduces life expectancy, and diminishes quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Cultural barriers to dementia diagnosis exist and are potentially modifiable. Interventions that target younger generations may shift cultural perceptions and improve acceptance of dementia and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Emerging evidence suggests that early cognitive impairment may have modifiable or preventable components and a combination of medical and lifestyle interventions may delay or reduce cognitive decline, particularly when delivered early in the course of disease. Health literacy, including perceptions of cognitive aging and awareness of possible modifiable determinants, could be unrealized barriers to diminishing the health disparity of dementia. Youth education programs focused on dementia could increase community dementia awareness, improve AD literacy of parents and grandparents of dementia- literate children, shift cultural perceptions of AD to improve its acceptance, and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Such an approach could uniquely engage minority populations who are least engaged and at greatest risk for AD. Methods: The Intervention. “Old SCHOOL Hip Hop” (Seniors Can Have Optimal aging and Ongoing Longevity) is a validated model using a brief multimedia culturally tailored intervention designed to teach minority children key dementia signs and symptoms, and actions taken when dementia is recognized, which is early clinical evaluation by a physician. Twenty schools (with 3000 total students) will be randomly assigned to either the OSHH intervention arm or attentional control. This program will test the hypotheses that the program will lead to significant improvement of dementia knowledge in parents, and that gains are influenced by child knowledge, the degree of child-parent communication about the topic, and socioeconomic status. The program is additionally designed to create a novel, brief “dementia action test” to fulfill a critical missing tool for efficiently assessing dementia recognition and behavioral response. This project offers a unique opportunity effectively improve multigenerational community dementia knowledge in an era increasingly moving toward time-dependent multimodal disease modifying therapy. Our group's innovative model, pilot data, and recently completed and randomized controlled trial of a similar program in stroke support our approach and collective skill sets and experience providing an unparalleled opportunity to both meet project goals and establish several key steps to meaningfully impact dementia health literacy and potentially health outcomes including early access to care.",Old SCHOOL Hip Hop: A randomized controlled trial to improve dementia knowledge,9218495,R01AG054536,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior

"Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment among Mexican Americans PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this research is to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI): (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early detection and treatment. AD is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia and the 5th leading cause of death for those over 65 (8th leading cause of death for U.S. Hispanics). AD has an annual health care cost that is greater than that of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. While death rates from CVD and cancer have declined in recent decades, death rates have steadily increased for AD. The Mexican American elderly population is among the fastest growing segments of the population; however, little research on MCI and AD has been conducted among this underserved group. Here we will leverage our ongoing Health & Aging Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE) study to identify different pathways for MCI and AD among Mexican Americans, define subtle neuroanatomical and blood-based biomarker changes that are related to future risk of MCI and AD as well as provide evidence to support the utility of our AD blood-based detection tool that can be implemented in primary care settings. The current research team consists of leading experts in Mexican American cognitive aging, the epidemiology of MCI and AD as well as biomarkers of MCI and AD (neuroimaging and blood-based). The project will leverage a substantial existing infrastructure and HABLE cohort to address the two health disparities outlined above through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 - Examine the impact of higher rates of metabolic burden and depressive symptomatology on MCI and AD among community-dwelling Mexican Americans; Specific Aim 2 - Examine neuroimaging and blood-based biomarkers associated with MCI and AD among Mexican Americans; and Specific Aim 3: Validate our blood-based AD screening tool as the first-step in a multi-stage diagnostic process among Mexican Americans. The current project will address significant health disparities faced by Mexican American elders suffering from and at risk for MCI and AD. The identification of novel pathways related to disproportionate burden of diabetes and depression can lead to novel ethnic-specific interventions. The identification of a blood-based screening tool for AD will provide primary care providers a way of meeting the needs of a rapidly growing elderly Mexican American population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly growing number of patients suffering from Alzheimer's (AD), little work has been conducted on AD among Mexican Americans. Here we propose to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from AD (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early diagnosis methods. The relevance of this project is the identification of potentially different pathways to AD among Mexican Americans (directly related to increased rates of diabetes and depression and the health disparity of earlier age of onset) as well as the provision of a blood-based screening tool for AD that can be implemented in primary care clinics.",Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild

"Chronic Stressors, Brain Vasculature, and Cognitive Function in African-American Women PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this project is to determine whether and how chronic psychosocial stressors might contribute to pre-clinical correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke in African-American women at midlife. It is well documented that older African-Americans have significantly higher rates of AD and stroke than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. However, in most studies of individuals over age 65, these disparities are already present, suggesting that factors responsible for the disparity occur much earlier in life. As the field has shifted to understanding the earliest changes in cognitive aging, the proposed project provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate novel risk factors for adverse brain health in a recently funded study of vascular aging in African-American women aged 35-45. We will recruit a subsample of 100 African- American women of varying educational backgrounds from the parent study reporting high and low levels of chronic stress, respectively (N=50 from each group). Validated questionnaires will be utilized to measure overall chronic stress as well as chronic stressors known to be common among African-American women (i.e. discrimination, financial strain, neighborhood stressors and inadequate emotional support). Primary aims will compare high vs. low stress women on 1) measures of brain structure and vasculature (e.g. hippocampal volume and corticol thickness, microvascular disease, cerebral blood flow) using state of the art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques; as well as 2) cognitive function, using a brief neuropsychological battery. We will also examine whether established (nocturnal blood pressure, arterial stiffness) and novel (regenerative capacity) markers of overall vascular risk impact these outcomes among African-American women in the target age range. The overall objective of this R21 project is to obtain effect sizes for a larger, prospective, R01- funded study. The long-term goal of this program of research is to understand the impact of and pathways through which chronic stress contributes to risk for AD and stroke in an understudied, yet vulnerable group of women. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-Americans bear a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke compared to Whites, and vascular disease has emerged as one important pathway through which African-American “race” impacts AD and stroke in later life. “Midlife” represents a critical window for early prevention among African- Americans, particularly African-American women, as recent data indicate that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of vascular disease that are higher than those of other race-sex groups. The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether chronic stressors known to impact African-American women contribute to pre-clinical correlates of AD and stroke at midlife in this at-risk subgroup.","Chronic Stressors, Brain Vasculature, and Cognitive Function in African-American Women",9308575,R21AG055995,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Parents ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stress ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Woman ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Physical activity ', ' cerebrovasculature ', ' cerebral vasculature ', ' cerebral blood vessel ', ' brain vasculature ', ' Cerebrovascular system ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' Funding ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Hour ', ' psychosocial ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' artery stiffness ', ' artery stiffening ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' sex ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Cognitive aging ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' regenerative ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' brain health ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,312000,-0.0370574763794835
"Race/ethnic disparities and the incidence and over- or under-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY At the national level, there has been significant interest in addressing U.S. health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Although there is growing evidence to suggest race/ethnic disparities in dementia exists in the U.S., much of the evidence of disparities is indirect or comes from geographically- localized studies that may not be generalizable to the experience of Americans as a whole. Furthermore, there is little evidence to indicate whether disparities are widening or shrinking over time. Thus, the aims of this proposal are to (1) describe race/ethnic disparities in the incidence of experiencing Alzheimer's disease and related dementia at the national level in the U.S. and examine the extent to which race/ethnic disparities in incidence have changed over time, and (2) describe race/ethnic disparities in over- or under-diagnosis of prevalent Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the medical setting at the national level in the U.S. and examine the extent to which race/ethnic disparities in under- or over-diagnosis have changed over time. To accomplish these aims, we will use data from the nationally representative U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), and linked Medicare data. For Aim 1, we will build on previous work creating algorithms to predict dementia status from ADAMS using only HRS data (ADAMS participants are sampled from HRS) in order to create an improved algorithm with optimal validity across and within race/ethnic groups. We will then apply this algorithm to assign dementia status to each eligible HRS participant at each HRS interview. From this we will derive age-standardized estimates of dementia incidence in HRS by race/ethnic group (self-reported non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic) over two time periods, 1998-2004 and 2006-2012. For Aim 2, we will use Medicare claims data to determine whether each eligible HRS participant had a diagnosis of dementia prior to or within 1 year after each HRS interview. We will then estimate agreement between the Medicare-based and algorithmic dementia diagnosis assigned at each HRS interview from 1998 to 2012 within race/ethnic groups to quantify disparities and temporal trends in over- or under-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. This contribution is expected to be significant as it will provide (i) national and historical benchmarks against which to compare current and future data on local race/ethnic disparities in both the incidence and over- or under- diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; (ii) evidence summarizing temporal changes in race/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; (iii) improved algorithms for diagnosis of dementia in HRS that maximize validity in minority populations; and (iv) evidence for the feasibility of linking of multiple data sources to provide valid estimates of race/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the U.S. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study represents a critical first step towards addressing race/ethnic health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the U.S, as until we can quantify the extent of the problem and understand how it has changed with time, we cannot hope to adequately address it. Ultimately, the proposed work will inform future efforts to develop a national monitoring system for race/ethnic health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",Race/ethnic disparities and the incidence and over- or under-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the United States,9288446,R03AG055485,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Planning ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' effective intervention ', ' Medicare claim ', ' health data ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' ']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,79750,0.17218762450730835
"A Culturally-Relevant Approach to Reducing Dementia Caregiver Stress in an Underserved Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans currently are the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S., thus, the number of Asian Americans with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers will also increase. Surprisingly, very little intervention work has focused on addressing caregiver needs in this population. Specifically, a large gap exists in the development of interventions to reduce caregiver stress and little is known about how cultural diversity impacts caregiver stress and intervention outcomes. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will give Dr. Meyer the skills, training, and mentoring necessary to conduct community-engaged interventions to reduce the burden of AD in culturally diverse family caregivers. The proposed mentored research activities for this K01 award are to refine and pilot test a theoretically-informed, culturally-relevant, community-based intervention informed by sociocultural stress and coping and social contextual models to reduce distress and enhance well-being in Vietnamese American dementia caregivers. By focusing on this large and underserved population, this K01 application is consistent with NIA Research Goal E: Improve our ability to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults. It als responds to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) to involve more racially/ethnically diverse older adults in research and to develop effective services to support ethnically diverse families. This application includes experiential and research activities in three critical areas fo Dr. Meyer's career development: (1) knowledge of AD and associated dementias (e.g., risk factors, assessment and diagnosis, course) and cognitive impairment and how they affect families, (2) methodological skills and cultural knowledge to conduct community-engaged intervention research, including formal training in aspects of community-based participatory research (e.g. mixed methods) and enhanced knowledge of Vietnamese culture and language, and (3) theoretical and methodological skills necessary to design, implement, and analyze scientifically rigorous interventions for culturally diverse populations (e.g., design issues, longitudinal data analysis). Mentored research training will occur in the context of a focused research project with two aims: (1) Refine and manualize a culturally- informed intervention to reduce distress and enhance well-being in Vietnamese dementia caregivers, and (2) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Completion of the proposed research and career development activities will generate data to inform the development of an R34 or R21 application and provide Dr. Meyer with the experience necessary to transition from observational/ descriptive to community-based intervention work. Dr. Meyer will leverage existing resources and expertise at three NIH-funded centers at UC Davis: the Alzheimer's disease Center, the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, and the Clinical and Translational Science Center. These resources, along with the mentoring team's strong, collaborative relationships with local community-based organizations will provide an enriched environment that will help Dr. Meyer to be a successful and independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the number of Asian Americans rapidly grows, so too will the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers. Caregivers of persons with AD suffer a substantial burden emotionally, physically, and financially, and this may be especially true for immigrant and underserved Asians. The development of psychosocial interventions that address the diversity and complexity of caregiver distress in culturally diverse populations is a critical public health challenge.",A

"Race, Childhood Social Disadvantage, and the Adult Brain: HANDLS BRAINCHILD. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed career development plan is to launch the candidate's independent research career investigating the mechanisms by which racial disparities in exposure to early life social disadvantage (ELSD) promote accelerated subclinical and clinical brain pathology in African Americans (AA) across the life course. There are pronounced AA-White disparities in brain health endpoints including stroke, dementia, and cognitive decline. Recent data suggest that earlier disparities in brain health are also noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Exposure to greater ELSD - characterized by harsher residential and neighborhood environments and lower parental socioeconomic status (SES) - may chart a course towards an accelerated onset of and more severe brain pathology observed in AAs as characterized by multiple MRI-assessed indicators of subclinical brain pathology including lower gray matter (GM) volumes, greater white matter lesion volumes and lesser WM integrity. This application was originally submitted in response to the NIA K01 PAR- 09-136, ""Promoting Careers in Aging and Health Disparities Research"" that sought to delineate social factors that precipitate late life health disparities among minorities and elders from disadvantaged backgrounds. Due to discontinuation of that PAR, the current application is a resubmission to the NIA K01 PA-11-190, Mentored Research Scientist Development Award. This K01 will allow the candidate to extend her prior training on the relation of psychosocial factors to coronary heart disease risk among adolescent and early to midlife AAs by providing training in (1) the life course perspective and accelerated theories of aging, particularly as applied to racial disparities in social disadvantage and health, and (2) the brain and related vasculature, and MRI- indicators of brain pathology including subclinical cerebrovascular disease. The proposed project will be a substudy to the ongoing HANDLS SCAN project - itself an ancillary study to the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study, a 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the NIA Intramural Research Program that assesses health disparities in > 3,500 AA and White adults (ages 30-64 at baseline) living in Baltimore, MD. In up to 400 HANDLS participants, HANDLS SCAN examines the relations of race and adult SES to MRI-indicators of brain pathology that may underlie risk for stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline. In the proposed study, 300 HANDLS SCAN participants will complete measures of ELSD to determine: (1) whether ELSD is related to MRI-indicators of brain pathology predictive of future stroke, cognitive, and functional decline, and whether these associations are more pronounced in AAs than in White adults, and (2) explore potential psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical mediators of these associations. The interdisciplinary training outlined in this application will allow the candidate o carve out a unique and unmatched research program that is desperately warranted by the pronounced prevalence of cerebrovascular and other brain disease in AAs. The interrelations among life course social disadvantage, accelerated aging, and brain health endpoints have been grossly understudied and are crucial to developing appropriate prevention and intervention strategies geared toward reducing and ultimately eliminating race-related health disparities in brain aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pronounced racial disparities are observed across multiple clinical and subclinical brain health endpoints in African Americans compared to Whites and may be attributable, in part, to accelerated age-related disease processes. Great public health relevance lies in our ability to understand the relation of racial disparities in early life social disadvantage to subclinical markers of brain pathology predictive of future clinical endpoints such as stroke, dementia, and cognitive and physical decline in African Americans, and related multi-level mediators of this relation. Such research can facilitate development of appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in multiple brain health endpoints.","Race, Childhood Social Disadvantage, and the Adult Brain: HANDLS BRAINCHILD.",9280775,K01AG043581,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Cholesterol ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maryland ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) provides Georgia and the region with comprehensive clinical, research, and educational programs. This renewal application outlines our success in building an environment that encourages and supports innovative projects with a general theme of discovery and translation of new targets and mechanisms to enable early identification, early interventions, and ultimately prevention of AD. Given the well documented disparities in clinical research participation and burden of disease for AD in the African American community, the Emory ADRC focuses special effort to understand and address inter-individual differences in AD, ranging from ethno-racial factors to personal differences in genetic and protein variation. We benefit from generous institutional support from Emory, one of the nation's fastest growing research academic medical centers, the generous Atlanta community, and a highly collaborative team from more than 20 departments and centers. Five Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology, and Outreach Recruitment and Education), coordinate activities to effectively recruit, evaluate, and engage a diverse cohort of volunteers who actively participate in a wide variety of research studies that aim to better define the trajectory from normal cognitive aging to symptomatic stages of disease. Data from the Cores are captured and stored for distribution to local researchers and for national collaborations. Our biospecimen banks include well-characterized neuropathological case materials, blood and CSF, and DNA. These valuable resources are distributed widely for a variety of approved studies of genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and pathological investigations. The ADRC educational programs reach a broad audience of students, health care professionals, and the public. Three cutting edge research projects are closely integrated with ADRC Cores: Project 1, AD Biomarkers and Endothelial Dysfunction in Caucasians and African Americans, is a longitudinal biomarker study with full integration into the ADRC Clinical Core and OREC, leveraging a unique community based Registry for Remembrance to facilitate recruitment of African Americans; Project 2, A Proteogenomic Approach to Understanding AD GWAS Results, proposes to use state-of-the art targeted gene resequencing and mass spectrometer-based protein sequencing to advance understanding of genetic risk of AD by genetic loci by linking novel gene variants at 20+ recently identified loci directly with the encoded and expressed protein variants in AD brain in an allele specific manner; Project 3, Defining the Properties of Pathogenic Aβ strains in Alzheimer's Disease, takes an interdisciplinary approach to build on pioneering work showing AD brain extracts are transmissible in animal models, by investigating how structural differences in Aβ strains from asymptomatic vs. symptomatic stages of AD vary in their seeding and propagation in yeast and animal models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Emory ADRC has grown dramatically during the past funding cycles (years 6-10), and now seeks a 3rd renewal (years 11-15). The ADRC contributes to the NIH/NIA-funded network and plays a critical role in the coordinated response to the growing public health threat from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emory's active participation in the network fosters research to understand the causes, investigate novel targets and interventions that will lead to more effective treatments and prevention, and improve the treatment of affected individuals with AD and related conditions, and the well being of their family caregivers.",Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center,9330027,P50AG025688,"['University Medical

"Risk Factors for Stroke and Cognitive Decline in a Tri-Ethnic Region ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke, cognitive impairment and dementia are increasing public health problems with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The National Alzheimer's Project Act and the NIH have recommended more extensive studies on the risk and determinants of dementia in disparities populations. Elucidation of the relationships between traditional and novel vascular risk factors for stroke, dementia, cognitive impairment, and disability is critical to enhance our ability to modify the risk of these conditions. The Northern Manhattan Study consists of a population-based cohort of 3497 stroke-free adults who have been followed annually for a median of 13.9 years. This collaborative prospective cohort study among whites, blacks, and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community is an outstanding resource to address health disparities involving faculty across three institutions (Columbia University, University of Miami, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). The cohort is well characterized and the 1290 subjects among the MRI sub-cohort have had a standardized brain MRI and two neuropsychological assessments over 5 years. The new aims are to determine the relationship between cognitive trajectories and a novel neuro-immune and inflammatory biomarker panel; determine the relationship between brain imaging biomarkers (regional brain volumes, regional white matter lesion burden, hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, small dilated perivascular spaces, dolichoectasia) and cognitive trajectories and dementia; determine the risk and vascular determinants of dementia; characterize the vascular determinants of functional impairment, disability, and quality of life; and assess the relationship between novel risk factors and specific ischemic stroke subtypes. To accomplish these aims, subjects will continue to be followed annually by telephone to ascertain stroke, MI, death and change in cognitive status, and more extensive functional assessments will be collected. A third expanded in-person neuropsychological assessment will be done among the MRI subcohort and a dementia consensus conference will ascertain and classify dementia. Stored plasma at the time of MRI will be used to measure an innovative inflammatory and immune biomarker panel, and new MRI measures will be analyzed on the already collected brain MRIs. The strengths of this prospective cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of novel serum biomarkers and brain imaging biomarkers, and the expanded focus on comprehensive outcomes including cognitive trajectories, dementia, functional impairment, and ischemic stroke subtypes. The results of these studies will be instrumental in the design of intervention programs to prevent stroke and cognitive decline in diverse populations and be a valuable shared data resource. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and dementia are increasing public health problems with a larger impact on blacks and Hispanics. Results from studying new blood and brain imaging factors will be instrumental in proposing interventions to prevent stroke and dementia in minority populations.",Risk Factors for Stroke and Cognitive

"The Role of Physician Networks on Racial Disparities in Intensity of Care for Dementia Patients PROJECT SUMMARY    Alzheimer’s disease and other related dementias (ADRD) are widely acknowledged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older populations. There are racial disparities in prevalence, with older African-Americans being twice as likely as older whites of having ADRD, with more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Treatment intensity of people with ADRD is well documented to differ by race, including differences in health services received such as medication use and end of life care patterns. For example, African-Americans have 1.77 times the risk of having a feeding tube placed at the end of life than white patients. While differences in patient preference across racial and ethnic groups are documented, one major gap in our knowledge is what role physician practice characteristics have on disparities. While disparities could exist because the same physician is treating African-American and white patients differently, an alternative could be that people of different races with ADRD are seen largely by different physicians, with varying experience with either dementia or racial minorities. Furthermore, physicians seeing minority dementia patients may be in completely different physician “networks,” meaning minorities see physicians who have differential connections to providers with specialized ability to diagnose and treat people with dementia.    The influence of physician professional connections on behavior can be studied by drawing on methods developed for the study of social networks. Social networks are structural representations of social interactions and personal or professional relationships. For physicians, social networks consist of colleagues with whom they share information, which can be measured by inferring connections when physicians share patients. The goal of this R03 is to develop preliminary data and methods to study the influence of social networks of physicians on disparities in end of life (EOL) care delivered to white and African-American Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. We propose to address these questions developing social networks of physicians who provide EOL care to dementia patients, stratified by race, and study how these networks are associated with the quality and racial disparities of that care. Thus, this R03 is designed to: (1) construct and summarize physician patient-sharing networks for dementia patients and describe the relationship between network characteristics of their predominant provider of care and end of life outcomes; and (2) elucidate the relationship between physician patient-sharing networks and the disparities by race in intensity and quality of care received at the end of life for dementia patients. With greater understanding of the relationship between disparities in quality of care and physician networks, this R03 will form the basis for future research at Dartmouth to inform new areas of health economic and services research, and potentially many other questions regarding physician influence of healthcare quality and use for people with Alzheimer’s disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older populations. As the baby-boomer generation ages, it is critical that we understand how to assure that all older adults receive high quality care by addressing racial disparities in care. This project will provide important information about whether changing the way physicians interact with each other could be a mechanism for reducing racial disparities in end of life care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.",The Role of Physician Networks on Racial Disparities in Intensity of Care for Dementia Patients,9297474,R03AG055809,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Behavior ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', "" Physician's Practice Patterns "", "" Physician's Role "", ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Probability ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' tube feeding ', ' gastric feeding ', ' feeding tube ', ' enteric feeding ', ' Enteral Feeding ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' end of life care ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Medicare claim ', ' patient population ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' dementia care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' ']",NIA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R03,2017,81000,0.06140104917363682
"Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this application, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a presidentially initiated effort to understand the genetics of AD in hopes of developing new targets for therapies.

"Community-based End-of-life Intervention for African American Dementia Caregivers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End-of-life (EOL) care plans made in advance for relatives with dementia save families anguish in times of medical crises, but less than 13% of African Americans (AAs) have such plans. Yet, they have high morbidity and mortality rates from dementia. A community-based study will examine the efficacy of an education activation (EduAct) intervention for AA family caregiver healthcare proxies (HCPs) to make EOL decisions on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mechanical ventilation (MV), and tube feeding (TF). In a pre/posttest, two condition, repeated measure, randomized design, controlled efficacy trial, HCPs with no EOL care plans will be assigned to either EduAct or attention control groups. We will deliver 9 waves of 4 weekly sessions, a 4-mo booster tailored to residual knowledge deficits. We will enroll 304 AA HCPs (n=152 per group) in 4 urban AA churches randomly assigned to EduAct (n = 2) or control (n = 2) sites, with 8-9 subjects recruited concurrently at each site. The EduAct condition will receive interactive discussions from a nurse facilitator on EOL care planning, dementia, CPR, MV, and TF treatments. The attention control condition receives interactive health-promotion from another nurse facilitator. The Theory of Reasoned Action and Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory frameworks guide both interventions to enhance knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, and behaviors. Questionnaires will be completed pre, immediately post, and 4 mo (booster) for efficacy; evaluations completed at 6 mo, 12 mo, 18 mo, and 24 mo post intervention in both groups to document EOL care when a life threatening medical crisis occurs related to CPR, MV or TF. Lay teachers (n = 8) will be trained to demonstrate feasibility for a community-based model to continue the EduAct program after completion of the study. Specific aims are to: Aim 1. Compare the effect of the EduAct and attention control interventions on HCPs': (a) knowledge (dementia, CPR, MV, TF); (b) self-efficacy about EOL care plans; (c) intentions to write an EOL care plan and (d) behavior (written EOL care plan). Controlling for pretest values and selected covariates, we hypothesize that at all time points the EduAct group will have more: (a) knowledge, (b) self-efficacy, (c) intentions and (d) behaviors (primary outcome) than the control group. Aim 2. Compare the HCPs' immediate posttest written care plan and the care provided within 2 years when any life- threatening medical crisis occurred related to CPR, MV, and TF (exploratory aim). We hypothesize that significantly more EduAct group dementia victims will receive CPR, MV, or TF treatments consistent with the immediate posttest written care plan than the control group. Aim 3. Determine the feasibility of training lay teachers to deliver the EduAct program. Feasibility is defined as retention of lay teachers, fidelity of program delivery, self-efficacy to deliver the program, and intention to deliver future programs. We expect to retain at least 50% of the lay teachers who will deliver it with high fidelity, and report high self-efficacy and intention to delver the program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We developed an education program on dementia, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, tube feeding and mechanical ventilation for family caregivers' of relatives with dementia. The program is designed for caregivers to make the best end of life treatment decisions prior to a medical emergency. We will test the program to determine if works in a church setting and determine if lay teachers can conduct the program after the study is completed.",Community-based End-of-life Intervention for African American Dementia Caregivers,9265720,R01AG043485,"['advanced directive ', ' Advance Directives ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' heart resuscitation ', ' Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation ', ' Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Phonation ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' tube feeding ', ' gastric feeding ', ' feeding tube ', ' enteric feeding ', ' Enteral Feeding ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Site ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' satisfaction ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' success ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Proxy ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Anguish ', ' Mental Suffering ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Medical emergency ', ' attentional control ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' treatment choice ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,334377,0.028380527326962716
"Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center ABSTRACT - OVERVIEW The overall goal of the proposed renewal of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (Rush ADCC) is to continue to support the performance of cutting edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of MCI, AD, and other common dementias, by providing researchers with a stimulating multi-disciplinary environment, and unique and highly valued clinical and post-mortem data, and ante- and post-mortem biologic specimens. The Rush ADCC has been in continuous operation since 1991. It has eight Cores carefully designed to support a variety of timely and important areas of research including studies: 1) of the transition from normal aging to MCI and to the earliest stages of dementia with substantial participation by racial and ethnic minorities, 2) linking risk factors to normal aging, incident MCI and incident AD, and to post-mortem indices of AD and mixed pathologies, 3) that incorporate contemporary high throughput biochemical and molecular data into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, and 4) that link neuroimaging and biofluid biomarkers to contemporary biochemical and molecular data, 5) that support drug discovery pipelines, and 6) that support studies of impaired motor function. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADCC as a whole. The Clinical Core will collect UDS and additional data on Blacks without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Religious Orders Study (ROS) Core will follow older members of Catholic religious communities who have agreed to annual evaluation and brain donation at death. The Latino Core will collect the same data as in ROS on older Latinos without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Neuropathology Core will process, store, evaluate and distribute biospecimens obtained by the Clinical, ROS, and Latino Cores. The Outreach and Recruitment Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities into the Clinical and Latino Cores, and other NIA funded initiatives. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to provide the infrastructure that allows all other Cores to be maximally successful and impactful, and will provide statistical support to users of ADCC resources especially junior investigators and trainees. The new Research and Education Component will provide a structured program of mentorship across the ADCC, Rush University of the Rush ADCC strategic partners.

"Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias:  The Role of Blood Pressure Throughout Adulthood PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health burden and disproportionately affect African Americans. The mechanisms underlying this disparity are not well-understood, but elevated blood pressure could be key. Compared with whites, African Americans have higher prevalence, earlier age of onset, and greater severity of hypertension. Thus, older African Americans tend to have greater cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure throughout adulthood than older whites. No prior research, however, has quantified the contribution of hypertension to racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. There are significant methodological challenges to addressing this important question, including (1) measurement of cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure from the age of onset of hypertension through late adulthood, (2) measurement of cognitive function in diverse populations, and (3) possible survival bias, which is likely to differentially affect African Americans. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify the extent to which elevated blood pressure from mid- through late- adulthood mediates racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This project uses an innovative approach to examine this important question with existing data from two diverse Northern California cohorts: the University of California, Davis Aging Diversity Cohort and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Multiphasic Health Checkup cohort, which links mid-adulthood physical examinations with long-term medical record information. Analyses will address the three major methodologic challenges outlined above by examining cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure as measured at multiple points in adulthood, developing a novel neuroimaging-based brain health index in a diverse population, and quantifying the potential magnitude of survival bias using comprehensive midlife data to account for differential survival. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) measuring and modeling cognitive function in diverse populations, (2) clinical assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, (3) assessing brain health with neuroimaging, and (4) the biology of vascular disease relevant to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career focused on identifying modifiable determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in diverse populations. The methodological challenges addressed in this project are common to many areas of research on disparities in aging and cumulative exposure to risk factors throughout the lifecourse for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health problem and disproportionally affect African American older adults. Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias have been identified as a national priority by the National Alzheimer’s Project Act.

"Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive reserve refers to the ability to buffer against brain pathology, including types commonly found post mortem in the brains of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). I hypothesize that reserve is a key reason why some older adults have normal cognitive function despite the presence of neuropathology. Recently, researchers have begun to empirically investigate reserve as the discrepancy between neuropathology and brain function, as measured with cognitive tests. Studies have found a relationship between a disadvantaged early life environment and later life clinical dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. However, it is not known if an advantaged early life is related to greater later life reserve or lower levels of neuropathology itself. As brain development is particularly accelerated through age 5 years, early life could be a sensitive period for cognitive reserve. I propose to use four unique datasets that contain information on early life social environment, later life cognitive tests, and autopsy-based neuropathology measures from geographically diverse study populations: the Adult Changes in Thought Study, the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, the Religious Orders Study, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. I test the hypotheses that an advantaged early life environment, independently of and synergistically with adult social advantage, is related to greater later life cognitive reserve, even in the presence of significant neuropathology. I will be able to test also whether early life environment is related to actual levels of cognition and neuropathology. My background in demography and epidemiology, including 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow and 5 years as a junior faculty member, prepares me to lead these projects, under the guidance of a team that reflects the leadership of the proposed studies, local experts in neuropathology and epidemiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, a local expert in the analysis of cognitive measures, and a leading expert in the integration of social and life course epidemiology. The proposed training and research experiences in this project will be integral in building a foundation in the analysis of cognitive outcomes and resilience to dementia, and enhancing the experience of my existing skills in life course and aging epidemiology that will allow me to lead future projects at the intersection of these fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project identifies whether an advantaged early social environment increases one's later life cognitive reserve, that is, the ability to buffer from pathology. I measure an advantaged early social environment primarily through early life family socioeconomic position and height and also test to what extent an advantaged adult social environment explains this relationship, versus the link from early life to later life cognitive reserve.","Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve",9352731,K01AG050723,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Asia ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Baltimore ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Buffers ', ' Clergy ', ' Cognition ', ' Demography ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Illinois ', ' Japanese American ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' Memory ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' nutritional care ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' Head circumference ', ' news ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Height ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social inequality ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' early life exposure ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' study population ', ' Life course epidemiology ', ' Lifecourse epidemiology ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2017,18409,0.11199385342020583
"Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Core Center Overall – Project Summary  This application proposes a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSOM) to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD. Our Center will provide innovative resources to examine the contributions of metabolic and vascular factors to early phase transitions from normal aging to MCI and then to AD and other dementias, through coordinated research spanning the translational spectrum. Wake Forest is uniquely equipped to rapidly develop a high-impact ADCC because it has: 1) a deep, interdisciplinary foundation in aging research; 2) specialized expertise in metabolic and vascular factors and their relationship to cognitive aging and dementia; 3) strong ties to an ethnically diverse community with high prevalence of dementia and metabolic/vascular disorders; and 4) exceptional institutional support. The rationale for our theme is based on research showing that metabolic and vascular disorders are highly prevalent, modifiable factors that contribute to the transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias. To promote innovative translational research focused on these factors, the ADCC will enroll an observational multi-ethnic cohort from an existing 15-year study of metabolic/vascular risk, and leverage their extensive data by adding key endpoints to characterize AD and other dementias. The Clinical Core will enroll a separate cohort enriched for metabolic/vascular risk, along with participants with AD. The ADCC will focus on African-American (AA) and other underserved groups who are twice as likely to develop AD, and have high rates of diabetes and vascular disease. Specialized resources will be available to ADCC investigators, including non-human primate (NHP) models for translational research. A repository of human and NHP biospecimens, genetic/epigenetic data, and extensive clinical data will be available to NACC, NCRAD, and other investigators. The ADCC will also serve as a resource for a broad spectrum of AD initiatives. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Establish a comprehensive integrated research infrastructure focused on phase transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias, and provide special resources to accelerate research on metabolic and vascular factors; 2) Optimize the participation of AA adults to better understand the causes underlying their increased risk of AD and dementia; 3) Expand relationships with the national ADCC network and key affiliates such as NACC and NCRAD; 4) Provide training in translational research to new investigators, and education regarding AD and dementia to professionals, patients and families, and the community. The prevalence of metabolic and vascular risk factors, their importance to AD expression, the strengths of the Wake Forest scientific community in these research areas, and our outstanding institutional commitment are indicators that NIH funding will be successfully leveraged to establish an ADCC that will make high-impact contributions to the field. Overall – Project Narrative  This application seeks to establish a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine that will provide a comprehensive infrastructure for translational, interdisciplinary research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD and related disorders. Our ADCC will focus on the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and then to AD and other dementias, and understanding the contribution of metabolic and vascular factors to these transitions.

"Life Course Determinants of Epigenetic Age Acceleration and Subsequent Dementia PROJECT ABSTRACT  This proposal seeks to understand the impact of interactions between socioeconomic status (SES), genotype, and health behaviors on disparities in epigenetic age acceleration and cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. Under the guidance of primary mentor Dr. Sharon Kardia, the training and research plan will build upon Dr. Schmitz's expertise in health economics and genetic epidemiology to prepare her for an independent career that integrates social science, genetics, and epigenetics into aging research. The PI will pursue a program of training in epigenetics at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health that will advance her knowledge and skills in (1) epigenomic biology, (2) bioinformatics and related general programming, and (3) preprocessing and analysis of DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray data.  The proposed research plan will capitalize on a large sample of epigenome-wide data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (N=4,000) to construct measures of DNAm age in whole blood and test for associations with known genetic, social, and behavioral mechanisms of aging and cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. DNAm age been shown to predict age with high accuracy, and studies have linked positive deviations between DNAm age and chronological age (i.e. epigenetic age acceleration (age)) with age-related diseases and mortality, suggesting that epigenetic processes may play a role in healthy aging. However, few studies have investigated pathways between age and SES, and to date no study has evaluated whether the relationship between age and SES is moderated by genetic influences or mediated by risky health behaviors. This work builds on Dr. Schmitz's prior HRS research that used whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) and objective measures of the social environment to examine the effect of gene-environment interactions on physical health and cognitive function at older ages.  During the K99 phase, Dr. Schmitz will construct measures of DNAm age in the HRS to test for associations between age and disadvantaged SES, risky health behaviors, and demographic characteristics using longitudinal moderation-mediation methods. During the R00 phase, Dr. Schmitz will incorporate PGSs into the analyses to assess whether genetic propensity for educational attainment or cognition moderates the relationship between SES, age, and subsequent declines in cognitive function and incidence of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Comparative analyses will be conducted in an African American oversample (Nൎ1,000). R00 research will employ instrumental variables (IV) and dynamic panel methods to draw stronger claims regarding causality. Following these analyses, replication of main findings will be pursued in multi-ethnic cohorts that have comparable genetic, epigenetic, and social data. Results from this research program may shed light on the specific social and biological mechanisms that underpin the SES-mortality gradient. PROJECT NARRATIVE Research that can evaluate the joint effect of social and biological forces on age-related disease is needed to more accurately inform future research and policy intervention that seeks to extend life expectancy and quality of life among older adults. This study capitalizes on a large pilot sample of epigenome-wide data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (N=4,000) to understand the impact of socioeconomic status (SES), genotype, and risky health behaviors on disparities in epigenetic age acceleration and subsequent cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease.

"In search of an ethno-culturally appropriate approach for the early identification of Cognitive Impairment in African Americans PROJECT/SUMMARY ABSTRACT Completion of the projects outlined will serve as the foundation for my career's focus on studying factors that are involved in both cognitive and functional disparity and identifying the optimal methodology to assess both in African Americans (AA). We propose to test, in a cohort of 330 study participants with prodromal Alzheimer Dementia (AD) (at least 40% AA) whether quickly administered tests of executive vs. global function will 1) better correlate with measures of day-to-day function; 2) more strongly correlate with progression to dementia; and 3) be mediated by vascular diseases, namely hypertension (HTN). 1. To identify the optimal cognitive marker that best predicts functional impairment in older AA. A1—Sub aim: To determine whether impairment in executive function is superior to memory recall in predicting functional impairment in older community-dwelling African Americans. Hypothesis 1: Compared to White participants, among older community-dwelling AA, measures of executive function will better predict functional outcomes than memory recall-based cognitive assessments alone. A2—Sub aim:To determine whether impairment in executive function is associated with future cognitive and functional decline in older community-dwelling AA and is to a greater extent than for Whites. Hypothesis 2: Compared to White participants, among older community-dwelling AA, measures of executive function will better predict future cognitive and functional decline than memory recall-based cognitive assessments alone. 2. To investigate the role of HTN, key vascular risk factor, in cognitive function disparity as measured NIHTB-CB & CLOX1 as well as global function measures (MoCA) among the aforementioned groups. Hypothesis 3: Greater prevalent HTN will partially explain the disparity between AA and Whites in global and executive function. The funding of the projects and activities outlined in this application will serve as critical “startup” resources that will 1) underwrite the development of a local research infrastructure for the Principal Investigator (PI); 2) provide fundamental research skill improvement; and 3) protect time for relevant projects and the writing of manuscripts to disseminate findings. This proposal builds on earlier work toward identifying a cognitive assessment method that is simultaneously and significantly correlated with function, having practical extension and use in primary care for the early identification of cognitive impairment in older community-dwelling African Americans. The data and experience obtained from completing the projects in this proposal will serve as preliminary data for a planned application to further investigate factors in racial disparity in cognitive and functional impairments. PROJECT NARRATIVE This scope of research will test assessments designed to measure cognition in order to identify the best cognitive marker correlated with day-to-day function in older African Americans. These assessments are brief in their duration and will serve to identify a rapid strategy for the early identification of cognitive impairment in African Americans in primary care clinical environments. Additionally, we will investigate whether hypertension, widely prevalent in African Americans, partially explains the disparity between African Americans and Whites in global and executive functional impairment and progression to dementia and/or Alzheimer dementia.",In search of an ethno-culturally appropriate approach for the early identification of Cognitive Impairment in African Americans,9369141,R03AG056448,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Grant ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Failure ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' memory recall ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' daily functioning ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' fundamental research ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' vascular contributions ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Physical Performance ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,117000,0.08331726225556013
"An Analysis of Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors: Accelerated Cognitive Aging and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Among Retired NFL & Former NCAA Football Players Project Summary/Abstract: Robert W. Turner II is a Research Scientist in the Center on Biobehavioral Health Disparities Research at Duke University. He has training in medical sociology, ethnographic methods, and health disparities research. His previous and current work has exposed him to theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches pertinent to health disparity and aging research among men. The current proposal is for a five year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that address gaps in his knowledge of biobehavioral factors underlying Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) dementia related mild traumatic brain injury mTBI and accelerated cognitive aging. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Tim Strauman, Keith Whitfield, and Toni Antonucci) he has developed a comprehensive training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to gain expertise on the interrelationships between multiple measures of psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with AD dementia related accelerated cognitive aging, and serve as bridge for him to establish an independent investigator career in conducting biobehavioral health disparities research in adult male populations. To accomplish this goal, he proposes four career development activities and three research aims that combine instruction with established scholars in survey research techniques; formal coursework; participation in ongoing seminars at Duke and the University of Michigan; one-to-one directed readings with mentors; and finally, conducting of a “proof of concept study” from start to finish. Data will be collected using a mixed-method design that consists of a survey, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. The three research aims will enable him to integrate and apply knowledge gain through the proposed training activities by creating a more robust portrait of psychosocial protective and risk factors that may impact the long- term consequences of mTBI among men than previously possible. The approach used in this project will address; a) male vulnerabilities in predicting the impact of psychosocial factors on accelerated cognitive aging and b) how understandings of masculinity develop across and within groups in relationship to pain, injury, and brain health. This project will continue to build on insights he has gained through his examination of data from the Study of Retired NFL Players. By completing these aims, he will test important hypotheses and make substantial evidence based contributions to describing the process of dementia related cognitive accelerated aging resulting from mTBI. This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, and may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer’s disease resulting from concussions. It will also inform an R-series grant proposal to study AD dementia related accelerated cognitive aging and brain imaging that Dr. Turner plans to submit in year 4 of the project. Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common, costly, and potentially preventable condition in the United States. Despite heightened awareness as a result of national public health campaigns and increased visibility in the media, many individuals continue to be at risk of life-long and sometime debilitating effects of brain injury. The goal of this project is to explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, which may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer’s disease dementia resulting from concussions.",An Analysis of Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors: Accelerated Cognitive Aging and Mild Traumatic

"Racial Differences in Arterial Stiffness and Cognitive Function. Summary It has been stated that “a person is only as old as his/her arteries” (Sir William Osler ~ 1898). With aging, large central arteries such as the aorta and carotid arteries lose their elasticity while small peripheral arteries lose their ability to dilate and constrict in response to perturbations. Vascular dysfunction may affect blood flow delivery to the brain, directly impacting cognitive performance. African Americans have premature vascular aging, which may contribute to premature cognitive aging. In our first aim, we will examine racial differences in novel measures of arterial stiffness, endothelial function, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function. In our second aim, we will explore dynamic changes in aforementioned parameters during a cognitive challenge. Results from this study may suggest a crucial vascular component to racial differences in cognitive performance. Early intervention to target specific aspects of premature vascular aging in AAs as identified in this study may lead to better preservation of cognitive function with advancing age and help abrogate racial disparities in hypertensive cerebrovascular damage and cognitive impairment in later life. NARRATIVE Reduced artery elasticity, as naturally occurs with aging, has a negative effect on blood flow to the brain.

"BIOMARKERS AND DRIVING PERFORMANCE IN PRECLINICAL ALZHEIMER DISEASE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS AND CAUCASIANS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The goal of this pilot study is to examine whether aged African Americans and Caucasians differ in driving behaviors, and if so, whether these differences are linked to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) biomarkers, as well as vascular risk factors. Our research indicates that driving decline among older adults, an important functional outcome, is predicted by preclinical AD. However, little is known about driving behavior specifically in African American older adults. Closing this knowledge gap soon is critical, since African Americans are at twice the risk of symptomatic AD compared to Caucasians.  This research is significant because 36 million licensed drivers are aged 65 years or older, and the number of older adults in the United States is expected to double by 2050, when 1 in 4 drivers will be 65 years or older. Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury and death in older adults. Research on older African American drivers, to date, has only looked at driving cessation, and has not examined AD and cognition. The ability to identify who will be at most risk of driving decline and to predict when decline will occur would inform early driving safety intervention trials for older adults.  Our Specific Aims will test whether AD biomarker values interact with race and vascular risk factors (VRF) in predicting driving behavior over a one-year period: (1) We will determine, among cognitively normal older adults (N=60) whether there are racial differences in driving performance and behavior while adjusting for VRF, over a one-year period. (2) We will test whether factors known to be associated with AD predict driving performance and behavior by examining the three-factor interaction between race, AD biomarkers and VRF.  To test these Specific Aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in AD, neuroimaging biomarkers, CSF biomarkers, driving generally, naturalistic driving specifically, cognitive and brain aging, gerontology and longitudinal biostatistical methods. We will capitalize on our parent R01 by following a subset (N=30 African American, 30 Caucasian) of cognitively normal participants with and without preclinical AD. Each participant will take part in an annual, on-road driving evaluation to measure driving performance, as well as have their driving behavior captured daily, using a naturalistic method that collects data on date, time, speed, longitude and latitude each time a participant drives their vehicle.  We will test whether AD biomarker values and vascular risk factors interact with race in predicting driving performance and behavior. If the interaction between AD biomarkers and race is significant, this would stress the importance of obtaining biomarker measurements in research. These data may be valuable when seeking to explain the higher rate of AD development among African Americans, and in conducting clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury and death in older adults and by 2050, 1 in 4 drivers will be age 65 or older. Because African Americans are at twice the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to Caucasians, the goal of this pilot study is to examine whether driving behaviors differ by race cohort, and if so, whether these differences are linked to AD biomarkers. The ability to identify who will be at most risk of driving decline and to predict when decline will occur will inform early driving safety intervention trials for older adults with and without dementia symptoms.",BIOMARKERS AND DRIVING PERFORMANCE IN PRECLINICAL ALZHEIMER DISEASE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS AND CAUCASIANS,9455431,R03AG055482,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' ApoE ', ' Apo-E ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Cognition ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' vascular factor ', ' Measures ', ' range of motion ', ' Joint Range of Motion ', ' Articular Range of Motion ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' eye hand coordination ', ' hand/eye coordination ', ' hand and eye coordination ', ' eye/hand coordination ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' driving behavior ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' amyloid imaging ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' TREM2 gene ', ' Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 ', ' TREM2 ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,76250,0.04019561808972356
"Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center ABSTRACT The Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (Rush ADCC; P30AG10161) supports cutting edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other common conditions of aging, by providing researchers with a stimulating environment, highly valued clinical and post-mortem data, and ante- and post-mortem biologic specimens. The Rush ADCC supports a variety of timely and important areas of research including risk factors for the transition from normal aging to MCI to AD, the neurobiology of normal aging and MCI, and studies that incorporate contemporary omics technologies and neuroimaging to identify novel therapeutic targets. These research areas are supported through the careful design and integration of seven highly successful Cores: an Administrative Core; Clinical Core; Data Management and Statistics Core; Neuropathology Core; Outreach, Recruitment and Education Core; Religious Orders Study Core, and Latino Core, as well as the Research Education Component. The Rush ADCC and its ancillary studies including the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Minority Aging Research Study are building a vibrant neuroimaging portfolio of studies, some of which include participants of the Clinical and Religious Orders Study Cores for in-vivo imaging, and in collaboration with the Neuropathology Core for ex-vivo imaging. We are now generating autopsies on persons without dementia who have undergone in-vivo imaging. These are mostly non-Latino whites. Now that we have a relatively large number of African Americans and Latinos in the Clinical and Latino Cores, with a growing number of autopsies, we are in a position to expand this work in the minority communities. The overall goal of the proposed Neuroimaging Core is to generate a resource of neuroimaging data from the Rush ADCC African Americans and Latinos, and affiliated studies, and provide neuroimaging expertise to facilitate high quality, cutting edge, externally-funded research focusing on the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias. The proposed Neuroimaging Core will markedly extend the ability of the Rush ADCC to interrogate neuroimaging as part of its clinical-imaging-multi-level omics-pathology pipeline supporting studies of the transition from normal aging to MCI to the earliest stages of dementia, and studies of ante- and post-mortem biospecimens, and extend this work into the African American and Latino communities which are vastly under- represented. NARRATIVE The development of robust biomarkers is a major priority in AD research. The proposed Neuroimaging Core, in collaboration with the Rush ADCC ancillary studies, will generate a truly unique resource of ante-mortem imaging from African American and Latino persons with ante-mortem biofluids who come to brain autopsy without dementia. This resource will enable linking brain omics, to biofluid omics to brain pathology, neuroimaging, and cognitive and motor function in minorities to complement a similar resource of non-Latino whites that we are currently generating; we will make this resource available to the wide aging and AD research community.",Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center,9416596,P30AG010161,"['Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pathology ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Lewy Bodies ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' protein TDP-43 ', ' TDP-43 ', ' TAR DNA-binding protein 43 ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Proteomics ', ' neuropathology ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' minority health ', ' epigenomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' normal aging ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mixed dementia ', ' mixed pathology dementia ', ' in vivo imaging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease Core Center "", ' education research ', ' Common Core ', ' hippocampal sclerosis ', ' racial minority ', ' clinical imaging ', ' minority communities ', ' ex vivo imaging ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P30,2017,414373,0.08901433299469964
"The longitudinal effects of hypertension on cognitive aging in underrepresented minority adults with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY  Hypertension (HTN) affects approximately 33% of all adults living in the United States, particularly African Americans, who comprise over 42% of those with HTN [1-2]. In aging, HTN is associated with decreased cognitive functioning, and increased risk for clinically meaningful cognitive impairments and incident age-related neurodegenerative disorders [3-4]. HTN may confer risk for cognitive impairment via alterations in cerebral autoregulation (CA) caused by structural and functional changes to the cardiac and cerebral vasculature induced by HTN [5]. The impact of HTN on cognitive functioning in diverse, aging persons living with HIV (PLWH), however, is largely unknown, especially whether HTN differentially affects cognitive outcomes in HIV+ African Americans. Work in the cognitive aging literature suggests that HTN has a greater impact on cognitive functioning among African Americans than Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites [6]. One possible explanation for these differences may be due to disparities in HTN control that disproportionately affect African Americans [7-8].  As a result, we hypothesize that with aging, HTN as well as poor HTN control will exacerbate cognitive impairment in PLWH and that this effect will be greatest among African Americans. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal relationship between HTN and cognitive functioning in a diverse cohort of aging PLWH to examine the effects of HTN and HTN control on risk for cognitive impairments. These data will also be used to examine for racial disparities in the rates of cognitive impairment in this cohort. Finally given our limited understanding of the biological effects of HTN on brain functioning and cognition, the third aim of this study is to evaluate the longitudinal relationship between pulse pressure (PP), a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness, and cognition to indirectly explore the biological consequences of hypertension on the brain and CA [9]. Investigations regarding the potential impact of HTN, HTN control and PP on the brain and cognitive functioning are relevant given the increasing prevalence of HTN in aging PLWH, especially among HIV+ African Americans who currently comprise 50% of all HIV cases in the U.S. and experience greater hypertension burden [10]. Therefore, this project is both highly novel and significant as it will be the first to examine the longitudinal relationships between HTN, HTN control, PP and cognition in an exceptionally well- characterized and diverse sample with extensive longitudinal outcomes. Improved understanding of the role of HTN and HTN control on cognitive functioning in diverse, aging PLWH is critical to elucidate sources of health disparities frequently affecting underrepresented minority populations (URM). Thus, the results of this project also have important implications for public health, as this study will provide empirical evidence to inform and develop targeted intervention strategies that may mitigate cognitive dysfunction in URM. Project Narrative Hypertension and HIV disproportionately affect underrepresented minority populations, including African Americans, and these conditions may potentiate age-related cognitive decline through their effects on the central nervous system. This study will examine the relationship between hypertension and cognitive functioning in a diverse cohort of aging persons living with HIV and will also seek to determine whether hypertension and/or poor hypertension control differentially affect cognitive outcomes in HIV+ African Americans compared with Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites. Improved understanding of the role of hypertension in cognitive decline among underrepresented minority adults aging with HIV is critical to develop targeted intervention strategies that mitigate cognitive dysfunction. ",The longitudinal effects of hypertension on cognitive aging in underrepresented minority adults with HIV,9411178,F31MD011582,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old

"Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): India, the second-most populous country in the world, will soon experience rapid aging of its population. By 2050, India's older population (> 60 years old) is projected to reach 320 million (about the current size of the entire US population), representing an increase from 8 to 20 percent of its total population. The growing number of older people will drive a large increase in the prevalence of dementia in India, far exceeding the capacity of the private care system that currently predominates for the elderly. The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), a survey of 50,000 Indians representative of the older population across the nation and within its states and union territories, provides a unique opportunity to examine this and related issues. LASI is the most ambitious nationally representative study of the physical, mental, economic, and social well-being of the country's older population. Harmonized with other Health and Retirement Study (HRS) surveys, it offers an evidence base that can be used to compare the effects of social policies aimed at supporting older persons in India with policies used in other countries around the world. The objective of the proposed research is to supplement the current LASI in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in India. Previous efforts to identify dementia in developing nations have typically relied on non- representative samples in geographically restricted regions. In this application, we aim to develop a protocol for the assessment of dementia and MCI to be used within community settings in the ongoing, nationally representative LASI. To do so, we will first conduct in-depth cognitive testing for a sub-sample of LASI respondents at regional geriatric hospitals in India. Specifically, we will administer two leading dementia assessment protocols - the HRS Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) and the 10/66 Dementia Protocol - to approximately 2,000 respondents at least 60 years of age and stratified by their Wave 1 cognition test results, as well as their proximity to collaborating regional geriatic hospitals where the assessments will occur. Based on prognostic evaluation of the protocols, we will develop a short (15-minute) dementia assessment module and administer it in Wave 2 to persons with a high probability of having dementia and MCI as well as to the 2,000 persons participating in the earlier assessment. Using these data, we will estimate prevalence rates of dementia and MCI in India for the population and sub-populations. We will provide to the research community data generated from the in-depth cognitive testing at regional geriatric hospitals and from the administration of the short dementia assessment module during Wave 2, both linked to the on-going LASI main survey. Our harmonized protocol for dementia and MCI assessment will enable researchers to make comparisons with prior findings in India using the 10/66 protocol as well as to conduct cross-country studies with the United States, England, China, and other countries that implement the HRS HCAP protocol. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide a means for estimating the prevalence of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment for India that can be adapted to other harmonized surveys of aging in developing countries. The longitudinal nature of the project will provide insight on deterioration of cognitive abilities among the aged over time. The generated data will help researchers and policymakers determine the costs and burdens associated with providing care for older persons with diminished cognitive abilities.",Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI),9561746,R01AG051125,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Castes ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration / HMO ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospitals ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Persons ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Social Policies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Spottings ', ' Sister ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Venous ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' mathematical ability ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' social situation ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Physical Performance ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,150000,0.09824972097763647
"A Longitudinal Network Study of Alzheimer's and Dementia Care in Relation to Disparities in Access and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/dementia) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people in the U.S. and 11% of older adults. As with other chronic conditions, racial/ethnic and socio-economic disparities exist in the prevalence and burden of illness. However, less is known about how disparities in access to care influence the care trajectories – i.e. the scope, frequency and sequence of services used across health care settings – of those with AD/dementia. This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study will address this gap by using network analysis to examine care trajectories and outcomes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of community-dwelling individuals with AD/dementia and unspecified cognitive impairment (CI) who may be at risk for a delayed AD/dementia diagnosis. The cohort will consist of home health care patients served by the Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), a large, non-profit home care provider. Data will include clinical assessments for roughly 89,000 patients admitted to home care during 2010-2012 linked with 4 years of Medicare and Medicaid claims data and geographic data on neighborhood services. The specific aims are to:  (1) Describe the population at VNSNY within two diagnostic categories (AD/dementia and unspecified CI) in relation to adverse outcomes (e.g. pressure ulcers, falls, infection, dehydration, preventable hospitalization, and nursing home admission);  (2) Map, quantify and compare patterns in the care trajectories of individuals and groups that experience variable and/or disparate outcomes; and  (3) Identify strategies for implementing care trajectories with potential to reduce disparities in access and/or outcomes for AD/dementia and unspecified CI.  Applying a systems science framework, the study will use innovative network analytics to capture complex patterns in care trajectories that may contribute to adverse outcomes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of individuals with these two conditions. The long-term goal of this research is to identify and, in subsequent studies, test potential home- and community-based interventions that may improve access to services and outcomes for individuals who may be underserved or at heightened risk for unmet healthcare needs. This research will produce new knowledge to aid efforts to mitigate health disparities in this vulnerable and growing population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and dementia affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Little is known about how race, ethnicity or access to care affect the health outcomes of these people.

"Improving the measurement of everyday functional outcomes in diverse populations of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders Project Summary The aging population in the United States is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before. Health disparities have been well documented across diverse older adult populations, including evidence to suggest that there may be increased rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders among some groups. Researched aimed at understanding, preventing and ameliorating health disparities in AD is a major public health priority. However, to study and address these health disparities requires psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate assessment tools to sensitively measure early clinical signs associated with AD and to provide good outcome measures to track disease progression and response to treatment. The measurement properties of such assessment tools must be conceptually and psychometrically equivalent across diverse populations. With previous NIA funding (Farias, AG 0215111, AG 031252) we developed a novel questionnaire-based assessment tool (the Everyday Cognition scales (ECog) to measure very early limitations in everyday functions. Our work has shown that subtle changes in everyday functions, as measured by the ECog, can be used to identify older adults at increased risk for developing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, our most recent work has shown that the current version of the ECog is less sensitive to predicting disease progression in ethnic/racial minority subgroups (Latinos and African Americans) than it is in non-Latino Caucasians. Such findings provide clear rationale for the need to adapt and further refine this instrument to improve its utility as an early indicator of disease and as an outcome measure among diverse populations. The proposed study will utilize a multi-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to evaluate and improve the measurement equivalence of the ECog among diverse older adult populations. The aims of this study are twofold. In Aim 1 we will utilize existing data from the University of California, Davis Alzheimer Disease Center's multiethnic longitudinal cohort to quantitatively evaluate which items of the ECog display evidence of poor measurement equivalence across three racial/ethnic groups (African Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Caucasians) using sophisticated analytic methods. Informed by results of Aim 1, Aim 2 will employ well-established cognitive interviewing methods to further evaluate and identify the reasons why particular ECog items are problematic for specific racial/ethnic groups. For example, some items may not be readily understood as intended and/or some items may not be appropriate the cultural context and lifestyle of some groups. These items will be modified accordingly and a second wave of cognitive interviews will further evaluate item revisions. Completion of this study will provide the critical formative work to improve our ability to measure early changes in everyday function with comparable accuracy and precision across diverse older adult populations. Project Narrative While the aging population in the U.S. is becoming increasingly racially/ethnically diverse, health disparities remain problematic, including evidence that rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are disproportionately high among some groups. Researched aimed at understanding, preventing and ameliorating these health disparities in AD is a major public health priority. However, this requires accurate and culturally sensitive assessment tools to measure early clinical signs of AD and to provide good outcome measures to track disease progression and response to treatment. The proposed study will utilize a multi-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to improve the measurement of early everyday functional abilities associated with AD across diverse older adult populations.",Improving the measurement of everyday functional outcomes in diverse populations of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders,9371281,R03AG056563,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' California ', ' Cognition ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sound ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Comprehension ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' instrument ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Familiarity ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Property ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' alzheimer disease detection ', ' AD detection ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' public health priorities ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2017,78500,0.056167583713963236
"The Experience of Alzheimer's Disease Family Caregivers in a Hispanic Community: Cultural congruence and disparities in utilization of support services Project Summary The purpose of the proposed research project is to: 1) Describe the expressed preferences of Hispanic caregivers in South Florida for services that would help them better care for older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD); and 2) Examine the cultural congruence of available supports with the expectations of Hispanic ADRD caregivers through the comparison of themes emerging from interviews with providers and caregivers. Older Hispanics are one of the fastest growing demographic groups in the country, representing an estimated 20% of all persons 65 and over by 2050. Hispanics appear to have higher rates of Alzheimer’s and other dementias when compared to White Americans and African Americans, particularly in older age groups. Nearly 70% of the older adult population in Miami-Dade County, Florida is Hispanic, and this population is growing, especially among the 80+ age group. As this population of older Hispanics with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) grows, so will their caregiving needs. Living longer and physically healthier with Alzheimer’s will increase the need for family caregivers and the home and community- based services that support them. Deleterious effects have been associated with caregiving, including emotional burden, economic and social impact, higher risk for depression, psychotropic medication use, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, increases of health care services utilization, and mortality. We know in general that Hispanics provide more intensive caregiving, more hours, and more assistance with Activities of Daily Living. However, they also appear to relate to the stresses of caregiving differently, and underutilize services, such as support groups. Local utilization data from the area agency on aging show an underutilization of training and support services as currently provided. Despite an ethnically congruent local workforce, there may still be values held by Hispanic caregivers that differ from those of the service providers. This difference could impact the way services are delivered and received and result in critical limitations to the services currently available. If we are expecting an increase of Hispanic older adults being cared for by family, then closer attention needs to be paid to the potential limitations of current services in order provide services that will appropriately support Hispanic caregivers. The proposed research seeks to shift current practice by providing in-depth understanding of the potential differences between Hispanic ADRD caregivers perception of need and service providers understanding of these needs through ethnographic research and narrative analysis of data collected through in-depth interviews and participant observation. This research will be carried out in collaboration with the local area agency on aging with the goal of informing direct services to caregivers. The ultimate goal is to design and evaluate culturally appropriate Hispanic caregiver support services in the future. Project Narrative Older Hispanics are of the fastest growing demographic groups in the country and have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Hispanic family caregivers provide more intensive care and are at risk of adverse health outcomes from the stressors of caregiving, but utilize fewer formal support services. This project will investigate potential causes of the underutilization of services by examining the expressed preferences of Hispanic caregivers and comparing it to the services being provided in collaboration with the local area agency on aging.",The Experience of Alzheimer's Disease Family Caregivers in a Hispanic Community: Cultural congruence and disparities in utilization of support services,9386998,R03AG054142,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Client ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Training Support ', ' County ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Intensive Care ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Custom ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' economic impact ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' community based service ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' Caregiver support ', ' Care giver support ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,74746,0.02297226387847717
"Are there ethnic differences in brain amyloid and tau in the seventh decade of life? Our goal is to examine whether ethnic and racial differences in brain amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, the major neuropathology components of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), explain reported ethnic disparities in dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT) in Northern Manhattan We will examine ethnic differences in brain Aβ and tau, ascertained in-vivo with positron emission tomography (PET), among Hispanics, Non-Hispanic Blacks (Blacks), and Non-Hispanic Whites (Whites) aged 60 to 69 years from Northern Manhattan. We will also explore whether ethnic differences in brain Aβ and tau explain ethnic differences in memory performance, the earliest clinical marker of AD; whether ethnicity modifies the relation of APOE-ε4 and brain Aβ; whether ethnic disparities in literacy and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) moderate the association of brain Aβ and tau with memory performance. Lastly, we will explore whether the higher risk of DAT attributable to hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes) among Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites is explained by higher brain Aβ and tau. The risk of DAT is higher in elderly Blacks and Hispanics in Northern Manhattan compared with Whites. It is unknown whether this disparity is due to differences in AD neuropathology, CVD, CVD risk factors, or social determinants of health (SDOH). There is a paucity of studies of AD biomarkers in Blacks and Hispanics to answer this question, particularly in late middle age. We propose to address these gaps in knowledge taking advantage of an ongoing funded study of Aβ and tau PET (1R01AG050440, 3R01AG050440-02S1;09/01/15-05/31/20) in 100 Hispanics between 60 and 69 years of age at the time of brain imaging, a critical period for accumulation of AD neuropathology. We propose to extend this funded project to 100 Blacks and Whites aged 60 to 69 years from the same community in order to compare brain Aβ, tau, CVD, and cognition among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites in this understudied age group. We will ascertain brain Aβ using 18F-Florbetaben PET, and tau using 18F- THK-5351 PET at 2 time points 24 months apart. We will also conduct brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for co-registration of PET and for ascertainment of CVD (white matter hyperintensities and infarcts). Our primary aim is to examine whether there are ethnic differences in the presence of whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites aged 60 to 69 years from the community of Northern Manhattan. We will also explore across and within ethnic groups the association of whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, with memory performance, and moderation of this association by CVD and literacy. Secondary aim 1 is to compare the association of APOE-ε4 with whole brain fibrillar Aβ and tau across ethnic groups cross sectionally and longitudinally. Secondary aim 2 is to explore if ethnic disparities in hyperglycemia explain ethnic differences in whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex and memory impairment. We address the following objectives stated in in PAR-15-349: “Neuroimaging, neuropathology and the biology of AD”, “Analyses of pathways that create and sustain AD disparities”, and “Effect of Educational Attainment on Dementia Risk”. Our project is in line with the goals of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) by providing information that may explain the high burden of AD manifestations among Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites, and will addresses the paucity of AD biomarker data in the paucity of AD biomarker data in the seventh decade of life and in ethnic minorities.",Are there ethnic differences in brain

"Culture-Gene Relationship:  A Novel Model of Aging Cognitive Health Abstract  To reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), scientists and policy makers have called for new models of the disease. The proposed project tests a novel model of how culture and genes may interact to influence AD and cognitive health. This project will provide the first investigation of whether a modifiable, culture-based environmental factor, negative age beliefs, exacerbates the effect of the genetic-risk-factor apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4) on adverse cognitive outcomes, including risk for AD, and whether positive age beliefs increase the likelihood that APOE ε2 leads to beneficial cognitive outcomes, including reduced AD risk. The proposed project builds on our findings with older individuals that (a) negative age beliefs can lead to greater stress, worse cognitive outcomes, and a greater accumulation of AD biomarkers; and (b) positive age beliefs can protect against these outcomes. This project also builds on the finding that APOE ε4 and ε2 account for less than half of aging-cognition variance; age beliefs may help to explain the remaining variance. Our proposed project with older persons will examine four specific aims for the first time: Aim 1. To examine whether the APOE genotype moderates age beliefs' impact on cognitive outcomes. We predict: (a) APOE ε4 carriers will show a greater detrimental impact of negative age beliefs on cognitive outcomes, compared to non-APOE ε4 carriers; and (b) APOE ε2 carriers will show a greater beneficial impact of positive age beliefs on cognitive outcomes, compared to non-APOE ε2 carriers. Aim 2. To examine whether our age belief-APOE genotype model helps to explain disparities by race and sex on cognitive outcomes. Considering that members of marginalized groups may be more sensitive to age stereotypes, we predict: (a) African Americans will show a stronger additive influence of APOE ε4 and negative age beliefs on detrimental cognitive outcomes, as well as a stronger additive influence of APOE ε2 and positive age beliefs on beneficial cognitive outcome, compared to Whites; and (b) women, compared to men, will show the same pattern as older African Americans described in Aim 2a. Aim 3. To examine whether psychosocial factors, related to age beliefs, influence Aim 1 patterns. We predict: (a) those higher in vulnerability factors (e.g., perceived discrimination) will show a stronger additive influence of APOE ε4 and negative age beliefs on detrimental cognitive outcomes, as well as a weaker additive influence of APOE ε2 and positive age beliefs on beneficial cognitive outcomes; and (b) those higher in resiliency factors (e.g., feeling useful to others) will show the reverse pattern. Aim 4. To examine whether psychological and behavioral mechanisms link the age belief-genotype predictor to cognitive outcomes. We predict: stress and physical activity will act as mediators of this association.  This proposed project will draw on three longitudinal datasets with common key variables. This study meets the NIA priority to identify factors that could help explain disparities in AD risk by race and sex. Narrative  The proposed project presents and tests a new model of how culture and genes may interact to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive health. Since the cultural factor, age beliefs, can be modified, this project could lead to developing interventions that reduce the risk of AD.",Culture-Gene Relationship:  A Novel Model of Aging Cognitive Health,9311065,U01AG032284,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Apolipoproteins ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' Cognition ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Woman ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' APOE\xa0e4 ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' Measures ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,418750,0.11699699950311143
"Resilience Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease The overall aim of this longitudinal study is to identify new, modifiable mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) among a multi-ethnic cohort of approximately 2,000 older adults. The incidence of AD is higher for African Americans and Hispanics, compared to non-Hispanic Whites, even after controlling for the “usual suspects” in disparities research: traditional socioeconomic indicators and vascular health. Persistent and unexplained disparities suggest two possibilities that have not been well-examined: (1) known AD risk factors exhibit differential impact across race/ethnicity and/or (2) yet unmeasured factors increase AD risk for minorities. Our research team has identified multiple factors that have stronger cognitive impact among older African Americans or Hispanics, including depressive symptoms and MRI markers of brain pathology. These variables, along with poor vascular health and lower education/income, may be less impactful among Whites because membership in a majority group is associated with social-environmental resources that promote resilience. In the current proposal, resilience is conceptualized as better-than-expected outcomes given level of AD risk factors or brain pathology. This study will examine how resources that differ across race/ethnicity in our cohort (e.g., perceived social status, quality of education, and the perception that life outcomes are controllable) promote resilience at multiple points in the AD pathogenic pathway using repeat MRI and cognitive assessments across three time points. Because racial/ethnic minorities face unique stressors (e.g., acculturative stress, racial discrimination), we will also test whether these experiences influence the progression of MRI markers of brain pathology, cognitive decline, and incident AD. Our overarching hypothesis is that AD disparities persist because racial/ethnic minorities have depleted resources to adapt to known AD risk factors and brain pathology and/or unique, yet unmeasured AD risk factors. Specific aims are to (1) identify risk factors relevant to minority populations and examine whether they predict advancing brain pathology, cognitive decline, and incident AD among African Americans or Hispanics, (2) determine which resources explain racial/ethnic differences in the impact of known AD risk factors on advancing brain pathology (i.e., brain resilience), and (3) determine which resources explain racial/ethnic differences in the impact of advancing brain pathology on cognitive decline and incident AD (i.e., cognitive resilience). The prevalence of AD and the societal burden associated with AD treatment and care are on the rise because the U.S. population is aging. The proportion of U.S. elders who are African American or Hispanic is also increasing. These groups are at higher risk for AD than similarly aged non-Hispanic Whites, even after traditional socioeconomic indicators and cardiovascular health are taken into account. It is therefore critical to identify other, modifiable factors that reduce AD risk and eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in AD.",Resilience Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease,9217868,R01AG054520,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' social ', ' response ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' regional atrophy ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,1163439,0.1744195925757889
"Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Due to Ambulance Diversion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2007, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) characterized ambulance diversion (AD), the practice by which Emergency Departments (EDs) are temporarily closed, as ""antithetical to quality medical care"" and called for its ""elimination"". Nevertheless, A persists, with 45% of EDs and 70% of urban EDs reporting AD in the last published survey in 2003. AD has been associated with higher mortality, delayed treatment, and other adverse outcomes. Not examined hitherto, AD has the potential to exacerbate disparities by race/ethnicity and income. AD may also increase healthcare costs. However, the current literature on the impact of AD is based on data from convenience sampling and is limited by a dearth of experimental evidence. On 1/1/2009, Massachusetts became the first, and to date only, state to ban AD. Treating the state-imposed ban as a natural experiment, we propose to estimate the causal impact of AD on access, outcomes, and cost, focusing on the potentially differential effects by race/ethnicity and income.  To better understand ambulance use and AD within the milieu of overall patient care, we will develop a national longitudinal database of ambulance use based on Medicare administrative data. Using longitudinal patient records, this data will be better suited to examine the determinants of ambulance use, outcomes, and the impact of AD across diverse patients.  We will focus on older adults with a chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary condition. We will identify a national cohort of a stratified random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 or older (N=1,000,000), with an oversample from Massachusetts, and obtain data on all healthcare utilization, including ambulance and ED visits, from 2006-2012. Given the primacy of residential location in examining ambulance and ED use, this sample will be stratified by race/ethnicity and residence zip code to enable comparison of diverse patients from the same area. For the subset of Boston residents (Boston cohort) we will merge data from the Boston Emergency Medical Services (EMS) from 2006-2012 for EMS-specific outcome measures. Our specific aims are to evaluate: (1) incidence of ambulance use and reliance, (2) differences by race/ethnicity and income in ambulance transport outcomes, and (3) impact of Massachusetts AD ban on outcomes of ambulance transport and other ED patients not transported by ambulance.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has highlighted the ""limited"" research and knowledge base of EMS practices. Using novel data with national scope, this study will make significant contributions to this evidence base and inform public policy on AD regarding not only its impact on clinical outcomes, but also, its impact on disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine (IOM) characterized ambulance diversion (AD), the practice by which Emergency Departments (EDs) are temporarily closed, as ""antithetical to quality medical care"" and called for its ""elimination"". Massachusetts is the only state to ban AD, effective 1/1/2009. Using a novel data of ambulance use developed from administrative data from Medicare and Boston Emergency Medical Services, this study will use quasi-experimental methods to estimate the causal impact of AD on ambulance travel, type of destination ED, patient mortality, length of stay, and costs.",Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Due to Ambulance Diversion,9205252,R01HL127212,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Ambulances ', ' Boston ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cost measurement ', ' Cost Measures ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Destinations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' beneficiary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Natural experiment ', ' safety net ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' longitudinal database ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Patient risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,484254,0.11391560631937965
"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Contextual Disadvantage and Alzheimer's Disease Abstract: Dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged—populations often exposed to neighborhood disadvantage, a condition associated with education, health behaviors, mortality and disease. Although studies have linked neighborhood to diseases such as diabetes and cancer, very little is known about the effect of neighborhood disadvantage on development of dementia. A better understanding of the interactions among social and biological processes is necessary to design effective interventions to ameliorate AD disparities. We have created and validated neighborhood-level quantifications of socioeconomic contextual disadvantage for the full US—over 34 million Zip+4 codes—employing the latest American Community Survey data. This metric--the Area Deprivation Index (ADI)--incorporates poverty, education, housing and employment indicators; predicts disparity-related health outcomes; and can be used to establish a `dose' and timing of exposure to lifetime neighborhood disadvantage. Our long-term objective is to examine the impact, mediators and moderators of exposure to socioeconomic contextual disadvantage on the development of AD-specific pathologic features, vascular burden and cognitive decline. Our short-term objective is to establish the necessary preliminary assessments, infrastructure and methods to enable us to further our long-term goal. In addition to capitalizing on the data available through the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), we will create detailed residential histories for each subject (N~1918). Furthermore, since post-mortem brain tissue allows for characterization of AD neuropathological burden, we will work with the US Census to validate a novel technique for the creation of lifetime residential histories for specimens housed within two ADRC–based brain banks (N~2745). Aim 1: Determine the impact of the cumulative dose and timing of neighborhood disadvantage exposure, by ADI, on cognitive function and cognitive change over time; and Aim 2: on AD-specific markers indexed by neuroimaging (amyloid and tau PET) and CSF (P-tau, Aβ42). Secondary outcomes include volumetric MRI and markers of neurovascular health. Exploratory Aims 1a, 2a: Using existing data, define the extent to which race/ethnicity, age, gender and APOE4 status modify, and income, education, comorbidity and health-behaviors mediate, these relationships. Aim 3: Validate a novel technique for the creation of lifetime residential histories for brains within two ADRC based brain banks (Wisconsin and University of California-San Diego) in partnership with the US Census. Exploratory Aim 3a: Using existing brain bank data, define the extent to which the cumulative dose and timing of neighborhood disadvantage exposure, by ADI, impacts neuropathologic diagnosis, features. Impact: The project will better understanding of the fundamental mechanistic linkages between neighborhood disadvantage and AD, providing a potential pathway to new therapeutics and directly responsive to NIA mission.

"Cognitive impairment in Mexican Americans: a population-based study Abstract Hispanic/Latinos will comprise more than 30% of the U.S. population by mid-century, and Mexican Americans account for the largest share of this growing segment of society. This proposal aims to use door-to-door surveillance in Nueces County, Texas, a non-immigrant, bi-ethnic community, to determine the prevalence and trajectory over time of cognitive impairment and dementia in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will elucidate the mechanisms that explain the hypothesized ethnic disparity in Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer-related dementias by evaluating the roles of vascular disease risk factors, educational attainment and socio-economic status among others. This research will also delve deeply into the differences in informal caregiving for Mexican American and non-Hispanic whites with cognitive impairment and dementia. Caregiver burden and mental and physical health of caregivers will be examined toward efforts to develop interventions that build resilience in caregivers. A novel ability of this population-based study is to examine community resources for both patients and caregivers, and how these provisions differ by ethnicity. Using a rigorous mixed methods approach we will identify the gap between available resources and needs for those with cognitive impairment and dementia. In this way we will be well positioned to propose ethnic-specific testable interventions that promote mental and physical health for those with cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as for those family members who provide the care. This research will therefore lead to improved well- being, autonomy and outcomes among those with cognitive impairment and dementia and their caregivers. The investigative team members have conducted research in this community for 20 years and are experts in Mexican American culture and health, cognitive impairment and dementia, epidemiologic methods, community needs assessment and health behavior research. As the Mexican American population continues its tremendous growth and aging it is vitally important to better understand the prevalence and outcomes of cognitive impairment and dementia in this population, and to rapidly develop interventions that address the burden of these common conditions in Mexican American adults, families, and communities. Project Narrative The Mexican American population in the U.S. is rapidly growing and aging. This project seeks to determine the prevalence and outcomes of cognitive impairment and dementia in Mexican Americans.

"Characterizing disparities in late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk through polygenic risk and epidemiologic factors in the Health and Retirement Survey PROJECT SUMMARY Late-onset Alzheimer's dementia (LOAD) is terminal and the most prevalent form of dementia (70% of cases). LOAD is a major public health burden in the US with current prevalence estimates of 4 to 5 million adults and economic costs exceeding $236 billion annually. Important disparities in LOAD prevalence occur with sex, race/ethnicity, education, and residence. The biological bases of these health disparities are incompletely characterized and their influences on LOAD are likely to be multifactorial. Thus, studies with sufficient sample sizes, concurrently assessing multiple characteristics, such as educational attainment, environment, social, behavioral, lifestyle, geographic, and genetics, will be uniquely positioned to effectively test factors or combinations of factors that create and sustain LOAD disparities. Our goal is to determine the joint genetic and environmental contributions to LOAD risk that underlie these health disparities. Using existing genomics data, well-characterized dementia phenotypes, and diverse risk factor data, we will analyze up to 16,000 aging participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), attempt clinical confirmation in participants of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) sub-cohort of the HRS, and test replication in other clinical and population-based samples. Our aims are to (1) determine the cumulative genetic risk of LOAD by testing the association between cognitive polygenic scores and risk of dementia phenotype in European and African ancestries; (2) determine the polygenic effect of LOAD risk covariates from behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial domains on dementia phenotypes in European and African ancestries; and (3) test for effect modification of the association between polygenic risk and dementia phenotype in European and African ancestries by health disparities factors (sex, education, urban/rural residence). This study will likely impact the field of Alzheimer's research and contribute to public health because it will a) establish the relevance of cumulative genetic risk on LOAD in susceptible populations where genetics may be a more relevant factor; b) elucidate important biological mechanisms through polygenic scores; c) determine the combined and individual gene-environment contribution to LOAD risk; d) generate unified polygenic scores and dementia phenotypes across major longitudinal cohorts involving diverse populations that can be used in future investigations of health outcomes and/or additional exposure domains; e) consider the effects of sex, educational attainment, ancestry, and urban/rural status in the same study where comparisons of relative contribution to risk can be made. We have the opportunity to simultaneously and significantly improve our understanding of the genetic and environmental etiologic contributions to health disparities in LOAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall purpose of this proposal is to establish the relevance of polygenic risk in susceptibility to dementia, particularly among groups at increased risk of disease, including women, minorities, rural inhabitants, and those with low educational attainment. Because an individual's susceptibility to dementia is likely a combination of genetics and environmental risk factors, we will jointly test the effects of cumulative genetic risk and dementia risk factors in our analysis. The proposal provides an opportunity to identify a genetic etiologic component in vulnerable groups that could lead to mechanistic understanding or targeted interventions to substantially benefit

"Nonlinear Models of Cognition Preceding AD and non-AD in a Biracial Population Sample This proposal aims to conduct secondary analyses of existing data to examine nonlinear cognitive decline in standardized global summary of cognition assessed using executive functioning, episodic memory, and overall global cognition and orientation within the context of a large population-based study of older adults: Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). More specifically, the four objectives of this proposal are: 1) Examine Nonlinear Cognitive Decline in Older Blacks and Whites Using Change Point Models in a Random Sample of 2,948 Participants with AD and non-AD Diagnosis; 2) investigate the Role of Demographic, Social, Lifestyle, Cardiovascular, and Genetic Risk Factors on Nonlinear Cognitive Decline in Older Blacks and Whites with AD and non-AD Diagnosis; 3) Identify the Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Cognitive Decline Using Latent Class Growth Curve Models Using a Population Sample of 7,757 Blacks and Whites with Multiple Cognitive Assessments; 4) Understand the Role of Demographic, Social, Lifestyle, Cardiovascular, and Genetic Risk Factors on Latent Class Memberships to Explain Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Cognitive Decline. Understanding the rate of cognitive decline in older blacks and whites has a topic of considerable interest. However, most research has focused on linear trajectories in whites with mixed findings among blacks. Nonlinear cognitive decline based on change points are nonexistent in blacks and the proposed work can increase our understanding of preclinical phase of AD and non-AD. Description: This proposal aims to conduct a secondary data analysis to study the nonlinear changes in cognitive function using change point models for decline preceding AD and non-AD and the covariate effects of five sets of risk factors, namely, demographic, social, lifestyle, cardiovascular, and genetic on nonlinear cognitive decline. The study also proposed the use of latent class growth curve models to examine the heterogeneity in population- level cognition and nonlinear cognitive decline in a population-based longitudinal study of older adults. This proposal is based on a longitudinal cohort of 7,757 older adults who were followed for about 19 years with data collection done every 3 years for cognitive assessments. The clinical diagnosis of AD and non-AD is available on 2,948 participants who were sampled using a stratified random sample.

"Remote Ambulatory Cognitive Assessment of African American and Caucasian Adults PROJECT SUMMARY Challenges exist in recruiting and retaining minorities in research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), thereby limiting the ability to elucidate mechanisms for health disparities in AD risk and to adequately measure treatment efficacy in underserved populations. African Americans represent an especially important group to target for research due to their two-fold risk of AD compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians. Advances in technology to evaluate cognitive functioning, particularly the use of mobile applications such as smartphones, offer the promise for overcoming barriers that may limit African American research participation including scheduling difficulties, associated study costs, and examinee/examiner cultural mismatches. Remotely administered neuropsychological measures can be performed at an individual’s convenience, and outcomes can be collected at multiple time points. In the proposed R03 study, we will leverage the resources and volunteers who have signed up for a new community initiative at our institution, the Emory Healthy Aging Study, involving remote engagement of individuals through smartphone technology. The Co-PIs have selected tasks from the cognitive neuroscience literature that are non-proprietary and have strong behavioral and neuroimaging correlates in APOE-4 carriers, amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD patients, and healthy aging groups. The proposed grant will pilot these measures when administered via smartphones to middle-aged and older African Americans and Caucasians, with the overall goal of determining whether group differences exist that could have diagnostic relevance in future studies. Sixty African American and 60 non-Hispanic Caucasian adults 45-75 years of age will complete the traditional versions and the smartphone adaptations of the cognitive measures in the clinic setting and will then complete the smartphone applications remotely at 3 and 6 months post-baseline assessment. Specific Aims are to 1) Establish reliability of the smartphone applications (both internal consistency and in comparison to the traditional version (inter-modality reliability)) 2) Establish test- retest reliability of the smartphone measures; and 3) Assess adherence rates of the remotely administered smartphone measures. A secondary Aim is to examine factors (i.e., quality of education, socioeconomic status, and vascular comorbidities) that we expect to be correlated with performance on cognitive measures administered via smartphones and that are underlying factors often associated with cognitive performance differences between African Americans and Caucasians. The long-term goal of a future study is to validate these mobile cognitive measures against neuroimaging, genetic, and CSF biomarkers of central amyloidosis. African Americans are especially important group to include in clinical research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to their increased risk for AD compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians. Advances in technology to evaluate cognitive functioning, particularly the use of mobile applications such as smartphones, offer the promise for overcoming barriers that may limit African American research participation including scheduling difficulties, associated study costs, and examinee/examiner cultural mismatches. The findings of high adherence rates and reliability of remote ambulatory cognitive assessment measures in African American adults, and at levels comparable to Caucasian adults, would demonstrate the feasibility of overcoming logistical barriers and could improve recruitment and retention efforts.",Remote Ambulatory Cognitive Assessment of African American and Caucasian Adults,9300324,R03AG055810,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' amyloid disease ', ' Amyloidosis ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Literature ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' APOE\xa0e4 ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Schedule ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Performance ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' response ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' volunteer ', ' healthy aging ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' longitudinal design ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive task ', ' amnestic mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,78000,0.13169347130511905
"Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): India, the second-most populous country in the world, will soon experience rapid aging of its population. By 2050, India's older population (> 60 years old) is projected to reach 320 million (about the current size of the entire US population), representing an increase from 8 to 20 percent of its total population. The growing number of older people will drive a large increase in the prevalence of dementia in India, far exceeding the capacity of the private care system that currently predominates for the elderly. The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), a survey of 50,000 Indians representative of the older population across the nation and within its states and union territories, provides a unique opportunity to examine this and related issues. LASI is the most ambitious nationally representative study of the physical, mental, economic, and social well-being of the country's older population. Harmonized with other Health and Retirement Study (HRS) surveys, it offers an evidence base that can be used to compare the effects of social policies aimed at supporting older persons in India with policies used in other countries around the world. The objective of the proposed research is to supplement the current LASI in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in India. Previous efforts to identify dementia in developing nations have typically relied on non- representative samples in geographically restricted regions. In this application, we aim to develop a protocol for the assessment of dementia and MCI to be used within community settings in the ongoing, nationally representative LASI. To do so, we will first conduct in-depth cognitive testing for a sub-sample of LASI respondents at regional geriatric hospitals in India. Specifically, we will administer two leading dementia assessment protocols - the HRS Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) and the 10/66 Dementia Protocol - to approximately 2,000 respondents at least 60 years of age and stratified by their Wave 1 cognition test results, as well as their proximity to collaborating regional geriatic hospitals where the assessments will occur. Based on prognostic evaluation of the protocols, we will develop a short (15-minute) dementia assessment module and administer it in Wave 2 to persons with a high probability of having dementia and MCI as well as to the 2,000 persons participating in the earlier assessment. Using these data, we will estimate prevalence rates of dementia and MCI in India for the population and sub-populations. We will provide to the research community data generated from the in-depth cognitive testing at regional geriatric hospitals and from the administration of the short dementia assessment module during Wave 2, both linked to the on-going LASI main survey. Our harmonized protocol for dementia and MCI assessment will enable researchers to make comparisons with prior findings in India using the 10/66 protocol as well as to conduct cross-country studies with the United States, England, China, and other countries that implement the HRS HCAP protocol. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide a means for estimating the prevalence of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment for India that can be adapted to other harmonized surveys of aging in developing countries. The longitudinal nature of the project will provide insight on deterioration of cognitive abilities among the aged over time. The generated data will help researchers and policymakers determine the costs and burdens associated with providing care for older persons with diminished cognitive abilities.",Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI),9301438,R01AG051125,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Castes ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration / HMO ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospitals ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Persons ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Social Policies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Spottings ', ' Sister ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Venous ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' mathematical ability ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' social situation ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Physical Performance ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,533329,0.09824972097763647
"Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) provides Georgia and the region with comprehensive clinical, research, and educational programs. This renewal application outlines our success in building an environment that encourages and supports innovative projects with a general theme of discovery and translation of new targets and mechanisms to enable early identification, early interventions, and ultimately prevention of AD. Given the well documented disparities in clinical research participation and burden of disease for AD in the African American community, the Emory ADRC focuses special effort to understand and address inter-individual differences in AD, ranging from ethno-racial factors to personal differences in genetic and protein variation. We benefit from generous institutional support from Emory, one of the nation's fastest growing research academic medical centers, the generous Atlanta community, and a highly collaborative team from more than 20 departments and centers. Five Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology, and Outreach Recruitment and Education), coordinate activities to effectively recruit, evaluate, and engage a diverse cohort of volunteers who actively participate in a wide variety of research studies that aim to better define the trajectory from normal cognitive aging to symptomatic stages of disease. Data from the Cores are captured and stored for distribution to local researchers and for national collaborations. Our biospecimen banks include well-characterized neuropathological case materials, blood and CSF, and DNA. These valuable resources are distributed widely for a variety of approved studies of genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and pathological investigations. The ADRC educational programs reach a broad audience of students, health care professionals, and the public. Three cutting edge research projects are closely integrated with ADRC Cores: Project 1, AD Biomarkers and Endothelial Dysfunction in Caucasians and African Americans, is a longitudinal biomarker study with full integration into the ADRC Clinical Core and OREC, leveraging a unique community based Registry for Remembrance to facilitate recruitment of African Americans; Project 2, A Proteogenomic Approach to Understanding AD GWAS Results, proposes to use state-of-the art targeted gene resequencing and mass spectrometer-based protein sequencing to advance understanding of genetic risk of AD by genetic loci by linking novel gene variants at 20+ recently identified loci directly with the encoded and expressed protein variants in AD brain in an allele specific manner; Project 3, Defining the Properties of Pathogenic Aβ strains in Alzheimer's Disease, takes an interdisciplinary approach to build on pioneering work showing AD brain extracts are transmissible in animal models, by investigating how structural differences in Aβ strains from asymptomatic vs. symptomatic stages of AD vary in their seeding and propagation in yeast and animal models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Emory ADRC has grown dramatically during the past funding cycles (years 6-10), and now seeks a 3rd renewal (years 11-15). The ADRC contributes to the NIH/NIA-funded network and plays a critical role in the coordinated response to the growing public health threat from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emory's active participation in the network fosters research to understand the causes, investigate novel targets and interventions that will lead to more effective treatments and prevention, and improve the treatment of affected individuals with AD and related conditions, and the well being of their family caregivers.",Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center,9280749,P50AG025688,"['University Medical

"MyCog - Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings Cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia are significant public health burdens that can have profound social and emotional effects on older adults. Early detection of CI is imperative in order to identify potentially treatable underlying causal conditions, and in cases where cure is not possible, to provide supportive services to minimize the effects of CI. While primary care and other clinical settings are ideal places for identifying CI, it frequently goes undetected. Available screening tools may be unsuitable for implementation in such settings because of their length, cost, or need for specialized equipment or highly trained administrators. Our project, MyCog: Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings, will create a brief, readily available, standard set of CI screening measures applicable for use in diverse settings and with diverse populations. Comprised of two cognitive measures drawn from the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function® and the Everyday Cognition self- and informant-report measures and implemented as a downloadable app, MyCog will be validated in a large sample of older adults (ages 65+) enrolled in “LitCog III: Health Literacy and Cognitive Function among Older Adults”. Field testing MyCog within LitCog III will allow validation in multiple clinical workflows and in African-Americans, a health disparities population. Our proposed project will 1) Create a standalone MyCog App using existing NIHTB cognition tests and Everyday Cognition self-/proxy report measures that will report screening results as either “No CI detected”, or `CI detected” and provide follow-up recommendations and guidelines for each outcome; 2) Validate MyCog (UH3 Phase) in primary care settings and determine its sensitivity in detecting early indicators of CI using an existing cohort (LitCog III) of well-characterized, ethnically and racially diverse adults ages 65- 85; 3) Evaluate the success of MyCog clinical implementation in primary care settings; 4) Optimize MyCog for use in clinical settings by adjusting scoring algorithms to maximize efficiency and incorporating features that facilitate clinical integration; and 5) if selected to do so, coordinate consortium-wide activities. Cognitive impairment (CI) is increasing in the US as our elderly population increases, and therefore early detection of CI is critical for ensuring its appropriate management. This project will create a brief CI screening battery (the MyCog App), available in English and Spanish versions, that can be easily implemented in everyday clinical settings with diverse populations. MyCog, comprised of existing measures of cognitive function, will be validated in a large, general population sample of elderly individuals, including many African Americans and people with low socioeconomic status who are at increased risk of experiencing health disparities.",MyCog - Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings,9482649,UG3NS105562,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Americas ', ' Cognition ', ' Equipment ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' processing speed ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes ', ' LOINC ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' rapid detection ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' implantation ', ' usability ', ' primary care setting ', ' standard measure ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,UG3,2017,551643,0.02189676239387307
"Impact of estrogen  loss and replacement on GluN2B containing NMDARs, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory in females using a novel transgenic rat model of Alzheimer’s Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease targets two-thirds more women than men, likely a result of hormone loss during menopause. Clinical and preclinical data support beneficial roles of 17estradiol (E2) and its replacement post-menopause on neuronal function, amyloid and tau pathology, and cognition. However, it is unknown how E2 improves or maintains synaptic processes underlying cognitive function throughout early asymptomatic and symptomatic disease progression. Abnormal activation of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs and loss of synaptic GluN2Bcontaining NMDAR as a consequence of increased soluble toxic Aand increased activity of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP are believed to mediate synaptic deficits in presymptomatic AD. The increased activation of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs appears to mediate spine loss and LTP deficits in hippocampus in transgenic AD mice. Therefore, minimizing aberrant extrasynaptic GluN2B-NMDAR activation early in the disease is critical to delaying its onset and slowing its progression. Importantly, proestrous-like levels of plasma E2 not only increases spine density and LTP, it selectively increases synaptic current mediated by GluN2Bcontaining NMDARs that are critical for the E2-enhanced learning and memory. These beneficial effects of E2 could directly oppose the negative effects of increased soluble Ao, but whether E2 can stimulate these synaptic changes in the context of accumulating AD pathology is an open question. We will use a novel transgenic rat model of AD, TgF334-AD, and brain slice electrophysiology combined with learning and memory behavior to test the overarching hypothesis that that proestrous-like E2 replacement can heighten synaptic function in OVX Tg females by increasing synaptic and decreasing extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs along with their associated signaling molecules, which will be linked to increased synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease afflicts two-thirds more women than men, likely a result of ovarian hormone loss during menopause. We will use a novel transgenic Alzheimer's disease rat model to thoroughly investigate the protective mechanisms triggered by proestrous levels of E2 on hippocampal synaptic function and learning and memory during asymptomatic disease stages.","Impact of estrogen  loss and replacement on GluN2B containing NMDARs, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory in females using a novel transgenic rat

"Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral Vascular Disease in American Indians DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AIs) experience a disproportionately high incidence of cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) relative to non-Indians with twice the stroke rate of the general US population. Neuroimaging techniques have shown CBVD-related brain abnormalities to be associated with disruption of neurpsychological performance. Therapy for post-stroke cognitive impairment has been challenging. Cognitive therapy involves intense, focused, regular mental activity, intellectual stimulation, and behaviora exercises that assist individuals to regain or maintain cognitive function. and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia after brain insult. Interactive Metronome (IM) therapy is a promising form of behavioral therapy for CBVD-related cognitive and motor function. This technology uses operant conditioning of an individual's responses through simple, repetitive motor tasks (e.g., clapping hands, tapping feet) in time with a set beat. Through visual and auditory feedback, IM addresses processing speed, attention, and immediate and delayed memory, all of which can be affected by CBVD. IM therapy can improve quality of life, physical mobility, gait, and CBVD- related cognitive deficits. The ongoing Strong Heart Stroke Study (SHSS) (1R01HL093086-01A1; Dedra Buchwald, PI) is investigating CBVD-related brain abnormalities through MRI scans on 1000 AIs from the original SHS cohort. The proposed study will capitalize on this current SHSS to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to ascertain the effects of a culturally tailored IM intervention on cognition, depression, and quality of life. We ill target SHSS participants with subclinical CVBD defined by impaired cognitive processing speed. We will select a sample of 180 American Indians age 68 to 80 years participating in the SHSS. The specific Aims for this study of older American Indians are as follows: 1) Determine if the culturally-adapted IM intervention can improve cognitive functioning among older AIs with CBVD; and 2) Estimate the impact of IM on health-related quality of life. This study will yield important insights into the relationships among cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and brain abnormalities that can inform treatment efforts as one way to reducing AI CBVD disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will further our knowledge of the relationships among of cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and CBVD-related brain abnormalities providing valuable direction for more effective screening, treatment, and prevention of CBVD-related cognitive impairment. Thus, this study has significant health disparities implications for American Indians who exhibit the highest rates of stroke and related risk factors.",Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Ethnically Diverse Cohorts for the ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) PROJECT SUMMARY  The Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national sequencing initiative focused on identifying genetic risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in an effort to identify new pathways for prevention and new targets for drug development. The projects’ discovery phase included whole exome sequencing (WES) of 10,914 unrelated cases (N=5,778) and controls (N=5,136) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,019 familial samples. A majority of these samples are non-Hispanic white (NHW) in origin, making the addition of ethnically diverse samples to the study critical to identification of both shared and novel genetic risk factors for AD between populations. This ethnic diversity was emphasized in the ‘ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) Phase’ planning stage with a directive that additional existing cohorts with unrelated AD cases that ‘encompass the richest possible ethnic diversity’ be given the highest priority for inclusion.  To fulfill the goals of this RFA and this FUS Phase Mandate, this proposal identifies seven existing elderly cohorts of African-American (AA) and pan-HI ancestry with a total of 10,430 samples (N=2,322 AA AD cases and 1,843 AA controls and 2,928 Hispanic AD cases and 2,875 Hispanic controls) for WGS and processing in collaboration with existing NIH-funded AD infrastructure. Combining these cohorts with existing African America (AA) and Hispanic (HI) sequencing from the Washington Heights-Hamilton Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the ADSP will provide large ethnically diverse datasets for both validation of ADSP discovery phase findings and discovery of novel risk and/or protective variants for AD. Importantly, these data will allow for admixture mapping, a powerful method of gene mapping for diseases that show differential risk by ancestry, by comparing allele frequency differences between populations. They will also become an invaluable resource for the AD research community at-large, and will help to address the health disparities that contribute to AA and HI populations having higher rates of AD than NHW. Thus, we will address these important issues by creating a large dataset of AA and pan-HI AD cases and controls for study.  Specifically we propose to: 1) increase the ethnic diversity of the ADSP by assembling samples from existing cohorts with AA and HI AD cases and controls; 2) collaborate with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) in assemblage, storage, and distribution of DNA on these cohorts; 3) generating genome-wide SNP array data and WGS for all collected samples; and 4) collaborate with the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) in processing, quality controls, storage and distribution of the final datasets. Our overall goal is to enhance the discovery of AD risk factors by facilitating research on AD in ethnically diverse datasets.

"The Experience of Alzheimer's Disease Family Caregivers in a Hispanic Community: Cultural congruence and disparities in utilization of support services Project Summary The purpose of the proposed research project is to: 1) Describe the expressed preferences of Hispanic caregivers in South Florida for services that would help them better care for older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD); and 2) Examine the cultural congruence of available supports with the expectations of Hispanic ADRD caregivers through the comparison of themes emerging from interviews with providers and caregivers. Older Hispanics are one of the fastest growing demographic groups in the country, representing an estimated 20% of all persons 65 and over by 2050. Hispanics appear to have higher rates of Alzheimer’s and other dementias when compared to White Americans and African Americans, particularly in older age groups. Nearly 70% of the older adult population in Miami-Dade County, Florida is Hispanic, and this population is growing, especially among the 80+ age group. As this population of older Hispanics with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) grows, so will their caregiving needs. Living longer and physically healthier with Alzheimer’s will increase the need for family caregivers and the home and community- based services that support them. Deleterious effects have been associated with caregiving, including emotional burden, economic and social impact, higher risk for depression, psychotropic medication use, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, increases of health care services utilization, and mortality. We know in general that Hispanics provide more intensive caregiving, more hours, and more assistance with Activities of Daily Living. However, they also appear to relate to the stresses of caregiving differently, and underutilize services, such as support groups. Local utilization data from the area agency on aging show an underutilization of training and support services as currently provided. Despite an ethnically congruent local workforce, there may still be values held by Hispanic caregivers that differ from those of the service providers. This difference could impact the way services are delivered and received and result in critical limitations to the services currently available. If we are expecting an increase of Hispanic older adults being cared for by family, then closer attention needs to be paid to the potential limitations of current services in order provide services that will appropriately support Hispanic caregivers. The proposed research seeks to shift current practice by providing in-depth understanding of the potential differences between Hispanic ADRD caregivers perception of need and service providers understanding of these needs through ethnographic research and narrative analysis of data collected through in-depth interviews and participant observation. This research will be carried out in collaboration with the local area agency on aging with the goal of informing direct services to caregivers. The ultimate goal is to design and evaluate culturally appropriate Hispanic caregiver support services in the future. Project Narrative Older Hispanics are of the fastest growing demographic groups in the country and have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Hispanic family caregivers provide more intensive care and are at risk of adverse health outcomes from the stressors of caregiving, but utilize fewer formal support services. This project will investigate potential causes of the underutilization of services by examining the expressed preferences of Hispanic caregivers and comparing it to the services being provided in collaboration with the local area agency on aging.",The Experience of Alzheimer's Disease Family Caregivers in a Hispanic Community: Cultural congruence and disparities in utilization of support services,9686224,R03AG054142,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Client ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Training Support ', ' County ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Intensive Care ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Custom ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' economic impact ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' care giving burden ', ' community based service ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' primary care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' Care giver support ', ' Caregiver support ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIA,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH,R03,2018,74904,0.02297226387847717
"Role of midlife cardiovascular disease on Alzheimer’s Pathology and cerebrovascular reactivity in the young-old. 15. Project Summary/Abstract: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to the presence of cardiovascular disease (CaVD), understanding the relationship between amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and CaVD is critically important. The overarching goal of this study is to further the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology, including Aβ and tau pathology and neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular reactivity and midlife CaVD. To achieve these goals, we will utilize a group non-demented participants from an existing cohort from the ongoing community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with a cohort of 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years at study entry and has collected a wealth of longitudinal vascular measures. We hypothesize that subclinical CaVD identified in midlife is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease pathology expressed as amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration. These changes in brain structure would be associated with alterations in cognition both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We further hypothesize that the change in cognition will result from a failure of vascular compensatory responses, marked by increases in regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity. 8. Project Narractive: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CaVD) are two of the most common disorders of aging, understanding the relationship between the pathologies of these two disorders is critically important.

"Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes Abstract African Americans (AAs) have a greater risk for poor cognitive aging compared to White Americans, whether measured as clinical dementia or as lower cognitive function in late life. Previous research indicates that while older AAs demonstrate poorer cognitive function, they do not have faster declines after age 65 compared to their White counterparts, indicating that perhaps differences emerge earlier than 65. However, few studies have assessed cognition in both middle and late life in AA populations. Further, we have a limited understanding of the processes that drive risk for poor cognitive outcomes or the moderators that may act as resilience factors in these populations. AAs living in disadvantaged neighborhoods experience a disproportionate burden of socioeconomic stressors throughout life at both the individual (e.g., economic disadvantage) and the neighborhood (e.g., lack of access to services, disorder) level. AAs also experience substantial disparities in diet and weight compared to Whites. Both of these factors are known influences on cognitive function and are themselves influenced by neighborhood and individual stress, potentially explaining these associations. In response to NOT-AG-18-008, this administrative supplement proposes to add measures of cognitive function and clinically adjudicated Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease to our ongoing NCI-funded study (CA149105) that is following a cohort of mid- to late- life African Americans residing in two low-income neighborhoods. The proposed supplement will build on the parent study's rich existing data, which includes repeated measures of individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic conditions from 2011 through 2018. While the focus of the currently funded (parent) study is on neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, dietary intake and BMI, we will use the supplement to address new aims examining the role of diet, the neighborhood environment and BMI in explaining the association of individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics to cognitive function and clinically-adjudicated cognitive outcomes. This additional data collection will provide us with preliminary data to support a planned R01 submission focused on individual and neighborhood-level socioeconomic conditions and cognitive decline/ Alzheimer's disease risk in this high-risk cohort. Aims include: 1) Characterize cognitive function and the prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in a sample of disadvantaged AAs aged 50 years and older; 2) Evaluate the relationship between individual and neighborhood socio-economic conditions and cognitive function and clinical cognitive outcomes; 3) Examine the direct, potentially reciprocal relationship between diet (e.g., omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, alcohol, and B vitamins), BMI and cognitive outcomes. Further, explore diet and BMI as mechanisms that explain any relationships between socio-economic conditions and cognitive outcomes and impairment.

"Natural Experiment of Neighborhood Revitalization and Cardiometabolic Health Project Abstract African Americans (AAs) have a greater risk for poor cognitive aging compared to White Americans, whether measured as clinical dementia or as lower cognitive function in late life. Previous research indicates that while older AAs demonstrate poorer cognitive function, they do not have faster declines after age 65 compared to their White counterparts, indicating that perhaps differences emerge earlier in life. However, few studies have assessed cognition in both middle and late life in AA populations. Further, the cumulative, life course variability within high-risk populations has not been well studied, limiting our understanding of the mediators that drive risk for poor cognitive outcomes as well as the moderators that may act as resilience factors in these populations. AAs, particularly those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods, experience a disproportionate burden of stressors throughout life at both the individual (e.g., unfair treatment) and the neighborhood level (e.g., disorder and crime). This difference in cumulative stress burden is likely a key driver of disparities in cognitive outcomes. In response to PA-18-591, we propose to add measures of cognitive function and clinically adjudicated Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease to our ongoing NHLBI-funded study (HL131531) which is following a cohort of low-income, mid- to late- life African American residents. Building on the parent study's rich existing data, which includes repeated measures of blood pressure (2016 and 2018) and stored blood samples (2016 and 2018), we will use the supplement to address new aims concerning the role of individual and neighborhood-level stressors in contributing to cognitive function and clinically- adjudicated cognitive outcomes, and the role of poor vascular health and physiologic aging (telomere length assessed via stored blood) in explaining these associations. This new data collection and new aims will allow us to collect preliminary data to support a planned R01 submission focused on cumulative stress burden and cognitive decline/ Alzheimer's disease risk, in this high-risk cohort.

"Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research ABSTRACT Despite experiencing Alzheimer’s-related health problems at a disproportionate rate, African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Insufficient enrollment of African Americans in this line of research is a nationally-recognized problem. This is highly concerning not only because of the need for unbiased, representative samples in basic science and clinical research, but also because involving persons from underrepresented minority groups is crucial to advancing our understanding of, and ultimately combating, health disparities. In response to PAR-15- 349 “Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease”, we propose to develop and evaluate a novel strategy that uses a storytelling campaign to enhance recruitment of African American adults into research at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center. In Specific Aim 1, we will build on our promising pilot work to refine and evaluate community members’ acceptance of a storytelling strategy for communicating Alzheimer’s-related research participation experiences of African Americans in mid and late life. The storytelling strategy will highlight African Americans’ research participation narratives, as derived from a series of ethnographic interviews and told using short videos. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the effect of this storytelling strategy on recruitment of African Americans into ADRD research. Videos developed in Aim 1 will be incorporated into all existing ADRC recruitment efforts, ranging from community events to social media strategies. The primary outcome for Aim 2 will be the proportion of African Americans recruited to the ADRC Clinical Core over an 18 month period, with the preceding 18 month period serving as the comparator. Specific Aim 3 will use path analysis modeling to explore the mechanisms by which a storytelling strategy increases enrollment of African Americans into ADRD research in general, and into a specific study designed to address health disparities. Realizing the goals of this study will increase racial and ethnic diversity in ADRD research at a leading NIA-funded ADRC and ultimately, help to reduce cognitive health disparities amongst African Americans. Findings from this study will directly inform best practices for increasing diversity within the national AD Centers network, with significant implications for a range of underrepresented populations. Furthermore, these findings will also have applications in other disease contexts in which scientific progress is constrained by insufficient recruitment of persons from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups. This project will examine how a strategy called storytelling may help to increase research participation among persons of African American ethnicity. The project will focus on recruitment to research studies related to Alzheimer’s disease, which is particularly important because 1) Alzheimer’s poses a substantial threat to public health, 2) African Americans experience Alzheimer’s-related health problems at disproportionately high rates compared to non-Hispanic whites, and 3) , African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Findings from this study will inform best practices for recruitment throughout the NIA-funded national network of Alzheimer Disease Research Centers, and resources developed through this project will be shared accordingly.",Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research,9535812,R01AG054518,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' health economics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' combat ', ' primary outcome ', ' social media ', ' Care giver support ', ' Caregiver support ', ' dementia care ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racial minority ', ' relative cost ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,603756,0.10309370202789803
"Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center ABSTRACT - OVERVIEW The overall goal of the proposed renewal of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (Rush ADCC) is to continue to support the performance of cutting edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of MCI, AD, and other common dementias, by providing researchers with a stimulating multi-disciplinary environment, and unique and highly valued clinical and post-mortem data, and ante- and post-mortem biologic specimens. The Rush ADCC has been in continuous operation since 1991. It has eight Cores carefully designed to support a variety of timely and important areas of research including studies: 1) of the transition from normal aging to MCI and to the earliest stages of dementia with substantial participation by racial and ethnic minorities, 2) linking risk factors to normal aging, incident MCI and incident AD, and to post-mortem indices of AD and mixed pathologies, 3) that incorporate contemporary high throughput biochemical and molecular data into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, and 4) that link neuroimaging and biofluid biomarkers to contemporary biochemical and molecular data, 5) that support drug discovery pipelines, and 6) that support studies of impaired motor function. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADCC as a whole. The Clinical Core will collect UDS and additional data on Blacks without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Religious Orders Study (ROS) Core will follow older members of Catholic religious communities who have agreed to annual evaluation and brain donation at death. The Latino Core will collect the same data as in ROS on older Latinos without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Neuropathology Core will process, store, evaluate and distribute biospecimens obtained by the Clinical, ROS, and Latino Cores. The Outreach and Recruitment Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities into the Clinical and Latino Cores, and other NIA funded initiatives. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to provide the infrastructure that allows all other Cores to be maximally successful and impactful, and will provide statistical support to users of ADCC resources especially junior investigators and trainees. The new Research and Education Component will provide a structured program of mentorship across the ADCC, Rush University of the Rush ADCC strategic partners. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERVIEW The prevention of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia is a major public health priority. The proposed continuation of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center will generate resources that are being used to support a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of MCI and dementia, and to identify novel therapeutic targets for its treatment and prevention.",Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center,9576291,P30AG010161,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clergy ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Proteomics ', ' neuropathology ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' epigenomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' normal aging ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' motor impairment ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' relational database ', ' operation ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease Core Center "", ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' education research ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P30,2018,164144,0.14897909184260155
"MyCog - Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings Cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia are significant public health burdens that can have profound social and emotional effects on older adults. Early detection of CI is imperative in order to identify potentially treatable underlying causal conditions, and in cases where cure is not possible, to provide supportive services to minimize the effects of CI. While primary care and other clinical settings are ideal places for identifying CI, it frequently goes undetected. Available screening tools may be unsuitable for implementation in such settings because of their length, cost, or need for specialized equipment or highly trained administrators. Our project, MyCog: Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings, will create a brief, readily available, standard set of CI screening measures applicable for use in diverse settings and with diverse populations. Comprised of two cognitive measures drawn from the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function® and the Everyday Cognition self- and informant-report measures and implemented as a downloadable app, MyCog will be validated in a large sample of older adults (ages 65+) enrolled in “LitCog III: Health Literacy and Cognitive Function among Older Adults”. Field testing MyCog within LitCog III will allow validation in multiple clinical workflows and in African-Americans, a health disparities population. Our proposed project will 1) Create a standalone MyCog App using existing NIHTB cognition tests and Everyday Cognition self-/proxy report measures that will report screening results as either “No CI detected”, or `CI detected” and provide follow-up recommendations and guidelines for each outcome; 2) Validate MyCog (UH3 Phase) in primary care settings and determine its sensitivity in detecting early indicators of CI using an existing cohort (LitCog III) of well-characterized, ethnically and racially diverse adults ages 65- 85; 3) Evaluate the success of MyCog clinical implementation in primary care settings; 4) Optimize MyCog for use in clinical settings by adjusting scoring algorithms to maximize efficiency and incorporating features that facilitate clinical integration; and 5) if selected to do so, coordinate consortium-wide activities. Cognitive impairment (CI) is increasing in the US as our elderly population increases, and therefore early detection of CI is critical for ensuring its appropriate management. This project will create a brief CI screening battery (the MyCog App), available in English and Spanish versions, that can be easily implemented in everyday clinical settings with diverse populations. MyCog, comprised of existing measures of cognitive function, will be validated in a large, general population sample of elderly individuals, including many African Americans and people with low socioeconomic status who are at increased risk of experiencing health disparities.",MyCog - Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings,9570803,UH3NS105562,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Americas ', ' Cognition ', ' Equipment ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' processing speed ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes ', ' LOINC ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' rapid detection ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' implantation ', ' usability ', ' primary care setting ', ' standard measure ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' clinical implementation ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,UH3,2018,1337789,0.02189676239387307
"Rio Grande Valley Alzheimer's Resource Center for Minority Aging Research: Partnerships for Progress Summary OVERALL Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is an aging-associated disorder that disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who exhibit AD rates 1.5 times higher and average onset 7 years earlier than do older whites. Predicted growth of the US Hispanic population, particularly faster in Texas, portends further exacerbation of the disproportion- ate health and economic burdens of elevated AD in Hispanics. There is a shortage of researchers focused on AD and related disorders (ADRD) in Hispanics, particularly from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. To overcome these barriers, the proposed AD Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (AD-RCMAR) at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), one of the nation's largest Hispanic-serving institutions, will combine evidence-based mentoring and support mechanisms to develop and promote a first-rate regional and national cadre of researchers, particularly from under-represented groups, to analyze the complex mecha- nisms and interacting factors that contribute to Hispanics' disparate vulnerabilities to AD. The Center will sup- port identification of pathways and developmental time points at which changes in social circumstances and behavior can exert the largest favorable impacts on prevention and progression of AD among Hispanics. The UTRGV AD-RCMAR will exploit its unique resources to develop infrastructure and data collections that will at- tract and support researchers from multiple disciplines and at different scientific career stages, and allow them to conduct research aimed at reducing the impacts of AD on Hispanics. The socio-demographic profile of UTRGV reflects that of its local community, positioning the Center uniquely to advance studies of disparities in health and health care and contribute innovative solutions to improve minorities' health. We will achieve the Center's goals via 4 specific aims: 1) to identify, engage, mentor, and provide high-quality training and individu- alized career development support to outstanding faculty, especially from underrepresented groups; 2) to sup- port innovative, high-impact multidisciplinary pilot projects; 3) to provide expertise and resources for culturally- sensitive measurement and analysis of cognitive risk factors in older Hispanics, including behavioral, neuro- psychological, neuroimaging, and cardiovascular and genetic traits; and 4) to create the necessary expertise and resources to establish longitudinal research cohorts of older Hispanics and their families. We will achieve these aims through the creation of 4 Cores (Administrative; Research Education; Analysis; and Community Liaison/Recruitment) to support AD research. The Center will build upon the experience of investigators at the UTRGV Institute of Neuroscience and collaborators at the South Texas Diabetes & Obesity Institute, and Washington University's AD Research Center. Project Narrative Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is an aging-associated disorder that disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who represent the faster growing segment of the elderly population in the US and particularly in Texas. Build- ing on longstanding strengths in social, behavioral and biomedical research at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and facilitated by partnership with the Washington´s University Alzheimer´s Disease Research Center, the UTRGV AD-RCMAR will lead and coordinate an effort in South Texas to enhance the diversity of the research workforce of minority aging and develop infrastructure and data collections that will attract and support researchers from multiple disciplines and at different scientific career stages, and allow them to conduct research aimed at reducing

"Native Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR) OVERALL ABSTRACT American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) are increasingly concerned about Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), as these conditions will have a major impact on their communities. Although AI/ANs and NHPIs are culturally diverse and dispersed throughout the US, they share a high prevalence of ADRD risk factors. In addition, life expectancies for AI/ANs and NHPIs have improved over the last 50 years by as much as 30 years, resulting in a tripling of their population share of people aged 65 and older. The confluence of perceived need, high risk, and limited data motivates us to propose a Native Alzheimer’s Disease-related Resource Center in Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR). Our research team offers unique scientific resources and opportunities as well as an extensive network of academic and community partnerships. Based at Washington State University (WSU), with collaborators at Stanford University and the University of Colorado, we will create an innovative program to understand, intervene on, and mitigate the ADRD-related health disparities experienced by AI/ANs and NHPIs. The Center’s theme will emphasize AI/AN and NHPI health disparities and aging from the individual to the population level. Our Research Education Component will fund meritorious Pilot Studies led by early-career investigators known as RCMAR Scientists. RCMAR Scientists will receive mentorship and training in methods, measurements, and study designs that meet high scientific standards and are culturally appropriate. They also will be mentored in the development of successful funding proposals so that they can pursue independent careers in ADRD research. Notably, 13 professionals who are either AI/AN or NHPI will participate as Co-Investigators, Consultants, or RCMAR Scientists. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Build infrastructure, assemble resources, and provide scientific expertise to enhance the diversity of the aging research workforce by mentoring promising junior and mid-level underrepresented minority scientists for sustained careers in ADRD research, focusing on AI/AN and NHPI populations; 2) Recruit RCMAR Scientists, especially those of AI/AN, NHPI, and other URM backgrounds, to conduct Pilot Studies in the social, behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical sciences on ADRD, and use these Pilot Studies as a vehicle for delivering mentorship and career guidance; and 3)Promote advances in ADRD research and increase the number of independent underrepresented minority researchers, with an emphasis on AI/AN and NHPI health faculty, who can address the health and well-being of AI/AN and NHPI elders, health disparities, and aging from the individual to the societal level. NAD-RCMAR will also capitalize on the national network of Satellite Centers created by Drs. Buchwald and Manson and led by AI/AN researchers. These Satellite Centers will ensure that our efforts are national in scope, especially our recruitment of RCMAR Scientists, our identification of datasets relevant to ADRD in AI/ANs and NHPIs, and our dissemination of results. This work will help address NIA’s research priorities for ADRD among underrepresented minorities, as articulated in the 2012 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Our Center responds to NIA’s interest in diversifying the scientific workforce. OVERALL NARRATIVE We will launch an effort to describe, understand, intervene on, and mitigate the Alzheimer’s disease health disparities experienced by American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. We will achieve this goal by funding social and behavioral Pilot Studies that advance the field, emphasizing the recruitment and mentorship of Native junior and mid-level researchers. These trainees will receive training on methods and analyses so that their work meets high scientific standards, while being culturally appropriate. This work will advance Alzheimer’s disease research and increase the number of independent investigators focused on Alzheimer’s disease disparities experienced by our target populations.",Native Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR),9531968,P30AG059295,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pathology ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Smoking ', ' Target Populations ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vocational Guidance ', ' executive coaching ', ' career counselor ', ' Vocational Counseling ', ' Occupational Guidance ', ' Career Guidance ', ' Career Counseling ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Chippewa ', ' Ojibwa ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' professor ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' Department chair ', ' distinguished professor ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' minority scientist ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,P30,2018,580586,0.01734239255460873
"Carolina Center on Alzheimer's Disease and Minority Research (CCADMR) OVERALL SECTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Due to its tremendous human and financial burden, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have risen to the forefront of the United States (U.S.) public health agenda. Older African Americans are at an increased likelihood of having ADRD. South Carolina has the highest age-adjusted death rate from ADRD in the U.S. A better understanding of the role that sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental determinants have on ADRD outcomes among African-American communities in the Southeast is critically and immediately needed. The overall goal of the proposed Carolina Center on Alzheimer’s Disease and Minority Research (CCADMR) is to increase the diversity of the research workforce focused on population health and determinants of ADRD disparities through sustained infrastructure that will support underrepresented and minority (URM) faculty focused on the health and well-being of minority elders. The Specific Aims of the proposed AD-RCMAR are to: (1) increase the capacity of URM scholars to advance the science on the sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence ADRD outcomes in order to reduce ADRD-related disparities, with a focus on African Americans, and (2) advance the science of ADRD research focused on population health and determinants of ADRD disparities through research education in population-based, secondary data analysis, interdisciplinary co-mentoring teams, well-established strategies for recruitment of AD-RCMAR Scientists, and education on Health Disparities and Minority Aging Research. The proposed CCADMR is a state-wide collaboration, providing mentorship and education on determinants of ADRD disparities using population-based datasets for URM faculty throughout South Carolina, at the three major research institutions, including University of South Carolina (UofSC), Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), and Clemson University (CU), and three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including Allen University, Claflin University, and South Carolina State University. Interdisciplinary and partner-engaged research, with which the principal investigators (PIs) and research team have expertise, will be an effective strategy for addressing ADRD-related disparities. The proposed Center leverages the multiple PIs’ extensive leadership in providing critical training in aging and ADRD for URM Scientists and their research expertise in cognitive aging, minority health, and ADRD disparities. The PIs and Core Leads are well-established and collaborative scholars with substantial mentoring experience and content knowledge that will contribute to the success of the proposed CCADMR.

"Race, Childhood Social Disadvantage, and the Adult Brain: HANDLS BRAINCHILD. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed career development plan is to launch the candidate's independent research career investigating the mechanisms by which racial disparities in exposure to early life social disadvantage (ELSD) promote accelerated subclinical and clinical brain pathology in African Americans (AA) across the life course. There are pronounced AA-White disparities in brain health endpoints including stroke, dementia, and cognitive decline. Recent data suggest that earlier disparities in brain health are also noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Exposure to greater ELSD - characterized by harsher residential and neighborhood environments and lower parental socioeconomic status (SES) - may chart a course towards an accelerated onset of and more severe brain pathology observed in AAs as characterized by multiple MRI-assessed indicators of subclinical brain pathology including lower gray matter (GM) volumes, greater white matter lesion volumes and lesser WM integrity. This application was originally submitted in response to the NIA K01 PAR- 09-136, ""Promoting Careers in Aging and Health Disparities Research"" that sought to delineate social factors that precipitate late life health disparities among minorities and elders from disadvantaged backgrounds. Due to discontinuation of that PAR, the current application is a resubmission to the NIA K01 PA-11-190, Mentored Research Scientist Development Award. This K01 will allow the candidate to extend her prior training on the relation of psychosocial factors to coronary heart disease risk among adolescent and early to midlife AAs by providing training in (1) the life course perspective and accelerated theories of aging, particularly as applied to racial disparities in social disadvantage and health, and (2) the brain and related vasculature, and MRI- indicators of brain pathology including subclinical cerebrovascular disease. The proposed project will be a substudy to the ongoing HANDLS SCAN project - itself an ancillary study to the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study, a 20-year epidemiological investigation conducted by the NIA Intramural Research Program that assesses health disparities in > 3,500 AA and White adults (ages 30-64 at baseline) living in Baltimore, MD. In up to 400 HANDLS participants, HANDLS SCAN examines the relations of race and adult SES to MRI-indicators of brain pathology that may underlie risk for stroke, dementia, and cognitive and functional decline. In the proposed study, 300 HANDLS SCAN participants will complete measures of ELSD to determine: (1) whether ELSD is related to MRI-indicators of brain pathology predictive of future stroke, cognitive, and functional decline, and whether these associations are more pronounced in AAs than in White adults, and (2) explore potential psychosocial, behavioral, and biomedical mediators of these associations. The interdisciplinary training outlined in this application will allow the candidate o carve out a unique and unmatched research program that is desperately warranted by the pronounced prevalence of cerebrovascular and other brain disease in AAs. The interrelations among life course social disadvantage, accelerated aging, and brain health endpoints have been grossly understudied and are crucial to developing appropriate prevention and intervention strategies geared toward reducing and ultimately eliminating race-related health disparities in brain aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pronounced racial disparities are observed across multiple clinical and subclinical brain health endpoints in African Americans compared to Whites and may be attributable, in part, to accelerated age-related disease processes. Great public health relevance lies in our ability to understand the relation of racial disparities in early life social disadvantage to subclinical markers of brain pathology predictive of future clinical endpoints such as stroke, dementia, and cognitive and physical decline in African Americans, and related multi-level mediators of this relation. Such research can facilitate development of appropriate strategies in prevention and intervention critical to the reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities in multiple brain health endpoints.","Race, Childhood Social Disadvantage, and the Adult Brain: HANDLS BRAINCHILD.",9509324,K01AG043581,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maryland ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"Life Course Process of Alzheimer's Disease: Sex Difference and Biosocial Mechanisms Abstract The proposed research addresses two fundamental problems in population research on the Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) sex disparities in cognitive decline with aging, and (2) interplay of social and biological pathways that generate and sustain AD disparities. Our proposal breaks new ground with an innovative life- course research design that conjoins prospective cohort data from five large-scale NIH population-based longitudinal studies that collectively cover the adult life span. We will conduct integrative data analysis in response to an increased demand for replicability of scientific findings across independent studies and make efficient use of extant resources in the pursuit of a cumulative science. We will apply novel statistical methods to model longitudinal sex differences in age trajectories of cognitive functioning from young to late adulthood and incidence of AD in old age. We will examine social and biological mechanisms influencing cognitive trajectories and sex differences. Tested mechanisms will include social stress related to socioeconomic status (SES) and social relationships, and biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic, neuroendocrine, and immune pathways implicated in AD. We will also test and integrate new biological data on immune function. Project Narrative The proposed project will examine the process of age change in cognitive function in relation to risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) throughout the adult life span and how such process is different for men and women. It seeks to better understand how social disadvantages such as low socioeconomic status and social isolation “get under the skin” to influence biological pathways to cognitive health as individuals age. It contributes new knowledge that is critical for identifying the life stages in which intervention might be most effective, targeting AD prevention and treatment in men and women, and informing

"17-beta-estradiol protects critical hippocampal synaptic circuits during asymptomatic disease in the novel TgF344-AD rat Project Summary This proposal aims to determine mechanisms by which the neuroprotective hormone 17-estradiol (E2) improves and maintains hippocampal synaptic signaling during presymtomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology using the novel comprehensive TgF344-AD rat model. The earliest and most insidious stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are characterized by altered brain function at the level of the synapse. Patholgoy begins in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and spreads via functionally connected synapse to the hippocampus. Both brain regions are critical to learning and memory. As soluble toxic species of amyloid beta oligomers and hyper-phosphorylated tau rise, EC-to- hippocampal synaptic weakening results and occurs decades prior to clinical presentation of cognitive symptoms. Ovarian hormones play a delicate role in modulating synaptic circuits and cognitive function. Rapid loss of ovarian hormones as a natural part aging in women is now recognized as a risk factor for the development of AD. 17-estradiol (E2) and its replacement post-menopause benefits neuron function, amyloid and tau pathology, and cognition, yet how E2 improves or maintains synaptic processes underlying cognitive function throughout early asymptomatic and symptomatic disease progression are unknown. Our lab has established that E2-enhanced hippocampal synaptic strength and cognitive performance, in non- diseased rodents, is due to its ability to increase synaptic current mediated by glutamate receptor subunit epsilon- 2 (GluN2B) –containing N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Current evidence in presymptomatic transgenic rodent models show early hippocampal synaptic deficits result from loss of beneficial synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs transmission, while extrasynaptically located GluN2B-NMDARs are pathologically stimulated due to excessive extracellular glutamate. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that E2 is beneficial to synaptic function in early AD by enhancing synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR current and synaptic strength in the dentate gyrus, the primary target region of synaptic projections from EC. Data obtained in this proposal will bolster previous evidence of E2’s neuroprotective actions against Alzheimer’s disease pathology as well as establish novel therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) targets the entorhinal cortex in the earliest phase of the disease. Although more women than men are diagnosed with AD, likely due to loss of estrogen in menopause, little is known regarding how it protects synaptic function during disease progression. Using the novel TgF344-AD rat model, proposed studies investigate beneficial effects of estrogen on dentate gyrus function during presymptomatic disease.",17-beta-estradiol protects critical

"Chronic Stressors, Brain Vasculature, and Cognitive Function in African-American Women PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this project is to determine whether and how chronic psychosocial stressors might contribute to pre-clinical correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke in African-American women at midlife. It is well documented that older African-Americans have significantly higher rates of AD and stroke than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. However, in most studies of individuals over age 65, these disparities are already present, suggesting that factors responsible for the disparity occur much earlier in life. As the field has shifted to understanding the earliest changes in cognitive aging, the proposed project provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate novel risk factors for adverse brain health in a recently funded study of vascular aging in African-American women aged 35-45. We will recruit a subsample of 100 African- American women of varying educational backgrounds from the parent study reporting high and low levels of chronic stress, respectively (N=50 from each group). Validated questionnaires will be utilized to measure overall chronic stress as well as chronic stressors known to be common among African-American women (i.e. discrimination, financial strain, neighborhood stressors and inadequate emotional support). Primary aims will compare high vs. low stress women on 1) measures of brain structure and vasculature (e.g. hippocampal volume and corticol thickness, microvascular disease, cerebral blood flow) using state of the art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques; as well as 2) cognitive function, using a brief neuropsychological battery. We will also examine whether established (nocturnal blood pressure, arterial stiffness) and novel (regenerative capacity) markers of overall vascular risk impact these outcomes among African-American women in the target age range. The overall objective of this R21 project is to obtain effect sizes for a larger, prospective, R01- funded study. The long-term goal of this program of research is to understand the impact of and pathways through which chronic stress contributes to risk for AD and stroke in an understudied, yet vulnerable group of women. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-Americans bear a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke compared to Whites, and vascular disease has emerged as one important pathway through which African-American “race” impacts AD and stroke in later life. “Midlife” represents a critical window for early prevention among African- Americans, particularly African-American women, as recent data indicate that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of vascular disease that are higher than those of other race-sex groups. The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether chronic stressors known to impact African-American women contribute to pre-clinical correlates of AD and stroke at midlife in this at-risk subgroup.","Chronic Stressors, Brain Vasculature, and Cognitive Function in African-American Women",9470844,R21AG055995,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Parents ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stress ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Woman ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Physical activity ', ' cerebrovasculature ', ' cerebral vasculature ', ' cerebral blood vessel ', ' brain vasculature ', ' Cerebrovascular system ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' Funding ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Hour ', ' psychosocial ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' artery stiffness ', ' artery stiffening ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' sex ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' regenerative ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' brain health ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,117000,-0.0370574763794835
"Race/ethnic disparities and the incidence and over- or under-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY At the national level, there has been significant interest in addressing U.S. health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Although there is growing evidence to suggest race/ethnic disparities in dementia exists in the U.S., much of the evidence of disparities is indirect or comes from geographically- localized studies that may not be generalizable to the experience of Americans as a whole. Furthermore, there is little evidence to indicate whether disparities are widening or shrinking over time. Thus, the aims of this proposal are to (1) describe race/ethnic disparities in the incidence of experiencing Alzheimer's disease and related dementia at the national level in the U.S. and examine the extent to which race/ethnic disparities in incidence have changed over time, and (2) describe race/ethnic disparities in over- or under-diagnosis of prevalent Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the medical setting at the national level in the U.S. and examine the extent to which race/ethnic disparities in under- or over-diagnosis have changed over time. To accomplish these aims, we will use data from the nationally representative U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), and linked Medicare data. For Aim 1, we will build on previous work creating algorithms to predict dementia status from ADAMS using only HRS data (ADAMS participants are sampled from HRS) in order to create an improved algorithm with optimal validity across and within race/ethnic groups. We will then apply this algorithm to assign dementia status to each eligible HRS participant at each HRS interview. From this we will derive age-standardized estimates of dementia incidence in HRS by race/ethnic group (self-reported non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic) over two time periods, 1998-2004 and 2006-2012. For Aim 2, we will use Medicare claims data to determine whether each eligible HRS participant had a diagnosis of dementia prior to or within 1 year after each HRS interview. We will then estimate agreement between the Medicare-based and algorithmic dementia diagnosis assigned at each HRS interview from 1998 to 2012 within race/ethnic groups to quantify disparities and temporal trends in over- or under-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. This contribution is expected to be significant as it will provide (i) national and historical benchmarks against which to compare current and future data on local race/ethnic disparities in both the incidence and over- or under- diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; (ii) evidence summarizing temporal changes in race/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; (iii) improved algorithms for diagnosis of dementia in HRS that maximize validity in minority populations; and (iv) evidence for the feasibility of linking of multiple data sources to provide valid estimates of race/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the U.S. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study represents a critical first step towards addressing race/ethnic health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the U.S, as until we can quantify the extent of the problem and understand how it has changed with time, we cannot hope to adequately address it. Ultimately, the proposed work will inform future efforts to develop a national monitoring system for race/ethnic health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",Race/ethnic disparities and the incidence and over- or under-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the United States,9479671,R03AG055485,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Planning ', ' plan health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' effective intervention ', ' Medicare claim ', ' health data ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Time trend ', ' ']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,79750,0.17218762450730835
"Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer Project Summary Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have several similarities including increasing age as a major risk factor, higher frequency of apolipoprotein E ε allele in both, etc. Several population based studies have confirmed a close association between PCa and AD, where PCa patients are at a higher risk for AD development; and AD patients have higher possibility of developing PCa. Few studies have also reported the direct effect of gonadal hormones on amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Consequently, anti-androgen therapy in PCa patients increases plasma Aβ levels, and significantly increases the risk for dementia associated with AD and vascular cognitive impairment. Overall, PCa and AD seem to share similar pathogenesis pattern. In the funded R01 application, we have propounded that social stress factors such as neighborhood environment, violence, racial segregation, and social isolation are associated with dysregulated hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the resultant biological stressors such as cortisol and leptin could alter the epigenome. Consequentially, PCa patients living in such adverse social environment are likely to experience different and highly complex biological manifestations due to such social-stress-modulated epigenetic response. We believe these socio- epigenome factors could be the one reason for PCa aggressiveness in African-Americans, a race that faces a serious PCa-related health disparity. Our goal in the funded R01 is to identify the role of miRNAs and stress hormones in prostate carcinogenesis in African Americans. Interestingly, higher cortisol levels are also associated with AD development. Based upon the strong association between PCa and AD, and the availability of serum samples from African American men (healthy and PCa) with distinct social backgrounds in the funded R01, in this application, we propose to assess whether social factors such as socio-economic status and differential stress hormone levels promote the AD risk in African American PCa patients. Following are the specific aims: (A) To characterize neuron-derived exosomes (NDE) and astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADE) from participants for AD-related biomarkers. We will isolate L1CAM+ NDE and GLAST+ ADE from the serum of 50 African Americans (healthy (n=25) and PCa (n=25) patients) and analyze for Aβ1-42 and tau (P-T181-tau, P-S396-tau and total tau) levels by ELISA, and correlate their expression with cortisol and leptin levels in the blood. Further, exosomes will be analyzed for their cargo (miRNAs and proteins) to assess expression of biomarkers associated with dementia (AD and vascular cognitive impairment). (B) To determine how NDE and ADE from participants affect synaptic function. Effect of exosomes (NDE and ADE) treatment will be analyzed on synaptic plasticity via assessing hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for memory. Further, hippocampal slices will be analyzed for synaptic biomarkers known to be dysregulated in AD and vascular cognitive impairment. Overall, outcomes of these studies will elucidate the effect of social stressors and stress hormones on AD-related biomarkers in African American men with PCa. Project Narrative Prostate cancer (PCa) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) both disproportionately affect African American men and have several similarities including increasing age as a major risk factor, higher frequency of apolipoprotein E ε allele in both, etc. Several population-based studies have confirmed a close association between PCa and AD, where PCa patients are at a higher risk for AD development; and AD patients have higher possibility of developing PCa. In this supplement application, we propose to assess whether social factors such as socio- economic status and differential stress hormone levels promote the AD risk in African American PCa patients. We will characterize neuron-derived exosomes (NDE) and astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADE) from healthy and prostate cancer patient participants for AD-related biomarkers and determine how NDE and ADE from participants affect synaptic function.

"Reducing Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease: Role of ACOs SUMMARY  According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the age 85 and older population will be increasingly Black and Hispanic. Relative to non-Hispanic Whites, rates of cognitive impairment are higher among Blacks and Hispanics, and a growing body of evidence documents that minorities are diagnosed with later stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), experience poorer treatment outcomes, and have higher mortality rates. Taken together, these trends make clear a need to identify strategies that can reduce racial and ethnic disparities within AD.  One commonly proposed strategy has been care coordination. People with AD frequently need care from a wide range of providers, including geriatricians, specialists, nurse aides, and home health care workers. Given the multidisciplinary nature of AD care, improved care management can ensure that the requisite services are provided in a timely manner, particularly among minority populations which struggle with access to care. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether and how incentives for care coordination affect disparities.  In this proposal, we examine the role of Medicare ACOs in reducing racial and ethnic disparities within AD. Consisting of providers who are incentivized to coordinate and provide care for a defined population, ACOs have emerged as a prominent model of care. Existing literature has highlighted quality improvements at lower costs, but the ability of ACOs to affect prevailing disparities, particularly within AD, remains understudied.  Relying on rich administrative data and a quasi-random experimental approach, we will estimate the causal impact of Medicare ACOs on the diagnosis of AD and use of medical services among AD patients by race. We will also assess the role of various patient- and system-level factors in reducing health disparities. Specifically, we will examine how the racial concordance between physicians and patients and how the racial composition of ACO physicians, the ACO governance board, and the ACO market area affect the ability of ACOs to reduce health disparities. In light of the expanding aging population and increasing share of minorities, this research provides needed evidence on how incentives for care coordination impact the health outcomes of minority AD populations. NARRATIVE With an aging population that is increasingly non-White, it is important address racial and ethnic disparities in AD health outcomes. The proposed research will identify how Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) differentially affected the diagnosis and treatment of AD among minority populations.",Reducing Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease: Role of ACOs,9765813,R01AG055401,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Generalists ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', "" Nurses' Aides "", ' Nursing Auxiliaries ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' aged 85 and older ', ' aged 85 and greater ', ' age 85 and older ', ' age 85 and greater ', ' 85+ years old ', ' human very old age (85+) ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' payment ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' beneficiary ', ' Instruction ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' Medicare claim ', ' patient population ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' treatment group ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' care costs ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,161651,0.1297694476509015
"Communities Designed to Support Cardiovascular Health for Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Business establishments hold potential to shape individual behaviors and experiences relevant to cognitive decline including mobility and management of Alzheimer's disease related dementias (ADRD). Policies impacting local business environments may prevent ADRD onset, extend years of healthy life, and facilitate independent living. The proposed project is leverages data we have assembled on business environments and other dynamic geographic contexts across decades to expand our CVD-focused work into the area of cognitive decline and ADRD. Longitudinal studies of local environments have been strongly recommended as future research to advance our understanding of causal neighborhood effects on health. The local density of businesses with potential relevance to health has changed over time, and such temporal fluctuations vary across regions, cities and neighborhoods. These differences can be used to investigate how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local context. Older adults who relocate to a new home address may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors, offering another window into causation. Attention is needed to cognitive changes that may precipitate relocation, and which local environment features predict aging in place despite new health or functional limitations. In the proposed project, we will link longitudinal data to investigate how neighborhood change and residential relocation shape cognitive decline, ADRD, and related health disparities. We will use the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database, a census of >58 million US business establishments, including annual point-level geocodes and business characteristics for the years 1990-2014,offering an opportunity to characterize changing business environments nationally at multiple spatial scales. Geographic context data (from NETS and longitudinal population, safety, and transportation data) will be linked to individual data from two cohort studies: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study, both of which have ADRD relevant cognitive measures and assessments. CHS is a well-characterized population-based study of 5,888 older adults (100% age 65+ at baseline, 58% female, 16% African American). A majority of the CHS participants enrolled 1990-1993 from four US sites have been followed prospectively, with longitudinal cognitive assessments and adjudicated dementia status during follow-up. REGARDS is a prospective population-based cohort study, including oversampling of African Americans and Stroke Belt residents. The 30,239 REGARDS participants (49% age 65+ at baseline,55% female,42% African American) were enrolled in 2003-2007, from the 48 contiguous US states, and cognitive assessments were administered throughout follow-up allowing cognitive function and decline to be investigated. For both cohorts, longitudinal addresses have been georeferenced and surrounding areas characterized. This project brings unparalleled geographic resources along with comprehensive cohort data to inform how community design can support healthy aging. Narrative The proposed project is designed to investigate the bidirectional relationship between local neighborhood contexts and cognitive decline. We will use unparalleled geographic data resources along with population based cohort data to inform how community design can support healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease prevention.",Communities Designed to Support Cardiovascular Health for Older Adults,9711190,R01AG049970,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Independent Living ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Urbanization ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Mediating ', ' density ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Supermarket ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' social ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Geographic state ', ' US State ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' land cover ', ' healthy aging ', ' population based ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' greenspace ', ' Green space ', ' walkable ', ' walkability ', ' data resource ', ' Stroke Belt ', ' ']",NIA,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,372944,0.04420637000428143
"Tau PET imaging in racially/ethnically diverse middle-aged adults PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most devastating international public health epidemics. There are currently no effective disease-modifying or preventative strategies. Current pathogenic models of AD emphasize a precipitating role of beta amyloid (Aβ) pathology, which stimulates tau deposition, neurodegeneration, and cognitive dysfunction. But recent work suggests that tau deposition frequently occurs prior to Aβ, could begin in midlife, and could be potentiated by other factors, including cerebrovascular disease. Tau pathology may play a role in AD racial/ethnic disparities, as the incidence and prevalence of AD is greater among African Americans and Hispanics, who have greater exposure to vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease. Thus, there are likely multiple pathways beginning in midlife that promote tau deposition and cognitive decline associated with AD, which may vary across racial/ethnic groups. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which tau deposition is related to cognitive function, to determine whether tau deposition varies across racial/ethnic groups, and to determine the extent to which cerebrovascular disease is associated with tau pathology in midlife. We will obtain tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging among 150 middle-aged adults who are receiving high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, Aβ PET, and comprehensive clinical evaluation as part of their participation in a study titled “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease” (RF1 AG054070, MPI: J.J. Manly/A.M. Brickman). The aims of the proposed project are: 1. To determine whether tau pathology is associated with cognitive functioning in midlife. We hypothesize that increased tau deposition in the medial temporal lobes will be associated with poorer episodic memory functioning and odor identification deficits. 2. To determine whether tau pathology differs across racial and ethnic groups in midlife. We hypothesize that Hispanics and African Americans will have greater amounts of tau pathology relative to non-Hispanic Whites. 3. To determine whether markers of cerebrovascular disease are associated with tau pathology in midlife and whether race/ethnicity moderates this association. We hypothesize that magnetic resonance imaging-derived markers of cerebrovascular disease, including white matter hyperintensities, infarcts, and microbleeds, will be associated with increased tau. We also expect that the relationship between markers of cerebrovascular disease and tau pathology will vary across racial/ethnic groups. Successful completion of this study will potentially point to novel intervention targets for the prevention of AD in addition to identifying sources of racial/ethnic disparities in the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase, yet the causes of this devastating disease are poorly understood. This project will examine the degree to which markers of AD pathology are associated with cognition in midlife and differences in AD biomarkers across racial/ethnic groups. It will also examine the role of cerebrovascular disease in promoting AD pathology to provide novel mechanistic insight into these disease and help identify new targets for intervention during midlife.",Tau PET imaging in racially/ethnically diverse middle-aged adults,9602676,RF1AG058067,"['Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infarction

"A mobile self-compassion intervention for Hispanic Dementia Caregivers Project Summary: One in 10 older Americans has Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or related dementia (age 65+), placing a substantial burden of caregiving on family caregivers (15+ million), the hidden patients at high risk for stress (60%) and depressive symptoms (33%) related to the difficulties of dementia caregiving. A caregiver group, greatly impacted by dementia, is Hispanic, the largest minority (16% of US population), largely neglected by the healthcare system with many health disparities and barriers: higher incidence of Alzheimer’s (e.g. 63% versus 30% for Caucasians age 85 years and over); greater depressive symptoms in Hispanics (45%) than in other groups; limited medical insurance; language proficiency issues; lack of knowledge about dementia; greater need for help to deal with difficulties related to dementia, etc. As efficient, low-cost, culturally tailored, and accessible interventions are needed to cope with dementia caregiving, we propose a new intervention, called “Self-Compassion Coping for dementia caregivers” (SCC), to be implemented in the Caring Compassion App (CCA), specifically designed for Hispanic caregivers on how to cope with dementia caregiving, reduce burden of care, decrease stress, and alleviate depressive symptoms. There many predictors of stress related to caregiving, including the sense of competence, guilt, available resources, and skills on how to deal with caregiving challenges. Although some studies have shown that self- compassion and other interventions can improve caregiver well-being, there is a lack of evidence-based products that can be easily deployed in a cost-effective manner to support Hispanic dementia caregivers. CCA will feature self-compassion practices to ease caregiving stress, in addition to techniques, skills, and practical tips on caregiving coping in a self-contained, easy-to-use, low-cost, and convenient mobile app. Research on Mobile App-based self-compassion interventions for caregiving is an unexplored field. CCA is one of the first (if not the first one for dementia caregivers). The novel CCA incorporates: (a) Self-Compassion; (b) psychoeducation and effective skill-based caregiving coping training to reduce stress/depressive symptoms; (c) implementation of the curriculum into a culturally sensitive Mobile App for Hispanics; and (c) convenient use of a Mobile App to engage users to follow the intervention. Related clinical advantages are: encourage caregiver participation, facilitate intervention, and enable better assimilation of skills; which should enhance caregivers’ skills to deal with demanding tasks of caregiving, reduce burden of care, improve quality of life, decrease stress, and help to alleviate depressive symptoms. In partnership with the Alzheimer’s Association, expert Advisory Board and caregivers, we will develop the SCC curriculum in Phase I. Focus groups involving caregivers will inform the project and explore caregiver attitudes towards self-compassion, mobile app usage, and proposed curriculum. In addition, a prototype will be developed and tested with dementia caregivers to establish the feasibility of the approach in Phase I. Public Health Relevance Depression and stress affect a large population of 15+ million family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementia in US, impacting the Hispanic American community greatly, which is both the largest minority (16% of the US population) and the fastest growing ethnic group, with an expected elderly (age 65+) population increase from 3 million (2008) to 17 million (2050). Dementia poses unique challenges to the Hispanic community, with much higher rates of Alzheimer’s disease (63% vs 30% for Caucasians age 85+) and higher depression (45% of Hispanic caregivers vs 33% of all caregivers), in addition to several barriers to care, such as lower levels of medical insurance, household income, English language proficiency, and education; which intensify Hispanic caregiver needs for dementia programs and help on how to deal with difficulties related to dementia, specifically tools and culturally appropriate interventions on coping with caregiving. The expected outcomes following our project’s completion (Phase II) are linked to decreasing the caregiving burden for Hispanic dementia caregivers, with reduced stress/depressive symptoms; in addition, we also foresee indirect outcomes (not measured by this study) to improve caregiver quality of life, extend the time dementia patients can remain under family care and residence, reduce caregiver medication use, and thus decrease nationwide healthcare costs.",A mobile self-compassion intervention for Hispanic Dementia Caregivers,9534449,R43AG059327,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', '

"Characterizing disparities in late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk through polygenic risk and epidemiologic factors in the Health and Retirement Survey PROJECT SUMMARY Late-onset Alzheimer's dementia (LOAD) is terminal and the most prevalent form of dementia (70% of cases). LOAD is a major public health burden in the US with current prevalence estimates of 4 to 5 million adults and economic costs exceeding $236 billion annually. Important disparities in LOAD prevalence occur with sex, race/ethnicity, education, and residence. The biological bases of these health disparities are incompletely characterized and their influences on LOAD are likely to be multifactorial. Thus, studies with sufficient sample sizes, concurrently assessing multiple characteristics, such as educational attainment, environment, social, behavioral, lifestyle, geographic, and genetics, will be uniquely positioned to effectively test factors or combinations of factors that create and sustain LOAD disparities. Our goal is to determine the joint genetic and environmental contributions to LOAD risk that underlie these health disparities. Using existing genomics data, well-characterized dementia phenotypes, and diverse risk factor data, we will analyze up to 16,000 aging participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), attempt clinical confirmation in participants of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) sub-cohort of the HRS, and test replication in other clinical and population-based samples. Our aims are to (1) determine the cumulative genetic risk of LOAD by testing the association between cognitive polygenic scores and risk of dementia phenotype in European and African ancestries; (2) determine the polygenic effect of LOAD risk covariates from behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial domains on dementia phenotypes in European and African ancestries; and (3) test for effect modification of the association between polygenic risk and dementia phenotype in European and African ancestries by health disparities factors (sex, education, urban/rural residence). This study will likely impact the field of Alzheimer's research and contribute to public health because it will a) establish the relevance of cumulative genetic risk on LOAD in susceptible populations where genetics may be a more relevant factor; b) elucidate important biological mechanisms through polygenic scores; c) determine the combined and individual gene-environment contribution to LOAD risk; d) generate unified polygenic scores and dementia phenotypes across major longitudinal cohorts involving diverse populations that can be used in future investigations of health outcomes and/or additional exposure domains; e) consider the effects of sex, educational attainment, ancestry, and urban/rural status in the same study where comparisons of relative contribution to risk can be made. We have the opportunity to simultaneously and significantly improve our understanding of the genetic and environmental etiologic contributions to health disparities in LOAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall purpose of this proposal is to establish the relevance of polygenic risk in susceptibility to dementia, particularly among groups at increased risk of disease, including women, minorities, rural inhabitants, and those with low educational attainment. Because an individual's susceptibility to dementia is likely a combination of genetics and environmental risk factors, we will jointly test the effects of cumulative genetic risk and dementia risk factors in our analysis. The proposal provides an opportunity to identify a genetic etiologic component in vulnerable groups that could lead to mechanistic understanding or targeted interventions to substantially benefit

"Incident Vascular Brain Injury, Probable Alzheimer's Disease, and Cognitive Change in Elderly American Indians PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A workshop convened in 2013 by National Institute of Aging and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke prioritized research on cognitive impairment of multiple etiologies, contributions of vascular brain injury (VBI) to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and disparities involving race, ethnicity, socioeconomics, and rural residence. VBI is a leading cause of accelerated brain aging and a major risk factor for stroke, cognitive decline, depression, and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few studies have evaluated VBI, cognitive impairment, and AD in American Indians (AIs), who bear a heavy burden of risk factors for these conditions. This exclusion is unfortunate, since the distinctive history, risk profiles, environmental stressors, social environments, and healthcare systems of AIs likely result in patterns of disease that differ substantially from other populations. Our research team has conducted the only cohort study to date of covert VBI in AIs. In 2010-2013, Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians study completed standardized clinical examinations, neuropsychological testing, and cranial MRI on more than 1,000 AIs aged 64-95 years from 10 tribes in 3 states. In 2016, we began re-examination of surviving participants using the same protocols, augmented by assessment for probable AD. However, the particular grant mechanism from the National Institute on Aging that provides funding for this follow-up examination is limited to data collection, with no resources allocated for analysis. In this proposal, we will capitalize on the accumulated longitudinal data to apply sophisticated imaging and analysis methods to quantify and evaluate associations for incident VBI, neurodegeneration, and changes in cognitive status in this elderly minority population. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) establish normative and diagnostic standards for mild cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly AIs, and evaluate associations and determinants for incident VBI, cerebral atrophy, cognitive decline, and probable AD; (2) conduct cluster analyses to identify novel neuroimaging profiles that predict subgroups of elderly AIs at highest risk for cerebral atrophy, cognitive decline, and probable AD; and (3) complete a rigorous career development plan that will position the applicant as an independent investigator and leader in innovative neuroepidemiology research with minority populations. This proposal leverages a timely opportunity to generate the first population-based estimates of and address novel scientific questions on VBI and cognitive impairment in AIs, a minority population with pervasive health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE American Indians bear a disproportionate burden of the complications of cardiovascular risk, which may cause damage to the brain and result in cognitive impairment. In addition, little is known about other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, in this group. We will establish the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes related to new onset of these conditions, and of problems in memory, concentration, and thinking among American Indians residing across three regions of the US.","Incident Vascular Brain Injury, Probable Alzheimer's Disease, and Cognitive Change in Elderly American Indians",9599353,K01AG057821,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older

"Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment among Mexican Americans PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this research is to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI): (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early detection and treatment. AD is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia and the 5th leading cause of death for those over 65 (8th leading cause of death for U.S. Hispanics). AD has an annual health care cost that is greater than that of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. While death rates from CVD and cancer have declined in recent decades, death rates have steadily increased for AD. The Mexican American elderly population is among the fastest growing segments of the population; however, little research on MCI and AD has been conducted among this underserved group. Here we will leverage our ongoing Health & Aging Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE) study to identify different pathways for MCI and AD among Mexican Americans, define subtle neuroanatomical and blood-based biomarker changes that are related to future risk of MCI and AD as well as provide evidence to support the utility of our AD blood-based detection tool that can be implemented in primary care settings. The current research team consists of leading experts in Mexican American cognitive aging, the epidemiology of MCI and AD as well as biomarkers of MCI and AD (neuroimaging and blood-based). The project will leverage a substantial existing infrastructure and HABLE cohort to address the two health disparities outlined above through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 - Examine the impact of higher rates of metabolic burden and depressive symptomatology on MCI and AD among community-dwelling Mexican Americans; Specific Aim 2 - Examine neuroimaging and blood-based biomarkers associated with MCI and AD among Mexican Americans; and Specific Aim 3: Validate our blood-based AD screening tool as the first-step in a multi-stage diagnostic process among Mexican Americans. The current project will address significant health disparities faced by Mexican American elders suffering from and at risk for MCI and AD. The identification of novel pathways related to disproportionate burden of diabetes and depression can lead to novel ethnic-specific interventions. The identification of a blood-based screening tool for AD will provide primary care providers a way of meeting the needs of a rapidly growing elderly Mexican American population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly growing number of patients suffering from Alzheimer's (AD), little work has been conducted on AD among Mexican Americans. Here we propose to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from AD (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early diagnosis methods. The relevance of this project is the identification of potentially different pathways to AD among Mexican Americans (directly related to increased rates of diabetes and depression and the health disparity of earlier age of onset) as well as the provision of a blood-based screening tool for AD that can be implemented in primary care clinics.",Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild

"The Role of Physician Networks on Racial Disparities in Intensity of Care for Dementia Patients PROJECT SUMMARY    Alzheimer’s disease and other related dementias (ADRD) are widely acknowledged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older populations. There are racial disparities in prevalence, with older African-Americans being twice as likely as older whites of having ADRD, with more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Treatment intensity of people with ADRD is well documented to differ by race, including differences in health services received such as medication use and end of life care patterns. For example, African-Americans have 1.77 times the risk of having a feeding tube placed at the end of life than white patients. While differences in patient preference across racial and ethnic groups are documented, one major gap in our knowledge is what role physician practice characteristics have on disparities. While disparities could exist because the same physician is treating African-American and white patients differently, an alternative could be that people of different races with ADRD are seen largely by different physicians, with varying experience with either dementia or racial minorities. Furthermore, physicians seeing minority dementia patients may be in completely different physician “networks,” meaning minorities see physicians who have differential connections to providers with specialized ability to diagnose and treat people with dementia.    The influence of physician professional connections on behavior can be studied by drawing on methods developed for the study of social networks. Social networks are structural representations of social interactions and personal or professional relationships. For physicians, social networks consist of colleagues with whom they share information, which can be measured by inferring connections when physicians share patients. The goal of this R03 is to develop preliminary data and methods to study the influence of social networks of physicians on disparities in end of life (EOL) care delivered to white and African-American Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. We propose to address these questions developing social networks of physicians who provide EOL care to dementia patients, stratified by race, and study how these networks are associated with the quality and racial disparities of that care. Thus, this R03 is designed to: (1) construct and summarize physician patient-sharing networks for dementia patients and describe the relationship between network characteristics of their predominant provider of care and end of life outcomes; and (2) elucidate the relationship between physician patient-sharing networks and the disparities by race in intensity and quality of care received at the end of life for dementia patients. With greater understanding of the relationship between disparities in quality of care and physician networks, this R03 will form the basis for future research at Dartmouth to inform new areas of health economic and services research, and potentially many other questions regarding physician influence of healthcare quality and use for people with Alzheimer’s disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older populations. As the baby-boomer generation ages, it is critical that we understand how to assure that all older adults receive high quality care by addressing racial disparities in care. This project will provide important information about whether changing the way physicians interact with each other could be a mechanism for reducing racial disparities in end of life care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.",The Role of Physician Networks on Racial Disparities in Intensity of Care for Dementia Patients,9475718,R03AG055809,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Behavior ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', "" Physician's Practice Patterns "", "" Physician's Role "", ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Probability ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Enteral Feeding ', ' tube feeding ', ' gastric feeding ', ' feeding tube ', ' enteric feeding ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' end of life care ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Medicare claim ', ' patient population ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' dementia care ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' baby boomer ', ' ']",NIA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R03,2018,81000,0.06140104917363682
"Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease progression; and amyloid- directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD. For ~10 years, the Principal Investigator has conducted studies on the effects of fitness adaptation on cardiovascular (CV) health. Recently, he received 2 years of funding to examine the effects of 3-times/week 6-month aerobic exercise-training on cognition in the laboratory setting. This ongoing study has allowed the Principal Investigator to demonstrate the ability to recruit, enroll, test, collect and manage related neuroimaging pilot data in a predominantly AA sample. While such a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation, such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of cognitive deterioration. To logically extend this ongoing work, he seeks to initiate an 18-month study, testing real-life applicability o the effects of exercise adaptation on memory in a more ideal community setting. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach will bolster retention. The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up) aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. We will test our hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and 2.) stretch-exercise (control). We proposed that the aerobic-exercise group will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, we will determine whether training- induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain volume. Explanatorily, we will also investigate intervention effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1α) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition. A team of experienced investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations supported by DCOA), we will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the aerobic-exercise group will follow a  prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using appropriate multivariate methods. While we remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of our ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 8 months) and therefore allow for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures; test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory. Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical, psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia constituting ~2/3 of all late-life cases. Based on 2011 estimates, the annual health care cost for dementia is ~$183 billion. Given this staggering cost, and the projected increase in elderly population by the year 2030, identifying effective mechanisms to ward off structural and functional declines associated with AD is an important public health goal as evidenced by recent presidential initiatives (reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for, persons with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease). Unfortunately, this  well-intended public health goal cannot be achieved without an effective dementia preventive strategy. Fortunately, lifestyle-induced preservation of intellectual dexterity among those showing earliest symptoms of cognitive deterioration may ameliorate the physical, emotional, and economic burden associated with loss of cognitive vitality. If proven and properly directed in African Americans, such intervention can further reduce health disparity.","Genes, Exercise, Neurocognitive and Neurodegeneration: Community-Based Approach",9472998,R01AG045058,"['Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Apolipoprotein E ', ' ApoE ', ' Apo-E ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cerebral Hypoxia ', ' Cerebral Tissue Hypoxia ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cholinesterase Inhibitors ', ' Anticholinesterases ', ' Anticholinesterase Drugs ', ' Anticholinesterase Agents ', ' Anti-Cholinesterases ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Life Course Determinants of Epigenetic Age Acceleration and Subsequent Dementia PROJECT ABSTRACT  This proposal seeks to understand the impact of interactions between socioeconomic status (SES), genotype, and health behaviors on disparities in epigenetic age acceleration and cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. Under the guidance of primary mentor Dr. Sharon Kardia, the training and research plan will build upon Dr. Schmitz's expertise in health economics and genetic epidemiology to prepare her for an independent career that integrates social science, genetics, and epigenetics into aging research. The PI will pursue a program of training in epigenetics at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health that will advance her knowledge and skills in (1) epigenomic biology, (2) bioinformatics and related general programming, and (3) preprocessing and analysis of DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray data.  The proposed research plan will capitalize on a large sample of epigenome-wide data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (N=4,000) to construct measures of DNAm age in whole blood and test for associations with known genetic, social, and behavioral mechanisms of aging and cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. DNAm age been shown to predict age with high accuracy, and studies have linked positive deviations between DNAm age and chronological age (i.e. epigenetic age acceleration (age)) with age-related diseases and mortality, suggesting that epigenetic processes may play a role in healthy aging. However, few studies have investigated pathways between age and SES, and to date no study has evaluated whether the relationship between age and SES is moderated by genetic influences or mediated by risky health behaviors. This work builds on Dr. Schmitz's prior HRS research that used whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) and objective measures of the social environment to examine the effect of gene-environment interactions on physical health and cognitive function at older ages.  During the K99 phase, Dr. Schmitz will construct measures of DNAm age in the HRS to test for associations between age and disadvantaged SES, risky health behaviors, and demographic characteristics using longitudinal moderation-mediation methods. During the R00 phase, Dr. Schmitz will incorporate PGSs into the analyses to assess whether genetic propensity for educational attainment or cognition moderates the relationship between SES, age, and subsequent declines in cognitive function and incidence of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Comparative analyses will be conducted in an African American oversample (Nൎ1,000). R00 research will employ instrumental variables (IV) and dynamic panel methods to draw stronger claims regarding causality. Following these analyses, replication of main findings will be pursued in multi-ethnic cohorts that have comparable genetic, epigenetic, and social data. Results from this research program may shed light on the specific social and biological mechanisms that underpin the SES-mortality gradient.

"In search of an ethno-culturally appropriate approach for the early identification of Cognitive Impairment in African Americans PROJECT/SUMMARY ABSTRACT Completion of the projects outlined will serve as the foundation for my career's focus on studying factors that are involved in both cognitive and functional disparity and identifying the optimal methodology to assess both in African Americans (AA). We propose to test, in a cohort of 330 study participants with prodromal Alzheimer Dementia (AD) (at least 40% AA) whether quickly administered tests of executive vs. global function will 1) better correlate with measures of day-to-day function; 2) more strongly correlate with progression to dementia; and 3) be mediated by vascular diseases, namely hypertension (HTN). 1. To identify the optimal cognitive marker that best predicts functional impairment in older AA. A1—Sub aim: To determine whether impairment in executive function is superior to memory recall in predicting functional impairment in older community-dwelling African Americans. Hypothesis 1: Compared to White participants, among older community-dwelling AA, measures of executive function will better predict functional outcomes than memory recall-based cognitive assessments alone. A2—Sub aim:To determine whether impairment in executive function is associated with future cognitive and functional decline in older community-dwelling AA and is to a greater extent than for Whites. Hypothesis 2: Compared to White participants, among older community-dwelling AA, measures of executive function will better predict future cognitive and functional decline than memory recall-based cognitive assessments alone. 2. To investigate the role of HTN, key vascular risk factor, in cognitive function disparity as measured NIHTB-CB & CLOX1 as well as global function measures (MoCA) among the aforementioned groups. Hypothesis 3: Greater prevalent HTN will partially explain the disparity between AA and Whites in global and executive function. The funding of the projects and activities outlined in this application will serve as critical “startup” resources that will 1) underwrite the development of a local research infrastructure for the Principal Investigator (PI); 2) provide fundamental research skill improvement; and 3) protect time for relevant projects and the writing of manuscripts to disseminate findings. This proposal builds on earlier work toward identifying a cognitive assessment method that is simultaneously and significantly correlated with function, having practical extension and use in primary care for the early identification of cognitive impairment in older community-dwelling African Americans. The data and experience obtained from completing the projects in this proposal will serve as preliminary data for a planned application to further investigate factors in racial disparity in cognitive and functional impairments. PROJECT NARRATIVE This scope of research will test assessments designed to measure cognition in order to identify the best cognitive marker correlated with day-to-day function in older African Americans. These assessments are brief in their duration and will serve to identify a rapid strategy for the early identification of cognitive impairment in African Americans in primary care clinical environments. Additionally, we will investigate whether hypertension, widely prevalent in African Americans, partially explains the disparity between African Americans and Whites in global and executive functional impairment and progression to dementia and/or Alzheimer dementia.",In search of an ethno-culturally appropriate approach for the early identification of Cognitive Impairment in African Americans,9523333,R03AG056448,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Grant ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Failure ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' memory recall ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' daily functioning ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' fundamental research ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' vascular contributions ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' Physical Performance ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,117000,0.08331726225556013
"National Social Life and Aging Project:  Wave 4 The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study which extends our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. The project is unique among nationally representative studies of older adults in the breadth and detail of health data collected, incorporating physical, psychological, sensory, functional, cognitive and social measures. In particular, we have unparalleled longitudinal measures of changes in the structure of social networks and relationships of respondents and their partners throughout the study as well as information on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). We propose to conduct in-home interviews in 2020–21 (Wave 4 [W4]) with all surviving respondents and their spouses/partners from the first three waves (W1-W3), providing 15 years of follow-up and four waves of data on this important cohort (aged 72-100 at W4). For innovations introduced in W2— a multi-domain measure of cognition (the MoCA-SA), detailed olfactory assessment, complete data from spouses/partners, an accelerometry study of sleep and daily activity, and more comprehensive measures in all domains—W4 will provide a third data point needed to model changes in health, associations, and causal relationships between them. We will enhance the data with new measures of cognition, including item response times, proxy reports, and diagnosis of ADRDs; linking to administrative data files, such as Medicare; and objectively measuring, concurrently, all five classic senses. As one example, W4 will allow the testing of key hypotheses regarding cognitive changes from normal function through dementia, providing important insights into Alzheimer's disease.  With these data, we aim to extend our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. Additionally, we will develop a framework for enrolling the oldest NSHAP subjects into internal and external investigator initiated studies addressing novel social, behavioral, and clinical questions (such as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and related dementias) in representative samples of this historically understudied population. With its rich and novel measures of social networks and of the biological, physical and psychological components of health—all measured longitudinally from both partners in a couple—NSHAP is uniquely poised to bridge the gap between large, epidemiological studies of social relationships and health and experimental studies of the mechanisms involved. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study which extends our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. In 2020-21, NSHAP W4 will collect information on the health and wellbeing of Americans ages 72 to 100 and their partners.

"Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): India, the second-most populous country in the world, will soon experience rapid aging of its population. By 2050, India's older population (> 60 years old) is projected to reach 320 million (about the current size of the entire US population), representing an increase from 8 to 20 percent of its total population. The growing number of older people will drive a large increase in the prevalence of dementia in India, far exceeding the capacity of the private care system that currently predominates for the elderly. The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), a survey of 50,000 Indians representative of the older population across the nation and within its states and union territories, provides a unique opportunity to examine this and related issues. LASI is the most ambitious nationally representative study of the physical, mental, economic, and social well-being of the country's older population. Harmonized with other Health and Retirement Study (HRS) surveys, it offers an evidence base that can be used to compare the effects of social policies aimed at supporting older persons in India with policies used in other countries around the world. The objective of the proposed research is to supplement the current LASI in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in India. Previous efforts to identify dementia in developing nations have typically relied on non- representative samples in geographically restricted regions. In this application, we aim to develop a protocol for the assessment of dementia and MCI to be used within community settings in the ongoing, nationally representative LASI. To do so, we will first conduct in-depth cognitive testing for a sub-sample of LASI respondents at regional geriatric hospitals in India. Specifically, we will administer two leading dementia assessment protocols - the HRS Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) and the 10/66 Dementia Protocol - to approximately 2,000 respondents at least 60 years of age and stratified by their Wave 1 cognition test results, as well as their proximity to collaborating regional geriatic hospitals where the assessments will occur. Based on prognostic evaluation of the protocols, we will develop a short (15-minute) dementia assessment module and administer it in Wave 2 to persons with a high probability of having dementia and MCI as well as to the 2,000 persons participating in the earlier assessment. Using these data, we will estimate prevalence rates of dementia and MCI in India for the population and sub-populations. We will provide to the research community data generated from the in-depth cognitive testing at regional geriatric hospitals and from the administration of the short dementia assessment module during Wave 2, both linked to the on-going LASI main survey. Our harmonized protocol for dementia and MCI assessment will enable researchers to make comparisons with prior findings in India using the 10/66 protocol as well as to conduct cross-country studies with the United States, England, China, and other countries that implement the HRS HCAP protocol. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide a means for estimating the prevalence of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment for India that can be adapted to other harmonized surveys of aging in developing countries. The longitudinal nature of the project will provide insight on deterioration of cognitive abilities among the aged over time. The generated data will help researchers and policymakers determine the costs and burdens associated with providing care for older persons with diminished cognitive abilities.",Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI),9519797,R01AG051125,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Castes ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration / HMO ', ' Hospitals ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Social Policies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Spottings ', ' Sister ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Venous ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' mathematical ability ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' social wellbeing ', ' Social Well-Being ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' care giving burden ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' social situation ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' Physical Performance ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' health assessment ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,639075,0.09824972097763647
"Are there ethnic differences in brain amyloid and tau in the seventh decade of life? Our goal is to examine whether ethnic and racial differences in brain amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, the major neuropathology components of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), explain reported ethnic disparities in dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT) in Northern Manhattan We will examine ethnic differences in brain Aβ and tau, ascertained in-vivo with positron emission tomography (PET), among Hispanics, Non-Hispanic Blacks (Blacks), and Non-Hispanic Whites (Whites) aged 60 to 69 years from Northern Manhattan. We will also explore whether ethnic differences in brain Aβ and tau explain ethnic differences in memory performance, the earliest clinical marker of AD; whether ethnicity modifies the relation of APOE-ε4 and brain Aβ; whether ethnic disparities in literacy and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) moderate the association of brain Aβ and tau with memory performance. Lastly, we will explore whether the higher risk of DAT attributable to hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes) among Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites is explained by higher brain Aβ and tau. The risk of DAT is higher in elderly Blacks and Hispanics in Northern Manhattan compared with Whites. It is unknown whether this disparity is due to differences in AD neuropathology, CVD, CVD risk factors, or social determinants of health (SDOH). There is a paucity of studies of AD biomarkers in Blacks and Hispanics to answer this question, particularly in late middle age. We propose to address these gaps in knowledge taking advantage of an ongoing funded study of Aβ and tau PET (1R01AG050440, 3R01AG050440-02S1;09/01/15-05/31/20) in 100 Hispanics between 60 and 69 years of age at the time of brain imaging, a critical period for accumulation of AD neuropathology. We propose to extend this funded project to 100 Blacks and Whites aged 60 to 69 years from the same community in order to compare brain Aβ, tau, CVD, and cognition among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites in this understudied age group. We will ascertain brain Aβ using 18F-Florbetaben PET, and tau using 18F- THK-5351 PET at 2 time points 24 months apart. We will also conduct brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for co-registration of PET and for ascertainment of CVD (white matter hyperintensities and infarcts). Our primary aim is to examine whether there are ethnic differences in the presence of whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites aged 60 to 69 years from the community of Northern Manhattan. We will also explore across and within ethnic groups the association of whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, with memory performance, and moderation of this association by CVD and literacy. Secondary aim 1 is to compare the association of APOE-ε4 with whole brain fibrillar Aβ and tau across ethnic groups cross sectionally and longitudinally. Secondary aim 2 is to explore if ethnic disparities in hyperglycemia explain ethnic differences in whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex and memory impairment. We address the following objectives stated in in PAR-15-349: “Neuroimaging, neuropathology and the biology of AD”, “Analyses of pathways that create and sustain AD disparities”, and “Effect of Educational Attainment on Dementia Risk”. Our project is in line with the goals of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) by providing information that may explain the high burden of AD manifestations among Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites, and will addresses the paucity of AD biomarker data in the paucity of AD biomarker data in the seventh decade of life and in ethnic minorities.",Are there ethnic differences in brain

"Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center ABSTRACT - OVERVIEW The overall goal of the proposed renewal of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (Rush ADCC) is to continue to support the performance of cutting edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of MCI, AD, and other common dementias, by providing researchers with a stimulating multi-disciplinary environment, and unique and highly valued clinical and post-mortem data, and ante- and post-mortem biologic specimens. The Rush ADCC has been in continuous operation since 1991. It has eight Cores carefully designed to support a variety of timely and important areas of research including studies: 1) of the transition from normal aging to MCI and to the earliest stages of dementia with substantial participation by racial and ethnic minorities, 2) linking risk factors to normal aging, incident MCI and incident AD, and to post-mortem indices of AD and mixed pathologies, 3) that incorporate contemporary high throughput biochemical and molecular data into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, and 4) that link neuroimaging and biofluid biomarkers to contemporary biochemical and molecular data, 5) that support drug discovery pipelines, and 6) that support studies of impaired motor function. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADCC as a whole. The Clinical Core will collect UDS and additional data on Blacks without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Religious Orders Study (ROS) Core will follow older members of Catholic religious communities who have agreed to annual evaluation and brain donation at death. The Latino Core will collect the same data as in ROS on older Latinos without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Neuropathology Core will process, store, evaluate and distribute biospecimens obtained by the Clinical, ROS, and Latino Cores. The Outreach and Recruitment Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities into the Clinical and Latino Cores, and other NIA funded initiatives. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to provide the infrastructure that allows all other Cores to be maximally successful and impactful, and will provide statistical support to users of ADCC resources especially junior investigators and trainees. The new Research and Education Component will provide a structured program of mentorship across the ADCC, Rush University of the Rush ADCC strategic partners. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERVIEW The prevention of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia is a major public health priority.

"Risk Factors for Stroke and Cognitive Decline in a Tri-Ethnic Region ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke, cognitive impairment and dementia are increasing public health problems with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The National Alzheimer's Project Act and the NIH have recommended more extensive studies on the risk and determinants of dementia in disparities populations. Elucidation of the relationships between traditional and novel vascular risk factors for stroke, dementia, cognitive impairment, and disability is critical to enhance our ability to modify the risk of these conditions. The Northern Manhattan Study consists of a population-based cohort of 3497 stroke-free adults who have been followed annually for a median of 13.9 years. This collaborative prospective cohort study among whites, blacks, and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community is an outstanding resource to address health disparities involving faculty across three institutions (Columbia University, University of Miami, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). The cohort is well characterized and the 1290 subjects among the MRI sub-cohort have had a standardized brain MRI and two neuropsychological assessments over 5 years. The new aims are to determine the relationship between cognitive trajectories and a novel neuro-immune and inflammatory biomarker panel; determine the relationship between brain imaging biomarkers (regional brain volumes, regional white matter lesion burden, hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, small dilated perivascular spaces, dolichoectasia) and cognitive trajectories and dementia; determine the risk and vascular determinants of dementia; characterize the vascular determinants of functional impairment, disability, and quality of life; and assess the relationship between novel risk factors and specific ischemic stroke subtypes. To accomplish these aims, subjects will continue to be followed annually by telephone to ascertain stroke, MI, death and change in cognitive status, and more extensive functional assessments will be collected. A third expanded in-person neuropsychological assessment will be done among the MRI subcohort and a dementia consensus conference will ascertain and classify dementia. Stored plasma at the time of MRI will be used to measure an innovative inflammatory and immune biomarker panel, and new MRI measures will be analyzed on the already collected brain MRIs. The strengths of this prospective cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of novel serum biomarkers and brain imaging biomarkers, and the expanded focus on comprehensive outcomes including cognitive trajectories, dementia, functional impairment, and ischemic stroke subtypes. The results of these studies will be instrumental in the design of intervention programs to prevent stroke and cognitive decline in diverse populations and be a valuable shared data resource. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and dementia are increasing public health problems with a larger impact on blacks and Hispanics. Results from studying new blood and brain imaging factors will be instrumental in proposing interventions to prevent stroke and dementia in minority populations.",Risk Factors for Stroke and Cognitive

"Rhythm Experience and Africana Culture Trial (REACT) Abstract  African Americans are almost two times more likely than whites (i.e., Caucasians) to experience Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. For those over the age of 65, the prevalence of cognitive impairment is 8.8% in whites and 23.9% in African Americans. Even in the age range of 55-64, African Americans are 4 times more likely to experience cognitive impairment than their age-matched white counterparts. Increased risk of dementia among African Americans may be attributed to lower levels and quality of education, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and higher prevalence of vascular diseases, Type II diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, all of which are recognized as risk factors for dementia. A critical public health question emerges from these statistics that we intend to address in this proposal: Is there an effective method for reducing or eliminating the race disparities in cognitive and brain health? Fortunately, physical activity (PA) interventions may be effective at improving neurocognitive function and reducing risk for dementia. Despite these promising results, prior PA interventions have had few African Americans making it difficult to stratify results by race to determine whether African Americans respond to PA in a similar manner and magnitude as whites. In addition, the terms `physical activity' and `exercise' are often considered unpleasant, painful, and fatiguing, which can negatively influence interest, enrollment, and long-term adherence. Methods that increase PA without using the term PA (e.g., dancing) could be effective at improving health outcomes while simultaneously having a wider impact on translation and long- term adherence. Here we propose an innovative and culturally sensitive method of increasing PA in older (60- 80 yrs) African Americans. We propose a randomized intervention where 180 older African Americans are assigned to either a moderate intensity African Dance group 3 days per week (N=90) or to an African Education group 3 days per week (N=90) for 6-months. Both before and at the completion of the intervention, we will collect a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and MRI metrics of brain health and function to identify biological pathways by which PA influences neurocognitive health in an African American population. This proposal has the potential to utilize community-based activities to improve health of older African Americans. In addition, it could establish a platform (i.e., dance) to implement future interventions targeting minority populations to reduce health disparities. We have three primary aims: Aim 1. Examine whether a 6- month African Dance intervention improves cognitive performance compared to an educational control group. Aim 2. Examine whether African Dance influences brain morphology, task-evoked neural responses, cerebral blood flow, and resting state connectivity. Aim 3. Explore potential physiological and socioemotional mechanisms of the dance intervention. We will collect measures of physical and psychosocial health such as waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, mood, anxiety, depression, and loneliness and examine whether intervention-related changes to these measures mediate improvements in cognitive performance. Narrative In this randomized clinical trial, we will examine the effects of African Dance and Africana Education on cognitive and brain function in older African Americans. We will be collecting a battery of cognitive, neuroimaging, psychosocial, physical function measures, and blood-based biomarkers to examine the outcomes and mechanisms of the intervention.",Rhythm

"Understanding how physician cognitive biases affect the treatment of older adults with dementia and other vulnerable populations Project Summary Dan P. Ly, MD, MPP, is an inpatient teaching attending physician in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System and a PhD candidate in health policy (economics track) at Harvard University whose long- term interest is in improving the quality of care for vulnerable populations. This postdoctoral fellowship will help Dr. Ly develop into an independent investigator with expertise in physician decision-making. Dr. Ly's extensive programming experience with large databases and the substantial formal training he has received have prepared him to perform the proposed research. This proposal, on how cognitive biases among physicians may be exacerbated when caring for older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and for minority patients, builds on Dr. Ly's prior work on health care disparities by testing for a mechanism for such disparities. The training plan will build upon prior training through three goals: 1) gain guided experience with the care of older adults from specialists in dementia and geriatrics; 2) develop expertise in helping doctors make better decisions; and 3) acquire skills in methodology (e.g., qualitative and experimental methods) complementary to Dr. Ly's training in large database analysis. Dr. Ly will be mentored by Dr. David Cutler, a nationally-renowned health economist who is an eager and experienced mentor. His co-mentor is Dr. Anupam Jena, a physician and health economist with physician behavior expertise. Dr. Ly has assembled an advisory committee with expertises in gerontology, decision-making, statistics, management, and informatics. Quality of care is known to be suboptimal, particularly for older adults. As the population ages, it is important to identify barriers to delivering high-quality care to older adults. One set of barriers may be physician cognitive biases that may occur more often when caring for such patients, especially patients with conditions like ADRD that may make communication difficult. Some cognitive biases may also worsen when caring for racial and ethnic minority patients. Little is known about consequences of cognitive biases on a national scale for these vulnerable populations because the factors physicians weigh are often not in the claims data commonly used. Dr. Ly will use rich, national electronic health record data from the VA and focus on a common scenario: assessing patients with shortness of breath for the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). His project has three aims. First, he will examine whether physicians pay attention to objective clinical factors validated to correlate with PE risk and whether they also focus on arguably extraneous factors, such as diagnoses of recent patients seen (Aim 1). Second, he will determine whether physician attention on these objective factors is significantly lower for patients with ADRD (Aim 2). Third, he will examine whether this attention is also significantly lower for minority patients (Aim 3). This research may help explain deficiencies in quality of care for vulnerable populations and inform the design of future interventions to counter cognitive biases and improve care. Project Narrative As the population ages, how physicians care for an aging population—one in which prevalent conditions like Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) may make communicating with physicians challenging— is important to understand. Such communication difficulties may exacerbate known physician cognitive biases, which may adversely affect the quality of care patients with ADRD receive; these cognitive biases may influence the quality of care for minority patients as well. The proposed research will use rich, national electronic health record data to examine how cognitive biases among physicians may lead them to pay less attention to important clinical data in the medical record, which may inform the development of decision support tools to counter these cognitive biases and improve the quality of care for vulnerable populations.",Understanding how physician cognitive biases affect the treatment of older adults with dementia and other vulnerable populations,9609035,F32AG060650,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unconscious State ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Event ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' interest ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' clinical risk ', ' support tools ', ' racial minority ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,76858,0.018486847208210328
"Old SCHOOL Hip Hop: A randomized controlled trial to improve dementia knowledge Objectives: The goals of this proposal are to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel culturally- tailored dementia education intervention to a) teach young children to recognize dementia symptoms and demonstrate an appropriate action plan (which we have termed dementia literacy) and b) have these dementia literate children teach and improve dementia literacy their parents and grandparents. Background: Dementia is common among elderly individuals, becomes more prevalent with age, is medically refractory, reduces life expectancy, and diminishes quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Cultural barriers to dementia diagnosis exist and are potentially modifiable. Interventions that target younger generations may shift cultural perceptions and improve acceptance of dementia and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Emerging evidence suggests that early cognitive impairment may have modifiable or preventable components and a combination of medical and lifestyle interventions may delay or reduce cognitive decline, particularly when delivered early in the course of disease. Health literacy, including perceptions of cognitive aging and awareness of possible modifiable determinants, could be unrealized barriers to diminishing the health disparity of dementia. Youth education programs focused on dementia could increase community dementia awareness, improve AD literacy of parents and grandparents of dementia- literate children, shift cultural perceptions of AD to improve its acceptance, and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Such an approach could uniquely engage minority populations who are least engaged and at greatest risk for AD. Methods: The Intervention. “Old SCHOOL Hip Hop” (Seniors Can Have Optimal aging and Ongoing Longevity) is a validated model using a brief multimedia culturally tailored intervention designed to teach minority children key dementia signs and symptoms, and actions taken when dementia is recognized, which is early clinical evaluation by a physician. Twenty schools (with 3000 total students) will be randomly assigned to either the OSHH intervention arm or attentional control. This program will test the hypotheses that the program will lead to significant improvement of dementia knowledge in parents, and that gains are influenced by child knowledge, the degree of child-parent communication about the topic, and socioeconomic status. The program is additionally designed to create a novel, brief “dementia action test” to fulfill a critical missing tool for efficiently assessing dementia recognition and behavioral response. This project offers a unique opportunity effectively improve multigenerational community dementia knowledge in an era increasingly moving toward time-dependent multimodal disease modifying therapy. Our group's innovative model, pilot data, and recently completed and randomized controlled trial of a similar program in stroke support our approach and collective skill sets and experience providing an unparalleled opportunity to both meet project goals and establish several key steps to meaningfully impact dementia health literacy and potentially health outcomes including early access to

"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve access and engagement in AD research among disadvantaged groups.",Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research,9589379,K76AG060005,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' care episode ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Exclusion ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' ICD-10 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' AD detection ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' screening ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K76,2018,242555,0.13662078724809545
"Cognitive impairment in Mexican Americans: a population-based study Abstract Hispanic/Latinos will comprise more than 30% of the U.S. population by mid-century, and Mexican Americans account for the largest share of this growing segment of society. This proposal aims to use door-to-door surveillance in Nueces County, Texas, a non-immigrant, bi-ethnic community, to determine the prevalence and trajectory over time of cognitive impairment and dementia in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will elucidate the mechanisms that explain the hypothesized ethnic disparity in Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer-related dementias by evaluating the roles of vascular disease risk factors, educational attainment and socio-economic status among others. This research will also delve deeply into the differences in informal caregiving for Mexican American and non-Hispanic whites with cognitive impairment and dementia. Caregiver burden and mental and physical health of caregivers will be examined toward efforts to develop interventions that build resilience in caregivers. A novel ability of this population-based study is to examine community resources for both patients and caregivers, and how these provisions differ by ethnicity. Using a rigorous mixed methods approach we will identify the gap between available resources and needs for those with cognitive impairment and dementia. In this way we will be well positioned to propose ethnic-specific testable interventions that promote mental and physical health for those with cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as for those family members who provide the care. This research will therefore lead to improved well- being, autonomy and outcomes among those with cognitive impairment and dementia and their caregivers. The investigative team members have conducted research in this community for 20 years and are experts in Mexican American culture and health, cognitive impairment and dementia, epidemiologic methods, community needs assessment and health behavior research. As the Mexican American population continues its tremendous growth and aging it is vitally important to better understand the prevalence and outcomes of cognitive impairment and dementia in this population, and to rapidly develop interventions that address the burden of these common conditions in Mexican American adults, families, and communities.

"MRI markers of brain aging and risk factors for cognitive decline in older African Americans ABSTRACT The aging research community has identified numerous risk factors associated with the full spectrum of cognition including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and there is greater understanding of the underlying brain mechanisms. Unfortunately, the vast majority of knowledge comes from studies of primarily non-Hispanic Whites. Although African Americans bear a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment, the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying these disparities remain elusive. The overall goal of the proposed study is to investigate the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms linking culturally-relevant psychosocial risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD in older African Americans. Existing literature with MRI data in older African Americans has focused almost exclusively on cross-sectional associations of cognition or incident AD, and has examined traditional risk factors. Very few studies of African Americans have examined culturally relevant risk factors with repeated measures of cognitive function and brain integrity over time to test the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms linking risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD. We propose to interrogate changes in structural and functional integrity on MRI as key neurobiologic substrates linking these socially relevant risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD in African Americans. Leveraging the well-established infrastructure of the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), including available data on risk factors, and repeated measures of cognitive function, we will use a multi-modal neuroimaging approach to acquire antemortem MRI scans on 400 African Americans and quantify change in a number of brain MRI indices to address the Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine the relation of change in brain MRI indices with rate of cognitive decline and risk of AD among older African Americans; Aim 2 will examine the relation of early and mid-life cultural risk factors with change in structural and functional brain MRI indices among older African Americans; Aim 3 will determine if change in brain MRI indices affects the relation of early- and mid-life risk factors to rate of decline and risk of AD among older African Americans; and taking advantage of neuroimaging and cognitive function data available at no cost from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), Aim 4 will identify racial differences in the relation of change in MRI structural and functional brain integrity to cognitive decline. Cognitive impairment associated with aging is a large and growing public health problem that disproportionately burdens African Americans. Knowledge of the neurobiologic pathways linking risk factors to cognitive decline will ultimately provide targets for future prevention/intervention studies, and will have a strong and sustained impact on the field.

"BIOMARKERS AND DRIVING PERFORMANCE IN PRECLINICAL ALZHEIMER DISEASE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS AND CAUCASIANS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The goal of this pilot study is to examine whether aged African Americans and Caucasians differ in driving behaviors, and if so, whether these differences are linked to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) biomarkers, as well as vascular risk factors. Our research indicates that driving decline among older adults, an important functional outcome, is predicted by preclinical AD. However, little is known about driving behavior specifically in African American older adults. Closing this knowledge gap soon is critical, since African Americans are at twice the risk of symptomatic AD compared to Caucasians.  This research is significant because 36 million licensed drivers are aged 65 years or older, and the number of older adults in the United States is expected to double by 2050, when 1 in 4 drivers will be 65 years or older. Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury and death in older adults. Research on older African American drivers, to date, has only looked at driving cessation, and has not examined AD and cognition. The ability to identify who will be at most risk of driving decline and to predict when decline will occur would inform early driving safety intervention trials for older adults.  Our Specific Aims will test whether AD biomarker values interact with race and vascular risk factors (VRF) in predicting driving behavior over a one-year period: (1) We will determine, among cognitively normal older adults (N=60) whether there are racial differences in driving performance and behavior while adjusting for VRF, over a one-year period. (2) We will test whether factors known to be associated with AD predict driving performance and behavior by examining the three-factor interaction between race, AD biomarkers and VRF.  To test these Specific Aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in AD, neuroimaging biomarkers, CSF biomarkers, driving generally, naturalistic driving specifically, cognitive and brain aging, gerontology and longitudinal biostatistical methods. We will capitalize on our parent R01 by following a subset (N=30 African American, 30 Caucasian) of cognitively normal participants with and without preclinical AD. Each participant will take part in an annual, on-road driving evaluation to measure driving performance, as well as have their driving behavior captured daily, using a naturalistic method that collects data on date, time, speed, longitude and latitude each time a participant drives their vehicle.  We will test whether AD biomarker values and vascular risk factors interact with race in predicting driving performance and behavior. If the interaction between AD biomarkers and race is significant, this would stress the importance of obtaining biomarker measurements in research. These data may be valuable when seeking to explain the higher rate of AD development among African Americans, and in conducting clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury and death in older adults and by 2050, 1 in 4 drivers will be age 65 or older. Because African Americans are at twice the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to Caucasians, the goal of this pilot study is to examine whether driving behaviors differ by race cohort, and if so, whether these differences are linked to AD biomarkers.

"Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Impairment in the Southern Community Cohort Study PROJECT SUMMARY African Americans are 50% more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than white Americans. Understanding disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is an important public health issue, but few studies are designed to allow for a robust evaluation of ADRD-related health outcomes stratified by race and social risk factors. The Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) is a unique resource because it was launched to investigate health disparities related to cancer and other conditions in an understudied population. This longitudinal study recruited 86,000 adults age 40-79 between the years 2002-2009 in 12 Southern states. Two thirds of the study population is African American. About 9,300 SCCS participants are currently alive and age 75 and older. Another 2,300 SCCS participants have died after reaching age 75. Almost all SCCS participants over age 65 are enrolled in Medicare. Thus, claims-based measures of health care use and diagnostic information are almost universally available for these older SCCS members. Accordingly, we can identify ADRD and cognitive impairment through administrative data sources that are linked to the self-reported measures from the SCCS baseline survey and four follow-up surveys. This project will link additional administrative data sources on hospice and nursing home use to SCCS survey data. These new data sources and previously linked Medicare claims will be used to analyze how the incidence and prevalence of ADRD and cognitive impairment varies by race and social risk factors within the SCCS older population. We will also examine how hospital utilization and access to specialists varies by race and social risk factors for SCCS participants with ADRD or cognitive impairment. By examining these research questions, this study will provide a better understanding of health care disparities related to ADRD and lay the groundwork for future SCCS-based studies in this important area. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will use administrative data sources to investigate how prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment vary by race and other social risk factors within the Southern Community Cohort Study.

"Improving the measurement of everyday functional outcomes in diverse populations of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders Project Summary The aging population in the United States is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before. Health disparities have been well documented across diverse older adult populations, including evidence to suggest that there may be increased rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders among some groups. Researched aimed at understanding, preventing and ameliorating health disparities in AD is a major public health priority. However, to study and address these health disparities requires psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate assessment tools to sensitively measure early clinical signs associated with AD and to provide good outcome measures to track disease progression and response to treatment. The measurement properties of such assessment tools must be conceptually and psychometrically equivalent across diverse populations. With previous NIA funding (Farias, AG 0215111, AG 031252) we developed a novel questionnaire-based assessment tool (the Everyday Cognition scales (ECog) to measure very early limitations in everyday functions. Our work has shown that subtle changes in everyday functions, as measured by the ECog, can be used to identify older adults at increased risk for developing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, our most recent work has shown that the current version of the ECog is less sensitive to predicting disease progression in ethnic/racial minority subgroups (Latinos and African Americans) than it is in non-Latino Caucasians. Such findings provide clear rationale for the need to adapt and further refine this instrument to improve its utility as an early indicator of disease and as an outcome measure among diverse populations. The proposed study will utilize a multi-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to evaluate and improve the measurement equivalence of the ECog among diverse older adult populations. The aims of this study are twofold. In Aim 1 we will utilize existing data from the University of California, Davis Alzheimer Disease Center's multiethnic longitudinal cohort to quantitatively evaluate which items of the ECog display evidence of poor measurement equivalence across three racial/ethnic groups (African Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Caucasians) using sophisticated analytic methods. Informed by results of Aim 1, Aim 2 will employ well-established cognitive interviewing methods to further evaluate and identify the reasons why particular ECog items are problematic for specific racial/ethnic groups. For example, some items may not be readily understood as intended and/or some items may not be appropriate the cultural context and lifestyle of some groups. These items will be modified accordingly and a second wave of cognitive interviews will further evaluate item revisions. Completion of this study will provide the critical formative work to improve our ability to measure early changes in everyday function with comparable accuracy and precision across diverse older adult populations. Project Narrative While the aging population in the U.S. is becoming increasingly racially/ethnically diverse, health disparities remain problematic, including evidence that rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are disproportionately high among some groups. Researched aimed at understanding, preventing and ameliorating these health disparities in AD is a major public health priority. However, this requires accurate and culturally sensitive assessment tools to measure early clinical signs of AD and to provide good outcome measures to track disease progression and response to treatment. The proposed study will utilize a multi-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to improve the measurement of early everyday functional abilities associated with AD across diverse older adult populations.",Improving the measurement of everyday functional outcomes in diverse populations of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders,9544798,R03AG056563,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' California ', ' Cognition ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sound ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Comprehension ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' instrument ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Familiarity ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Property ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' AD detection ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' public health priorities ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racial minority ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,78500,0.056167583713963236
"Amyloid Burden among Mexican Americans PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this research is to address an important health disparity faced by Mexican Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), younger age of onset of AD and MCI. AD is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia and the 5th leading cause of death for those over 65 (8th leading cause of death for U.S. Hispanics). AD has an annual health care cost that is greater than that of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. While death rates from CVD and cancer have declined in recent decades, death rates have steadily increased for AD. The Mexican American elderly population is among the fastest growing segments of the population; however, little research on MCI and AD has been conducted among this underserved group. Here we will leverage our ongoing Health & Aging Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE; R56AG054073) study to conduct the first-ever test of the amyloid hypothesis within this underserved community. We will determine if amyloid burden is related to younger age of onset experienced by Mexican Americans. We will also study prodromal AD (i.e. normal cognition + amyloid positivity) among community-dwelling Mexican Americans. The current research team consists of leading experts in Mexican American cognitive aging and neuroimaging biomarkers of MCI/AD. The project leverages the ongoing NIH-funded HABLE infrastructure and data (including 3T MRIs) to address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Examine the prevalence and impact of amyloid burden among community-dwelling Mexican Americans suffering from MCI and AD; Aim 2: Examine prodromal Alzheimer's disease among community-dwelling Mexican Americans; and Aim 3. Examine plasma exosome amyloid among community-dwelling Mexican Americans. The current study is highly significant for several reasons: (1) this is the first-ever study of the amyloid hypothesis among Mexican Americans; (2) this study will examine how amyloid contributes to potentially different biological pathways for AD and MCI among Mexican Americans; (3) this study will generate a blood- based tool as the first-step in determining which Mexican Americans should undergo more costly amyloid PET scans for confirmatory diagnosis; and (4) this study will provide a tool for increased enrollment of Mexican Americans into clinical trials (treatment and prevention) directly from primary care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly growing number of patients suffering from Alzheimer's (AD), little work has been conducted on AD among Mexican Americans. Here we propose the first-ever examination of the amyloid hypothesis specifically among Mexican Americans. We will (1) examine the prevalence and impact of amyloid burden among community-dwelling Mexican Americans suffering from MCI and AD, (2) examine prodromal AD among community-dwelling Mexican Americans and (3) examine plasma exosome amyloid among community- dwelling Mexican Americans. We will determine if amyloid pathology is related to the health disparity of younger age of onset of MCI and AD among Mexican Americans. The relevance of this project is the examination of the key pathological mechanism thought to underlie AD, which will aid in the design of targeted therapies for this underserved ethnic population. This project will also create a novel method for screening Mexican Americans into amyloid trials beginning in primary care settings, where they receive the majority of care.",Amyloid Burden among

"Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Point-of-Care Technologies in Primary Care By 2050, the US population will consist of 88.5 million older adults aged ≥ 65 years; adults aged ≥85 years are the fastest growing age group. As the population ages, the number of persons with dementia will grow rapidly. Primary care clinicians will have to play an important role in delivering dementia care. In general, clinicians may fail to incorporate best practices into geriatric dementia diagnosis and treatment because of several biases. First, they may discount downstream harms of failure to plan or prepare for declining cognition. Second, they may fail to appreciate the aggregate benefit of initiating many small improvements in the patient's life. Third, clinicians may respond to real or perceived social norms (from patients, families or other clinicians) that set expectations to behave in specific ways. Fourth, clinicians may form habits that lead them to act in a similar way to past behavior even if evidence has changed. Lastly, decision fatigue, a known behavioral phenomenon at the end of clinical shifts, may also contribute to health disparities by surfacing subconscious (implicit) bias. Coordinated, point of care clinical decision support nudges, informed by behavioral economics and social psychology and delivered via electronic health records (EHRs), may help ensure persons with Alzheimer's disease receive guideline concordant care at primary care visits. Nudges could initiate early diagnosis and treatment through default orders, ensure nonpharmacological strategies to manage behavior are the first-line of treatment through social norms, deprescribe antipsychotics that are no longer useful through an EHR prompt asking clinicians to justify refills in a free text response and made visible in the patient's medical record as an “antipsychotic justification note”. Public commitments could be used to encourage communication with social services agencies. To have broad reach in future applications, these techniques require a partnership between government, academia and private sector stakeholders. Cooperation among federal funding agencies, clinical institutions, electronic health record vendors, pharmacy benefit managers, clinicians and patient advocacy groups, will allow new interventions to undergo careful evaluation in real-world settings and get implemented rapidly when effective. We propose a round table meeting among stakeholders to discuss how to best develop choice architectures in clinical environments to encourage guideline concordant dementia decisions in primary care for diverse elderly populations. The conference will result in a white paper that will be submitted for publication, identifying low cost behavioral science insights that can improve care for elderly persons at risk of dementia. Page 1 of 10 As the US population ages, the number of persons with dementia will grow rapidly, and primary care clinicians will have to play an important role in delivering dementia care. In general, clinicians may fail to incorporate best practices into geriatric dementia diagnosis and treatment because of competing biases. We propose convening a round table meeting of key stakeholders to discuss how best to develop choice architectures in clinical environments to encourage guideline concordant dementia decisions in primary care for diverse elderly populations.

"Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) aims to foster and enhance innovative research in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) with the long term goals to 1) advance ADRD-relevant social and behavioral science research in underserved and underrepresented communities while; 2) diversify the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging. This center will build on the existing deep infrastructure and research strengths in dementia and aging research at the University of Michigan (UM). The MCCFAD will emphasize research in three priority areas of: epidemiology, health economics, and culturally sensitive care. The rationale for these three areas is directly related to the current lack of a comprehensive understanding of the contextual complexities inherent in ADRD disparities, the need to enhance diversity in the professional research workforce addressing the brain and cognitive health of older adults, as well as dynamic changes in the demographic and multi-cultural composition of the U.S. population. The MCCFAD will promote diversifying the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging through collaborations with other NIA-sponsored Centers and programs and via connections with R1, R2 and R3 universities in Michigan. The Center will focus on the contexts in which ADRD is experienced. Knowledge concerning the contexts of ADRD is quite limited but has been shown to be critical for elucidating sociocultural, economic and behavioral contributors to and consequences of health disparities generally and ADRD disparities specifically. The Center's four Cores are: Administrative (AC), Research and Education (REC), Analytic (AnC), Community Liaison and Recruitment (CLRC) with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Advance ADRD-relevant disparities research in epidemiology, health economics, and culturally-sensitive care; Aim 2: Recruit and mentor 15 AD-RCMAR Scientists (RS) from the pilot-study investigator stage through professional publications and independent research applications and funding; Aim 3: Connect with African American, Arab American and Latino communities to broaden understanding of intra- and inter-cultural factors affecting participation in ADRD research. The Center profits from the groundbreaking, successful work of their extensive network of experienced mentors and experts. These resources, along with planned structure and activities will ensure that, upon receiving NIA designation as an AD-RCMAR, the MCCFAD will have a significant impact in diversifying the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging while enhancing research to better understand AD and related forms of dementia across various contexts. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) will focus on the social and behavioral dynamics in which Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are experienced.

"The Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research The Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health of the Johns Hopkins University are proposing a new Alzheimer's-related Resources Center for Minority Aging Research (AD- RCMAR) in response to RFA-AG-18-002. The aims of this application are to: (1) mentor early- stage investigators from underrepresented backgrounds in minority aging and health disparities research, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD), using a life course perspective encompassing biological, behavioral, and community factors contributing to cognitive impairment and dementia in older minority adults; (2) conduct epidemiological, preventive, and intervention research that addresses ADRD in later life within a multi-level framework that encompasses individuals, families, social networks, and communities; and 3) engage communities and health care providers – especially family caregivers, primary care practices, communities of faith, and community organizations – as our partners in recognizing dementia and developing interventions with the potential to prevent cognitive decline and reduce ADRD dementia risk and disparities in minority older adults. The Johns Hopkins AD- RCMAR consists of: (1) an Administrative Core whose function is to provide governance and an administrative structure, to support research, to foster interactions between Cores and other Centers, and to ensure RCMAR Scientists develop mentoring relationships across the affiliated departments, schools, the intramural program at NIA in Baltimore, and nationally; (2) a Research Education Component to foster diverse junior investigators and mid-career investigators transitioning into ADRD-relevant research through support for individual pilot projects, career mentoring, scholar-to-scholar interactions, and role modeling; (3) a Community- Liaison and Recruitment Core to ensure the relevance of the ADRD research and to increase knowledge of engagement of community members in the research enterprise with the creation of a Community Resource Institute as a venue for community-investigator interaction; and (4) an Analysis Core as a foundation for methodological and statistical mentoring, including education and mentoring in mixed-methods research. An Executive Committee includes community representatives and a Scientific Advisory Panel consists of distinguished investigators with relevant expertise in minority aging, disparities, and ADRD. A pilot project program supported by all Cores to facilitate the development of RCMAR Scientists includes three initial pilot projects focusing on recruitment of minority populations for ADRD research, early diagnoses of dementia, and intervention development related to ADRD-related driving disparities. The burden of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) falls disproportionately on the minority older population. Research on minority aging to understand racial/ethnic disparities in ADRD and to develop interventions and preventive strategies to reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk is urgently needed.

"Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias:  The Role of Blood Pressure Throughout Adulthood PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health burden and disproportionately affect African Americans. The mechanisms underlying this disparity are not well-understood, but elevated blood pressure could be key. Compared with whites, African Americans have higher prevalence, earlier age of onset, and greater severity of hypertension. Thus, older African Americans tend to have greater cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure throughout adulthood than older whites. No prior research, however, has quantified the contribution of hypertension to racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. There are significant methodological challenges to addressing this important question, including (1) measurement of cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure from the age of onset of hypertension through late adulthood, (2) measurement of cognitive function in diverse populations, and (3) possible survival bias, which is likely to differentially affect African Americans. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify the extent to which elevated blood pressure from mid- through late- adulthood mediates racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This project uses an innovative approach to examine this important question with existing data from two diverse Northern California cohorts: the University of California, Davis Aging Diversity Cohort and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Multiphasic Health Checkup cohort, which links mid-adulthood physical examinations with long-term medical record information. Analyses will address the three major methodologic challenges outlined above by examining cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure as measured at multiple points in adulthood, developing a novel neuroimaging-based brain health index in a diverse population, and quantifying the potential magnitude of survival bias using comprehensive midlife data to account for differential survival. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) measuring and modeling cognitive function in diverse populations, (2) clinical assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, (3) assessing brain health with neuroimaging, and (4) the biology of vascular disease relevant to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career focused on identifying modifiable determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in diverse populations. The methodological challenges addressed in this project are common to many areas of research on disparities in aging and cumulative exposure to risk factors throughout the lifecourse for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.

"The longitudinal effects of hypertension on cognitive aging in underrepresented minority adults with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY  Hypertension (HTN) affects approximately 33% of all adults living in the United States, particularly African Americans, who comprise over 42% of those with HTN [1-2]. In aging, HTN is associated with decreased cognitive functioning, and increased risk for clinically meaningful cognitive impairments and incident age-related neurodegenerative disorders [3-4]. HTN may confer risk for cognitive impairment via alterations in cerebral autoregulation (CA) caused by structural and functional changes to the cardiac and cerebral vasculature induced by HTN [5]. The impact of HTN on cognitive functioning in diverse, aging persons living with HIV (PLWH), however, is largely unknown, especially whether HTN differentially affects cognitive outcomes in HIV+ African Americans. Work in the cognitive aging literature suggests that HTN has a greater impact on cognitive functioning among African Americans than Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites [6]. One possible explanation for these differences may be due to disparities in HTN control that disproportionately affect African Americans [7-8].  As a result, we hypothesize that with aging, HTN as well as poor HTN control will exacerbate cognitive impairment in PLWH and that this effect will be greatest among African Americans. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal relationship between HTN and cognitive functioning in a diverse cohort of aging PLWH to examine the effects of HTN and HTN control on risk for cognitive impairments. These data will also be used to examine for racial disparities in the rates of cognitive impairment in this cohort. Finally given our limited understanding of the biological effects of HTN on brain functioning and cognition, the third aim of this study is to evaluate the longitudinal relationship between pulse pressure (PP), a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness, and cognition to indirectly explore the biological consequences of hypertension on the brain and CA [9]. Investigations regarding the potential impact of HTN, HTN control and PP on the brain and cognitive functioning are relevant given the increasing prevalence of HTN in aging PLWH, especially among HIV+ African Americans who currently comprise 50% of all HIV cases in the U.S. and experience greater hypertension burden [10]. Therefore, this project is both highly novel and significant as it will be the first to examine the longitudinal relationships between HTN, HTN control, PP and cognition in an exceptionally well- characterized and diverse sample with extensive longitudinal outcomes. Improved understanding of the role of HTN and HTN control on cognitive functioning in diverse, aging PLWH is critical to elucidate sources of health disparities frequently affecting underrepresented minority populations (URM). Thus, the results of this project also have important implications for public health, as this study will provide empirical evidence to inform and develop targeted intervention strategies that may mitigate cognitive dysfunction in URM. Project Narrative Hypertension and HIV disproportionately affect underrepresented minority populations, including African Americans, and these conditions may potentiate age-related cognitive decline through their effects on the central nervous system. This study will examine the relationship between hypertension and cognitive functioning in a diverse cohort of aging persons living with HIV and will also seek to determine whether hypertension and/or poor hypertension control differentially affect cognitive outcomes in HIV+ African Americans compared with Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites. Improved understanding of the role of hypertension in cognitive decline among underrepresented minority adults aging with HIV is critical to develop targeted intervention strategies that mitigate cognitive dysfunction. ",The longitudinal effects of hypertension on cognitive aging in underrepresented minority adults with HIV,9566844,F31MD011582,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+

"Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans Although African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss— with double the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to white Americans—we do not sufficiently understand the causes of this health disparity, nor how to best focus future interventional efforts to remediate this health crisis among older African Americans. Stress, sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyles, poor cardiovascular fitness, depressive symptoms, high body mass, and low education are all known risk factors for cognitive decline and AD; their widespread presence among African Americans, particularly in low socioeconomic communities, suggests that some or all of these may be key to the high rates of dementia and Alzheimer's among African Americans. However, little is known about the relative importance (and interactions) among these different risk factors for AD in African Americans. Additionally, there is a dearth of data on the neural changes that occur across the lifespan in older African Americans-- especially those at highest risk for AD-- and how these relate to behavioral and lifestyle risk factors for AD.  This revised R01 resubmission—including four months of pilot data from our R56 bridge award and retitled “Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans”—will address the aforementioned gaps in understanding minority health disparities in Alzheimer's disease. We will test 360 African Americans, ages 65-85, on a battery of neuropsychological, cognitive, health, fitness, genetic, and lifestyle assessments. Our sample includes 240 newly recruited participants as well as 120 legacy participants recruited during the current R56 grant. Half (180) will receive brain imaging using MRI, addressing the paucity of available neuroimaging data on older African Americans. Two aspects of our plans are especially innovative and significant to project success.  First, we address barriers to African-American research participation and retention through our ten-year history of partnership, cooperation, and trust with the African-American communities of Greater Newark through Rutgers University-Newark's African American Brain Health Initiative: A University-Community Partnership (www.brainhealth.rutgers.edu). Our long-term relationships with community-based organizations have been critical to our past successes and involve year-round programs for community outreach, education, and engagement that bolster our research recruitment and retention. Many of these efforts are funded through a five-year grant to the PI from the NJ Department of Health's Office of Minority and Multicultural Health.  Second, we address the need for evaluating and validating novel cognitive assessments that are sensitive to the earliest stages of prodromal Alzheimer's disease by having all participants complete the Rutgers Generalization Tasks, innovative cognitive assessments developed by the Co-I (Myers) and PI (Gluck). These tasks are derived from prior neurocomputational models of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus, brain regions disrupted in the earliest stages of prodromal AD. As these tasks are based on non-verbal animal conditioning paradigms, they may be especially valuable for tracking cognitive changes in our population, which is affected by low levels of education or verbal fluency. We hypothesize that deficits in generalization—the ability to apply previously learned rules to novel task demands and new stimuli—will correlate with, and longitudinally predict, cognitive decline and neural changes in prodromal AD. Aim #1. CROSS-SECTIONAL BEHAVIORAL ANALYSES: We will evaluate (1) how variations in health, physical fitness and activity are correlated with cognitive function, and (2) how the influence of these variables is mediated by education, social support, and genetics, in modulating the risk of cognitive decline and AD in elderly African Americans.!Predictions: Low levels of physical activity and cardiovascular fitness and high body mass, will be correlated with poorer performance on the Rutgers Generalization Tasks. Aim #2. NEURAL MECHANISM ANALYSES: Using multimodal MRI to capture brain structure, function, and  white matter integrity, we evaluate how the relationships in Aim #1 are mediated by neural mechanisms.  Predictions: Poorer generalization performance (and low levels of physical activity and fitness) will be associated with reduced hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortical thickness, intra-hippocampal and EC- hippocampal connectivity, and decreased FA and increased MD in the hippocampus and EC. Aim #3. LONGITUDINAL PREDICTIVE ANALYSES: To identify longitudinal aspects of the relationships  described in Aim #1 and Aim #2, along with predictors of future cognitive decline and progression to aMCI  and AD, we will test all participants at baseline and every two years thereafter (providing us data from three  time-points for the legacy R56 cohort, and two time-points for the newly recruited participants).  Predictions: Participants who progress to aMCI or AD will show early impairments on the generalization  tasks (correlated with neurodegeneration) prior to deficits in standardized memory assessments, as well as  being more likely to have a history of lower physical activity and poorer cardiovascular fitness. The proposed R01, building on our ongoing R56 data collection, will overcome current limitations to understanding the high rate of cognitive decline and AD in older African Americans, while providing further clinical and neuroimaging validation of innovative cognitive assessments, the Rutgers Generalization Tasks, which may prove useful for detecting and measuring cognitive changes in early prodromal AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE With this resubmission of R01 AG053961-01, now retitled “Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans,” the African-American Brain Health Initiative (AABHI) at Rutgers University-Newark seeks to investigate (1) the relative contributions of different modifiable health and lifestyle factors to age-related cognitive decline in African Americans, (2) the neural processes mediating these contributions, and, (3) identify early predictors of cognitive decline and conversion to aMCI and AD, and understand how the health and lifestyle behaviors influence risk for subsequent cognitive decline. Although African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss—with double the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to white Americans—we do not sufficiently understand the causes of this health disparity, nor how to best focus future interventional efforts to remediate this health crisis among older African Americans.

"Dementia and Physical Disablement Processes among Aging Latinos Dementia and Physical Disablement Processes among Aging Latinos Project Summary The Latino population is rapidly aging and by 2050 will represent over 20% of the older adult population in the U.S. At the same time, the burden of dementia in the older Latino population is expected to increase from around 200,000 cases in 2000 to as many as 1.3 million cases in 2050, with many more suffering from milder degrees of cognitive impairment. A further stress on the Latino and specifically Mexican-origin population is high poverty rates. Close to 27% of older Mexican Americans in the U.S. live below the poverty line which is over double the rate for older adults in general (Administration for Community Living, 2014). Disparities in dementia raise serious public health concerns; yet, there have been surprisingly few longitudinal studies on the role of dementia and cognitive impairment for physical disablement processes in the Mexican-origin population. Understanding how dementia shapes physical disablement pathways and identifying factors that slow down or speed up disablement will lead to a better understanding at which point geriatric public health intervention is most needed. We propose to employ a longitudinal cohort study of 3,050 older Mexican-origin individuals the 1993/94-2016/17 Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (H-EPESE). First, we will use nine waves of survey data to 1) describe the long-term patterns of dementia and cognitive impairment for a prospective cohort of older Mexican Americans. Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) is used for this part of the analysis. Then, we will 2) estimate the role of dementia and cognitive impairment for changes in physical disablement processes over twenty years of study data. Finally, we will 3) assess differences in dementia-related physical disablement within the group by gender, socioeconomic status, and sociocultural factors. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of long-term health change for Mexican Americans in late life and an estimation of how many Mexican Americans with dementia need support in late life. Ultimately, our objective is to develop and evaluate a new empirical model to describe long-term patterns of dementia for physical disablement processes that can be replicated with other segments of the aging population to determine the extent of need for specialized long-term support services. Project Narrative Currently, little is known about the nature of dementia-specific physical disablement processes for the rapidly growing and rapidly aging Mexican American population. We propose to utilize data from a cohort study of Mexican Americans and develop an innovative research design to examine heterogeneity in physical disablement processes and the role of dementia as these disablement processes unfold. The proposed study will advance knowledge of dementia-related physical disablement in the aging Latino population in the U.S. and highlight segments of this population that would greatly benefit from effective policy and program initiatives.",Dementia and Physical Disablement Processes among Aging Latinos,9508076,R03AG059107,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Family ', ' Gills ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Gender ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Policies ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Physical shape ', ' morphological signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' community living ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' high risk ', ' cognitive disability ', ' public health intervention ', ' cognitive ability ', ' dementia care ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' care costs ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R03,2018,90991,0.06354623014218413
"Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this application, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a presidentially initiated effort to understand the genetics of AD in hopes of developing new targets for therapies. Currently lacking in these efforts, however, is the inclusion of African American (AA) populations and the generalization of research findings to AA communities. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we propose a set of experiments that will complement the activities in the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases while addressing the issue of health disparities in AA AD research.",Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans,9514798,U01AG052410,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Community Networks ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' exhaustion ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' SNP chip ', ' SNP array ', ' admixture mapping ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,1255692,0.04163752629583948
"Risk factors for MCI and Dementia in a Diverse Senior Cohort ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Risk factors for MCI and dementia in a diverse senior cohort. Community-based research on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia includes relatively few longitudinal studies that include low-income minority seniors. PAR 15-356 specifically welcomes projects that propose augmenting existing longitudinal cohort studies, enhancing the power of multi- ethnic cohort studies, and exploring trends in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose to use intensive community-based outreach to recruit 800 seniors from a low-SES group of boroughs whose population is 60% African American (AA). These boroughs, comprising the 15104 ZIP code, are within the study area of MYHAT (R01AG023651), an ongoing population- based cohort study of cognitive impairment and dementia in 2000+ randomly selected seniors in southwestern PA. By using the MYHAT assessment protocol in the proposed new 15104 volunteer cohort, we will collect identical data and cost-effectively leverage the MYHAT data by pooling the two cohorts for analysis. Using appropriate sampling weights to adjust our estimates for non-random sample selection of the 15104 cohort, we will examine risk and resilience factors within the pooled cohort. We will identify factors associated with MCI at baseline, and, through annual follow-up assessments, identify risk factors for subsequent cognitive decline and dementia. Particularly, but not exclusively, we will focus on risk factors common among AA seniors: low education, poor educational quality, low health literacy, APOE*4 genotype, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. We will then determine whether race modifies the relationship between risk factors and adverse cognitive outcomes. Enhancing the participation of minority seniors will allow us to take a critical first step towards addressing the challenges of investigating, and eventually addressing, cognitive health disparities in the population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Between 2006 and 2008, we assembled a community-based cohort of over 2,000 adults, aged  65+ years, by randomly selecting individuals from the Voter Registration lists for a group  of small towns municipalities in a Rust Belt area of southwestern Pennsylvania . The study  is called the Monongahela- Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT). We now propose to use intensive community outreach within 3 towns in the same area, with  enthusiastic support from the town Mayors, to recruit a sample of 800 volunteers who are  60% African Americans. We will work with community leaders to inform seniors in these  towns about the MYHAT study and encourage their participation. Using appropriate  statistical weighting methods, we will combine the new sample with the MYHAT sample. The knowledge generated will inform clinical and public health strategies for prevention of  cognitive decline and dementia in older minority adults, and potentially influence health  policy and planning.",Risk factors for MCI and Dementia in a Diverse Senior Cohort,9492981,R01AG058549,"['Abbreviations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' plan health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Smoking ', ' Stable Populations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' APOE\xa0e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Out-Migrations ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' spelling ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Municipalities ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Glossary ', ' outreach ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' systematic review ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' volunteer ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' healthy aging ', ' population based ', ' follow up assessment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' Minority Participation ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,759088,0.13068898525046677
"Offpsring Study of Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease The overall aim of this study is to identify underlying biological and sociocultural mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive function among a middle-aged cohort of 3,000 offspring whose parents do and do not have Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Studies of non-Hispanic Whites have shown that children of people with AD are at increased risk of developing the disease, and that factors such as parental age at onset and APOE allele status may modify risk associated with a family history of AD. Rates of AD are two to three times higher among Hispanic and African American than among non-Hispanic White elders and the prevalence of many cardiovascular and demographic risk factors for AD is higher among ethnic minorities than among non- Hispanic Whites. However, potential mediators and modifiers of family risk have not been well examined among racial and ethnic minorities, nor has much prior work been conducted among families where data from detailed clinical and biomarker examinations on parents were available from in-person examinations. Since pathology begins to manifest in the brain in the fifth and sixth decades of life, we propose that mechanisms for racial/ethnic disparities can be more clearly revealed in middle age and thus help to clarify the determinants and pathways of ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment with aging and potential critical periods for intervention. Our overarching hypothesis is that the primary mode of transmission of parental AD risk among racial/ethnic minorities is via vascular and social pathways, while the primary transmission of parental AD risk among Whites is via genetic pathways that affect amyloid deposition in the brain. Specifically, the project will 1) determine which biological mediators of parental risk of AD on offspring cognition differ most across race/ethnicity, 2) determine which educational, economic, and social moderators of parental risk of AD on offspring cognition differ most across race/ethnicity, and 3) use directly measured parental risk factor data to refine our understanding of mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in AD. The prevalence of AD and the societal and economic burden associated with AD treatment and care is expected to rise as baby boomers enter old age. This is particularly true of African Americans and Hispanics who are at higher risk for AD than similarly aged non-Hispanic Whites. Offspring of elders with AD are at increased risk of developing the disease. It is therefore critical to identify factors that may increase or lower risk of AD, and may reduce disparities in AD, particularly in the 4th and 5th decades of life when pathology begins to manifest in the brain and when intervention may delay or prevent onset.",Offpsring Study of Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease,9462488,RF1AG054070,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', '

"A Culturally-Relevant Approach to Reducing Dementia Caregiver Stress in an Underserved Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans currently are the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S., thus, the number of Asian Americans with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers will also increase. Surprisingly, very little intervention work has focused on addressing caregiver needs in this population. Specifically, a large gap exists in the development of interventions to reduce caregiver stress and little is known about how cultural diversity impacts caregiver stress and intervention outcomes. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will give Dr. Meyer the skills, training, and mentoring necessary to conduct community-engaged interventions to reduce the burden of AD in culturally diverse family caregivers. The proposed mentored research activities for this K01 award are to refine and pilot test a theoretically-informed, culturally-relevant, community-based intervention informed by sociocultural stress and coping and social contextual models to reduce distress and enhance well-being in Vietnamese American dementia caregivers. By focusing on this large and underserved population, this K01 application is consistent with NIA Research Goal E: Improve our ability to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults. It als responds to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) to involve more racially/ethnically diverse older adults in research and to develop effective services to support ethnically diverse families. This application includes experiential and research activities in three critical areas fo Dr. Meyer's career development: (1) knowledge of AD and associated dementias (e.g., risk factors, assessment and diagnosis, course) and cognitive impairment and how they affect families, (2) methodological skills and cultural knowledge to conduct community-engaged intervention research, including formal training in aspects of community-based participatory research (e.g. mixed methods) and enhanced knowledge of Vietnamese culture and language, and (3) theoretical and methodological skills necessary to design, implement, and analyze scientifically rigorous interventions for culturally diverse populations (e.g., design issues, longitudinal data analysis). Mentored research training will occur in the context of a focused research project with two aims: (1) Refine and manualize a culturally- informed intervention to reduce distress and enhance well-being in Vietnamese dementia caregivers, and (2) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Completion of the proposed research and career development activities will generate data to inform the development of an R34 or R21 application and provide Dr. Meyer with the experience necessary to transition from observational/ descriptive to community-based intervention work. Dr. Meyer will leverage existing resources and expertise at three NIH-funded centers at UC Davis: the Alzheimer's disease Center, the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, and the Clinical and Translational Science Center. These resources, along with the mentoring team's strong, collaborative relationships with local community-based organizations will provide an enriched environment that will help Dr. Meyer to be a successful and independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the number of Asian Americans rapidly grows, so too will the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers. Caregivers of persons with AD suffer a substantial burden emotionally, physically, and financially, and this may be especially true for immigrant and underserved Asians. The development of psychosocial interventions that address the diversity and complexity of caregiver distress in culturally diverse populations is a critical public health challenge.",A

"Social convoys, cognitive reserve, and resilience across the lifespan PROJECT SUMMARY Minority populations of all ages face varying degrees of stigma and minority stress. Little is known about the impact of stress associated with specific minority identity statuses on aging and on the risk for incident Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Limited research to date indicates that social support appears to protect against the negative impact of stress on health. Few studies, however, have assessed the social support networks of minority populations in detail. The proposed study aims to fill this gap and determine what social support characteristics are associated with successful cognitive and emotional aging, the development of cognitive reserve and resilience, and reduced risk of incident MCI and AD. The investigation will be guided by the Convoy Model of Social Support (Antonucci et al., 1987, 2013). According to this model, social relationships or convoys are shaped over time and vary in their closeness, quality (e.g., positive, negative), function (e.g., aid, affect, affirmation, exchanges), and structure (e.g., size, composition, contact frequency, geographic proximity). Convoys are influenced by personal (age, gender) and situational (role demands, norms, values) characteristics that affect health. The proposed study will take a lifespan approach because cognitive reserve and resilience are shaped by experiences throughout life. Parallel to an ongoing, general population cohort, we propose to recruit a sample of minority adults stratified by age: young adulthood (25-¬34, n = 50), adulthood (35-¬44; n = 50), midlife (45-¬54, n = 50), older adulthood (55-¬64, n = 75), and later life (65 and above; n = 75). Recruiting participants across the lifespan will allow us to examine differences in stigma, social support and other resources, cognitive reserve and resilience between different generations. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: (1) Describe in detail the social support networks of minority (n = 300) and majority (n = 300) adults, and examine within-¬ and between-¬group differences in social support based on age, sex, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES); (2) Assess the relationship between stress related to gender, sexual orientation, racial/ethnic and age identity, and mental health and cognitive functioning; (3) Examine the role of social support, resources and wellbeing, in the development of cognitive reserve and resilience (i.e., how social support, resources and wellbeing may moderate the effects of aging and stigma on mental health and cognitive functioning);; and (4) Using existing data, explore differences between minority and majority participants in brain features and their relation to stress, social support, cognitive functioning and risk for incident MCI and AD. Findings will advance our understanding of the social support networks of minority and majority adults across the lifespan;; characterize the protective role of social support; and inform the development of future, tailored interventions to promote successful aging and reduce risk for incident MCI and AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities among minority populations have, at least in part, been attributed to stigma and minority stress, while social support has been found to be protective. This study will identify what characteristics of social support are protective for whom in the prevention of cognitive decline and the promotion of resilience among minority and majority populations. Findings will inform future, tailored interventions to facilitate successful aging and reduce risk for incident Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).","Social convoys, cognitive reserve, and resilience across the lifespan",9787670,R56AG059643,"['Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Assisted Reproductive Technology ', ' Assisted Reproduction Technology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' gender minority ', ' cognitive development ', ' cisgender ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cognition ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' New York City ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Competence ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' disability ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' cognitive function ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2018,794426,0.05355397212193117

The current proposal further develops this objective by linking this tested cognitive marker to AD Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) biomarkers and imaging. In a cohort of ~120 study participants (>50% with Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI, who are AA) we propose 1) to assess the levels of AD CSF biomarkers as well as hippocampal thickness per MRI in order to determine the Aβ1-42 (A), p-tau (T) and extent of neurodegeneration (N) profile, the updated research diagnostic criteria for AD; and 2) Determine if AD CSF biomarkers are associated with impaired executive function. Our overall objective is to contribute A,T,N profile data for AA with MCI as there is a dearth of such data in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) even though the research definition of AD is changing significantly. The Specific Aims to be completed are the following: 1. Compare levels of Aβ1-42 (A), p-tau (T), and hippocampal volumes (N) in AA and White participants to establish a body of data on CSF correlates of A, T and N with race. Our working hypothesis is that for the same level of cognitive performance, we will observe higher CSF Aβ1-42 (A), (reflecting lower brain amyloidosis), lower p-tau, and larger hippocampal volumes for AA study participants based on prior observations that vascular factors (hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes) may be greater contributors to cognitive impairment in AA relative to Whites. 2. Determine the differential association between AD CSF biomarkers and various cognitive domains by race. Our working hypothesis is that in AA we will observe a stronger association between AD CSF biomarkers (A and/or T) and executive function (as assessed by the CLOX and Flanker task) than in Whites. The funding of this project will serve to leverage pre-collected CSF biospecimen data for the purpose of applying the new NIA- Alzheimer's Association updated research framework to contribute data for a minimum of 58 AA with MCI to the larger community of AD research cohorts. This proposal comprises data that will be obtained via a cross-sectional study design. CSF from all willing participants not meeting exclusion criteria in the parent study will be analyzed via quantitative analysis for Aβ1-42, t-Tau, and p-Tau181p. Our primary outcome is the AT(N) biomarker profile and category for at least 58 AA with MCI and 57 without MCI. Additionally completing the analysis of AD CSF biomarkers with executive impairment may serve to link a more sensitive cognitive performance marker in AA to the updated NIA-Alzheimer's Association research framework of AD, yielding a more robust assessment for AA who are often either undiagnosed or diagnosed in more advanced stages of disease. Project Narrative Completion of the projects outlined will serve to address critical disparity in knowledge of a biologic description of Alzheimer's disease in African Americans. The main objective is to characterize the Aβ1-42 (A), phosphorylated tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) profiles for at least 58 African Americans with MCI, a stage of cognitive impairment often preceding the development of Alzheimer's disease. An additional objective will be to test whether executive function impairment (thought to be a more appropriate cognitive marker in African Americans due to its vulnerability to hypertension effects) is associated with AD CSF biomarkers and characteristic imaging.","In search of an Ethno-culturally Appropriate Strategy for the Early identification of Cognitive Impairment in African Americans, EASE

"Racial Differences in Arterial Stiffness and Cognitive Function. Summary It has been stated that “a person is only as old as his/her arteries” (Sir William Osler ~ 1898). With aging, large central arteries such as the aorta and carotid arteries lose their elasticity while small peripheral arteries lose their ability to dilate and constrict in response to perturbations. Vascular dysfunction may affect blood flow delivery to the brain, directly impacting cognitive performance. African Americans have premature vascular aging, which may contribute to premature cognitive aging. In our first aim, we will examine racial differences in novel measures of arterial stiffness, endothelial function, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function. In our second aim, we will explore dynamic changes in aforementioned parameters during a cognitive challenge. Results from this study may suggest a crucial vascular component to racial differences in cognitive performance. Early intervention to target specific aspects of premature vascular aging in AAs as identified in this study may lead to better preservation of cognitive function with advancing age and help abrogate racial disparities in hypertensive cerebrovascular damage and cognitive impairment in later life. NARRATIVE Reduced artery elasticity, as naturally occurs with aging, has a negative effect on blood flow to the brain. This study will examine if premature artery aging in African Americans disproportionally affects brain blood flow during cognitive engagement offering insight into racial differences in cognitive decline with aging.",Racial Differences in Arterial Stiffness and Cognitive Function.,9572417,R03MD011306,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Aorta ', ' Arteries ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' brachial artery ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Buffers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elasticity ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' indexing ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Oxygen ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' pressure ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Organ ', ' reactive hyperemia ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Premature Aging ', ' Premature aging syndrome ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Metabolic ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Life ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' artery stiffness ', ' artery stiffening ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' response ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Central Artery ', ' Cognitive ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' computerized ', ' diet and exercise ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' cognitive task ', ' neuro-vascular coupling ', ' neurovascular coupling ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' neurovascular ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIMHD,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,75000,0.0020700989625448097
"The UCSF Brain Health Assessment for the Detection of Cognitive Impairment Among Diverse Populations in Primary Care Efficient and user-friendly neurocognitive screens are needed that are sensitive to the variety of neurocognitive disorder presentations to primary care. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment was developed to efficiently measure the cognitive domains that can be affected in the earliest stages of neurocognitive decline, including memory, executive functions / speed, visuospatial skills, language, behavior, and function. Four subtests and an optional informant survey are administered via an appealing tablet interface and with automated scoring and provider feedback. Preliminary validation studies indicate excellent combined sensitivity and specificity to cognitive impairment among English-speaking older adults with moderate to high levels of education. The primary goals of the proposed work are to optimize and validate the BHA for older adults who are diverse in terms of education and language spoken, to perform cross-validation studies of other paradigms funded by this award, and to evaluate and address barriers to detecting cognitive impairment in primary care. Education and English as a second language each impact cognitive test performance and are barriers to accurate detection of cognitive impairment. This project will address these health disparities by including persons with diverse levels of education and persons whose primary language is Spanish, Mandarin, or Cantonese in both validation and implementation studies. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed English-speaking older adults with low, moderate, or high education. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed Spanish-, Cantonese-, or Mandarin-speaking older adults. In Aim 3, we will identify and address implementation challenges in primary care practices that serve patients diverse in terms of education and language spoken. If successful, this project will lead to increased detection of cognitive impairment in everyday community settings, which is essential to enable differential diagnosis and to improve medical management for people with cognitive impairment, including dementia, in the United States. Early detection of neurocognitive disorders is highly beneficial for patients and families, yet cognitive impairment and dementia are frequently under-recognized. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment is designed to rapidly detect cognitive impairment in primary care and other everyday clinical settings. The proposed research will establish the feasibility of this assessment to increase cognitive impairment detection rates among patients with different levels of education and who speak English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin.",The UCSF Brain Health Assessment for the Detection of Cognitive Impairment Among Diverse Populations in Primary Care,9573307,UG3NS105557,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Data Collection ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Paste substance ', ' Pastes ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Educational Materials ', ' International ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' visual spatial ', ' Visuospatial ', ' user-friendly ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' stability testing ', ' Secure ', ' tablet device ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' neurocognitive disorder ', ' brain health ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' health assessment ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UG3,2018,1522043,0.06461973498189376
"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Online Small-Group Self-Management Workshop for Rural Caregivers of Individuals with Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT SUMMARY  Among 13 million informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias, an estimated 1.4 million live in rural areas of the US. These caregivers are a vulnerable group due to their physical isolation and well-documented rural disparities in health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is an pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers so that they can sustain their own well-being and effective caregiving within the home environments of their loved ones.  Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home environment and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related forms of dementia. In our evaluations of the program in non-randomized studies, caregivers experienced significant improvements in stress, depression symptoms, and self-efficacy and partners experienced improved well-being.  Building on these encouraging preliminary findings, we now propose to conduct a hybrid effectiveness- implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: 320 in the intervention (workshop) group and 320 in the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited through 19 community organizations (serving rural communities in 17 states). Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depression symptoms. We hypothesize that stress scores and depression symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. We will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. We will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.  If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 13 million informal, mostly unpaid caregivers (“caregivers”) provide critical support to US adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, enabling them the remain in their homes and communities. But many dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to these responsibilities, including caregivers who live in rural settings where resources and support may be difficult to access. The proposed project will determine whether a 6-week online self-management and skills-building workshop called Building Better Caregivers improves the well-being of isolated dementia caregivers who live in rural settings and also whether the workshop has the potential to be widely disseminated to such caregivers throughout rural America.",Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Online Small-Group Self-Management Workshop for Rural Caregivers of Individuals with Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias,9597161,R01AG057855,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Program Accessibility ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Friends ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family member ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' implementation trial ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' rural disparities ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' loved ones ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' attentional control ', ' care receiver ', ' care recipients ', ' Informal care giver ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia caregiving ', ' stress symptom ', ' rural America ', ' rural setting ', ' recruit ', ' self-management program ', ' clinical implementation ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,765434,0.06764121251806139
"Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Due to Ambulance Diversion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2007, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) characterized ambulance diversion (AD), the practice by which Emergency Departments (EDs) are temporarily closed, as ""antithetical to quality medical care"" and called for its ""elimination"". Nevertheless, A persists, with 45% of EDs and 70% of urban EDs reporting AD in the last published survey in 2003. AD has been associated with higher mortality, delayed treatment, and other adverse outcomes. Not examined hitherto, AD has the potential to exacerbate disparities by race/ethnicity and income. AD may also increase healthcare costs. However, the current literature on the impact of AD is based on data from convenience sampling and is limited by a dearth of experimental evidence. On 1/1/2009, Massachusetts became the first, and to date only, state to ban AD. Treating the state-imposed ban as a natural experiment, we propose to estimate the causal impact of AD on access, outcomes, and cost, focusing on the potentially differential effects by race/ethnicity and income.  To better understand ambulance use and AD within the milieu of overall patient care, we will develop a national longitudinal database of ambulance use based on Medicare administrative data. Using longitudinal patient records, this data will be better suited to examine the determinants of ambulance use, outcomes, and the impact of AD across diverse patients.  We will focus on older adults with a chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary condition. We will identify a national cohort of a stratified random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 or older (N=1,000,000), with an oversample from Massachusetts, and obtain data on all healthcare utilization, including ambulance and ED visits, from 2006-2012. Given the primacy of residential location in examining ambulance and ED use, this sample will be stratified by race/ethnicity and residence zip code to enable comparison of diverse patients from the same area. For the subset of Boston residents (Boston cohort) we will merge data from the Boston Emergency Medical Services (EMS) from 2006-2012 for EMS-specific outcome measures. Our specific aims are to evaluate: (1) incidence of ambulance use and reliance, (2) differences by race/ethnicity and income in ambulance transport outcomes, and (3) impact of Massachusetts AD ban on outcomes of ambulance transport and other ED patients not transported by ambulance.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has highlighted the ""limited"" research and knowledge base of EMS practices. Using novel data with national scope, this study will make significant contributions to this evidence base and inform public policy on AD regarding not only its impact on clinical outcomes, but also, its impact on disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine (IOM) characterized ambulance diversion (AD), the practice by which Emergency Departments (EDs) are temporarily closed, as ""antithetical to quality medical care"" and called for its ""elimination"". Massachusetts is the only state to ban AD, effective 1/1/2009. Using a novel data of ambulance use developed from administrative data from Medicare and Boston Emergency Medical Services, this study will use quasi-experimental methods to estimate the causal impact of AD on ambulance travel, type of destination ED, patient mortality, length of stay, and costs.",Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Due to Ambulance Diversion,9405625,R01HL127212,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Ambulances ', ' Boston ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cost Measures ', ' cost measurement ', ' Cost metrics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Destinations ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' beneficiary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Natural experiment ', ' safety net ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' longitudinal database ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Patient risk ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,479034,0.11391560631937965
"Nonlinear Models of Cognition Preceding AD and non-AD in a Biracial Population Sample This proposal aims to conduct secondary analyses of existing data to examine nonlinear cognitive decline in standardized global summary of cognition assessed using executive functioning, episodic memory, and overall global cognition and orientation within the context of a large population-based study of older adults: Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). More specifically, the four objectives of this proposal are: 1) Examine Nonlinear Cognitive Decline in Older Blacks and Whites Using Change Point Models in a Random Sample of 2,948 Participants with AD and non-AD Diagnosis; 2) investigate the Role of Demographic, Social, Lifestyle, Cardiovascular, and Genetic Risk Factors on Nonlinear Cognitive Decline in Older Blacks and Whites with AD and non-AD Diagnosis; 3) Identify the Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Cognitive Decline Using Latent Class Growth Curve Models Using a Population Sample of 7,757 Blacks and Whites with Multiple Cognitive Assessments; 4) Understand the Role of Demographic, Social, Lifestyle, Cardiovascular, and Genetic Risk Factors on Latent Class Memberships to Explain Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Cognitive Decline. Understanding the rate of cognitive decline in older blacks and whites has a topic of considerable interest. However, most research has focused on linear trajectories in whites with mixed findings among blacks. Nonlinear cognitive decline based on change points are nonexistent in blacks and the proposed work can increase our understanding of preclinical phase of AD and non-AD. Description: This proposal aims to conduct a secondary data analysis to study the nonlinear changes in cognitive function using change point models for decline preceding AD and non-AD and the covariate effects of five sets of risk factors, namely, demographic, social, lifestyle, cardiovascular, and genetic on nonlinear cognitive decline. The study also proposed the use of latent class growth curve models to examine the heterogeneity in population- level cognition and nonlinear cognitive decline in a population-based longitudinal study of older adults.

"Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive reserve refers to the ability to buffer against brain pathology, including types commonly found post mortem in the brains of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). I hypothesize that reserve is a key reason why some older adults have normal cognitive function despite the presence of neuropathology. Recently, researchers have begun to empirically investigate reserve as the discrepancy between neuropathology and brain function, as measured with cognitive tests. Studies have found a relationship between a disadvantaged early life environment and later life clinical dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. However, it is not known if an advantaged early life is related to greater later life reserve or lower levels of neuropathology itself. As brain development is particularly accelerated through age 5 years, early life could be a sensitive period for cognitive reserve. I propose to use four unique datasets that contain information on early life social environment, later life cognitive tests, and autopsy-based neuropathology measures from geographically diverse study populations: the Adult Changes in Thought Study, the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, the Religious Orders Study, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. I test the hypotheses that an advantaged early life environment, independently of and synergistically with adult social advantage, is related to greater later life cognitive reserve, even in the presence of significant neuropathology. I will be able to test also whether early life environment is related to actual levels of cognition and neuropathology. My background in demography and epidemiology, including 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow and 5 years as a junior faculty member, prepares me to lead these projects, under the guidance of a team that reflects the leadership of the proposed studies, local experts in neuropathology and epidemiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, a local expert in the analysis of cognitive measures, and a leading expert in the integration of social and life course epidemiology. The proposed training and research experiences in this project will be integral in building a foundation in the analysis of cognitive outcomes and resilience to dementia, and enhancing the experience of my existing skills in life course and aging epidemiology that will allow me to lead future projects at the intersection of these fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project identifies whether an advantaged early social environment increases one's later life cognitive reserve, that is, the ability to buffer from pathology. I measure an advantaged early social environment primarily through early life family socioeconomic position and height and also test to what extent an advantaged adult social environment explains this relationship, versus the link from early life to later life cognitive reserve.","Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve",9506630,K01AG050723,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Asia ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Baltimore ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Buffers ', ' Clergy ', ' Cognition ', ' Demography ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Illinois ', ' Japanese American ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' Memory ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' nutritional care ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' Head circumference ', ' news ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Height ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social inequality ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' early life exposure ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' study population ', ' Lifecourse epidemiology ', ' Life course epidemiology ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2018,118944,0.11199385342020583
"Identifying Scalable and Culturally Relevant Strategies for Recruitment of African Americans with Cognitive Impairment into Dementia Research ABSTRACT African Americans are twice as likely to have Alzheimer’s disease than Whites, yet they are underrepresented in dementia research. The low rate of participation among African Americans hinders the understanding of the mechanisms of dementia in this population, further widening health disparities. To date, partnerships with faith- based organizations are the most common strategy used to recruit African Americans into dementia research. However, estimates suggest that only half of African Americans regularly attend religious services, which limits the effectiveness of this strategy. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop additional culturally relevant and scalable strategies for recruiting African Americans with cognitive impairment into dementia research. To develop such strategies, we will leverage the expertise of the research team in recruiting older adults who are underrepresented in research studies. Because older adults with cognitive impairment are likely to be wary of strangers, identifying trusted community-based organizations (CBOs) who are also culturally relevant is critical. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine how CBOs with national reach could be used as a culturally relevant and scalable approach to facilitate recruitment of African Americans with cognitive impairment. In order to identify these partnerships, we will use qualitative methods of analysis. We will interview African Americans with cognitive impairment, caregivers, and administrators of selected CBOs with national reach (total n=100). Interviews and focus groups will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis. We will include two sites with whom we have established partnerships and have a high representation (≥ 25%) of African Americans: Oakland, CA and Detroit, MI. Interviews and focus groups will occur at two time points: Timepoint 1 will be used to collect initial data. We will return to the same participants in Timepoint 2 to obtain feedback on specific guidelines to help standardize recruitment strategies for African Americans with cognitive impairment nationwide. The proposed research has three specific aims: (1) to identify barriers and facilitators to recruit African Americans with cognitive impairment into research using CBOs with national reach; (2) to examine factors related to trust and cultural relevance of CBOs to facilitate recruitment, and; (3) to examine barriers and facilitators of developing partnerships with CBOs with national reach to facilitate recruitment. The proposed project will address the need to increase the participation of African Americans with cognitive impairment into research. The methods developed as part of this project can be applied to future studies recruiting African Americans with cognitive impairment. These methods can also be used to identify strategies and guidelines to recruit other ethnic/racial minorities with cognitive impairment as well as other vulnerable groups into research. Findings of this study will create the foundation for a larger R01 study to finalize and test the effectiveness of national guidelines for standardized strategies with selected CBOs to recruit African Americans with cognitive impairment into dementia research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Increasing the number of African Americans with cognitive impairment participating into research studies will provide the knowledge to better understand the mechanisms of dementia in African Americans. This knowledge is critical because African Americans are twice as likely to have Alzheimer’s disease than Whites. 1",Identifying Scalable and Culturally Relevant Strategies for Recruitment of African Americans with Cognitive Impairment into Dementia Research,9584397,R03AG060354,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Feedback ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Meals on Wheels ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Social Workers ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Administrator ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Trust ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' research study ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Collection ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' standardize guidelines ', ' racial minority ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2018,80000,0.13419836775928762
"Midlife cognitive aging in Hispanic/Latinos:  Predictors and mechanisms of decline PROJECT SUMMARY Individuals from Hispanic/Latino backgrounds have a 50% increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to non-Hispanic white individuals. With the changing demographic trends in the United States, the prevalence of AD in the Hispanic/Latino population is expected to increase nine fold over the next 50 years. In addition to the patient, the burden of AD takes a significant toll on the families of loved ones with dementia, their communities, and the healthcare system. The difference in prevalence of AD is rooted in social disparities rather than differences in genetic vulnerability between Hispanic/Latino and white populations. It is critical to identify the specific social determinants in Hispanic/Latino populations that can be leveraged to develop culturally informed interventions that aim to maintain cognitive health and slow or prevent the progression toward mild cognitive impairment and clinical dementia. Midlife is a particularly important, yet understudied, period of the lifespan for cognitive aging. Prevention and intervention efforts are likely to be more effective if started before significant neuropathology accumulates in the brain. The objective of this proposal is to identify midlife factors and associated processes that contribute to health disparities in cognitive decline and risk of dementia. We will leverage an existing longitudinal study of midlife adults – the California Families Project – to couple more than 10 years of repeated assessments across middle adulthood with new data collection on the risk/protective factors and cognitive outcomes. This project will test socioeconomic (e.g., education, financial hardship), personality (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness), social (e.g., discrimination, social support), and acculturation (e.g., cultural values, acculturative stress) risk/protective factors for cognitive functioning in midlife Hispanic/Latino adults and the behavioral (e.g., physical inactivity, smoking), psychosocial (e.g., depressive symptoms, delay discounting), and physiological (e.g., inflammation, cellular biomarkers) mechanisms that explain these associations. This work will lead to new knowledge on midlife predictors of cognition and risk of AD, identify social determinants and pathways that create and sustain health disparities for Hispanic/Latino populations, and point to new prevention and intervention targets for promoting healthy cognitive aging in midlife and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults of Latino origin have a 50% increased risk of the disease compared to non-Latino white adults, a difference due to social determinants rather than differences in genetic vulnerability. Identifying modifiable risk/protective factors in this population and the processes through which these factors contribute to cognitive decline and dementia is critical to develop prevention and intervention strategies to both reduce disparities and promote healthy cognitive aging.",Midlife cognitive aging in Hispanic/Latinos:  Predictors and mechanisms of decline,9578599,U01AG060164,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' California ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' cost shifting ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Inflammation ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Maintenance ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' processing speed ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' social integration ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Adherence ', ' Population Process ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' discount ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' discounting ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' modifiable risk ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' loved ones ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' higher education ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' protective factors ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,788288,0.15354709465427863
"Remote Ambulatory Cognitive Assessment of African American and Caucasian Adults PROJECT SUMMARY Challenges exist in recruiting and retaining minorities in research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), thereby limiting the ability to elucidate mechanisms for health disparities in AD risk and to adequately measure treatment efficacy in underserved populations. African Americans represent an especially important group to target for research due to their two-fold risk of AD compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians. Advances in technology to evaluate cognitive functioning, particularly the use of mobile applications such as smartphones, offer the promise for overcoming barriers that may limit African American research participation including scheduling difficulties, associated study costs, and examinee/examiner cultural mismatches. Remotely administered neuropsychological measures can be performed at an individual’s convenience, and outcomes can be collected at multiple time points. In the proposed R03 study, we will leverage the resources and volunteers who have signed up for a new community initiative at our institution, the Emory Healthy Aging Study, involving remote engagement of individuals through smartphone technology. The Co-PIs have selected tasks from the cognitive neuroscience literature that are non-proprietary and have strong behavioral and neuroimaging correlates in APOE-ϵ4 carriers, amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD patients, and healthy aging groups. The proposed grant will pilot these measures when administered via smartphones to middle-aged and older African Americans and Caucasians, with the overall goal of determining whether group differences exist that could have diagnostic relevance in future studies. Sixty African American and 60 non-Hispanic Caucasian adults 45-75 years of age will complete the traditional versions and the smartphone adaptations of the cognitive measures in the clinic setting and will then complete the smartphone applications remotely at 3 and 6 months post-baseline assessment. Specific Aims are to 1) Establish reliability of the smartphone applications (both internal consistency and in comparison to the traditional version (inter-modality reliability)) 2) Establish test- retest reliability of the smartphone measures; and 3) Assess adherence rates of the remotely administered smartphone measures. A secondary Aim is to examine factors (i.e., quality of education, socioeconomic status, and vascular comorbidities) that we expect to be correlated with performance on cognitive measures administered via smartphones and that are underlying factors often associated with cognitive performance differences between African Americans and Caucasians. The long-term goal of a future study is to validate these mobile cognitive measures against neuroimaging, genetic, and CSF biomarkers of central amyloidosis. African Americans are especially important group to include in clinical research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to their increased risk for AD compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians. Advances in technology to evaluate cognitive functioning, particularly the use of mobile applications such as smartphones, offer the promise for overcoming barriers that may limit African American research participation including scheduling difficulties, associated study costs, and examinee/examiner cultural mismatches. The findings of high adherence rates and reliability of remote ambulatory cognitive assessment measures in African American adults, and at levels comparable to Caucasian adults, would demonstrate the feasibility of overcoming logistical barriers and could improve recruitment and retention efforts.",Remote Ambulatory Cognitive Assessment of African American and Caucasian Adults,9472886,R03AG055810,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amyloidosis ', ' amyloid disease ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Literature ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Schedule ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Performance ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' response ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' volunteer ', ' healthy aging ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' longitudinal design ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive task ', ' amnestic mild cognitive impairment ', ' recruit ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,78000,0.13169347130511905
"Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Core Center Overall – Project Summary  This application proposes a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSOM) to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD. Our Center will provide innovative resources to examine the contributions of metabolic and vascular factors to early phase transitions from normal aging to MCI and then to AD and other dementias, through coordinated research spanning the translational spectrum. Wake Forest is uniquely equipped to rapidly develop a high-impact ADCC because it has: 1) a deep, interdisciplinary foundation in aging research; 2) specialized expertise in metabolic and vascular factors and their relationship to cognitive aging and dementia; 3) strong ties to an ethnically diverse community with high prevalence of dementia and metabolic/vascular disorders; and 4) exceptional institutional support. The rationale for our theme is based on research showing that metabolic and vascular disorders are highly prevalent, modifiable factors that contribute to the transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias. To promote innovative translational research focused on these factors, the ADCC will enroll an observational multi-ethnic cohort from an existing 15-year study of metabolic/vascular risk, and leverage their extensive data by adding key endpoints to characterize AD and other dementias. The Clinical Core will enroll a separate cohort enriched for metabolic/vascular risk, along with participants with AD. The ADCC will focus on African-American (AA) and other underserved groups who are twice as likely to develop AD, and have high rates of diabetes and vascular disease. Specialized resources will be available to ADCC investigators, including non-human primate (NHP) models for translational research. A repository of human and NHP biospecimens, genetic/epigenetic data, and extensive clinical data will be available to NACC, NCRAD, and other investigators. The ADCC will also serve as a resource for a broad spectrum of AD initiatives. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Establish a comprehensive integrated research infrastructure focused on phase transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias, and provide special resources to accelerate research on metabolic and vascular factors; 2) Optimize the participation of AA adults to better understand the causes underlying their increased risk of AD and dementia; 3) Expand relationships with the national ADCC network and key affiliates such as NACC and NCRAD; 4) Provide training in translational research to new investigators, and education regarding AD and dementia to professionals, patients and families, and the community. The prevalence of metabolic and vascular risk factors, their importance to AD expression, the strengths of the Wake Forest scientific community in these research areas, and our outstanding institutional commitment are indicators that NIH funding will be successfully leveraged to establish an ADCC that will make high-impact contributions to the field. Overall – Project Narrative  This application seeks to establish a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine that will provide a comprehensive infrastructure for translational, interdisciplinary research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD and related disorders. Our ADCC will focus on the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and then to AD and other dementias, and understanding the contribution of metabolic and vascular factors to these transitions.

"Culture-Gene Relationship:  A Novel Model of Aging Cognitive Health Abstract  To reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), scientists and policy makers have called for new models of the disease. The proposed project tests a novel model of how culture and genes may interact to influence AD and cognitive health. This project will provide the first investigation of whether a modifiable, culture-based environmental factor, negative age beliefs, exacerbates the effect of the genetic-risk-factor apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4) on adverse cognitive outcomes, including risk for AD, and whether positive age beliefs increase the likelihood that APOE ε2 leads to beneficial cognitive outcomes, including reduced AD risk. The proposed project builds on our findings with older individuals that (a) negative age beliefs can lead to greater stress, worse cognitive outcomes, and a greater accumulation of AD biomarkers; and (b) positive age beliefs can protect against these outcomes. This project also builds on the finding that APOE ε4 and ε2 account for less than half of aging-cognition variance; age beliefs may help to explain the remaining variance. Our proposed project with older persons will examine four specific aims for the first time: Aim 1. To examine whether the APOE genotype moderates age beliefs' impact on cognitive outcomes. We predict: (a) APOE ε4 carriers will show a greater detrimental impact of negative age beliefs on cognitive outcomes, compared to non-APOE ε4 carriers; and (b) APOE ε2 carriers will show a greater beneficial impact of positive age beliefs on cognitive outcomes, compared to non-APOE ε2 carriers. Aim 2. To examine whether our age belief-APOE genotype model helps to explain disparities by race and sex on cognitive outcomes. Considering that members of marginalized groups may be more sensitive to age stereotypes, we predict: (a) African Americans will show a stronger additive influence of APOE ε4 and negative age beliefs on detrimental cognitive outcomes, as well as a stronger additive influence of APOE ε2 and positive age beliefs on beneficial cognitive outcome, compared to Whites; and (b) women, compared to men, will show the same pattern as older African Americans described in Aim 2a. Aim 3. To examine whether psychosocial factors, related to age beliefs, influence Aim 1 patterns. We predict: (a) those higher in vulnerability factors (e.g., perceived discrimination) will show a stronger additive influence of APOE ε4 and negative age beliefs on detrimental cognitive outcomes, as well as a weaker additive influence of APOE ε2 and positive age beliefs on beneficial cognitive outcomes; and (b) those higher in resiliency factors (e.g., feeling useful to others) will show the reverse pattern. Aim 4. To examine whether psychological and behavioral mechanisms link the age belief-genotype predictor to cognitive outcomes. We predict: stress and physical activity will act as mediators of this association.  This proposed project will draw on three longitudinal datasets with common key variables. This study meets the NIA priority to identify factors that could help explain disparities in AD risk by race and sex. Narrative  The proposed project presents and tests a new model of how culture and genes may interact to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive health. Since the cultural factor, age beliefs, can be modified, this project could lead to developing interventions that reduce the risk of AD.",Culture-Gene Relationship:  A Novel Model of Aging Cognitive Health,9526962,U01AG032284,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' Cognition ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Woman ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' APOE\xa0e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' Measures ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,418750,0.11699699950311143
"Role of midlife cardiovascular disease on Alzheimer’s Pathology and cerebrovascular reactivity in the young-old. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to the presence of cardiovascular disease (CaVD), understanding the relationship between amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and CaVD is critically important. The overarching goal of this study is to further the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology, including Aβ and tau pathology and neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular reactivity and midlife CaVD. To achieve these goals, we will utilize a group non-demented participants from an existing cohort from the ongoing community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with a cohort of 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years at study entry and has collected a wealth of longitudinal vascular measures. We hypothesize that subclinical CaVD identified in midlife is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease pathology expressed as amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration. These changes in brain structure would be associated with alterations in cognition both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We further hypothesize that the change in cognition will result from a failure of vascular compensatory responses, marked by increases in regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CaVD) are two of the most common disorders of aging, understanding the relationship between the pathologies of these two disorders is critically important. The goal of this study is to furthe the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology and midlife CaVD. We will utilize a group 80 participants with a wealth of existing CaVD data from the Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years.

"Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) provides Georgia and the region with comprehensive clinical, research, and educational programs. This renewal application outlines our success in building an environment that encourages and supports innovative projects with a general theme of discovery and translation of new targets and mechanisms to enable early identification, early interventions, and ultimately prevention of AD. Given the well documented disparities in clinical research participation and burden of disease for AD in the African American community, the Emory ADRC focuses special effort to understand and address inter-individual differences in AD, ranging from ethno-racial factors to personal differences in genetic and protein variation. We benefit from generous institutional support from Emory, one of the nation's fastest growing research academic medical centers, the generous Atlanta community, and a highly collaborative team from more than 20 departments and centers. Five Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology, and Outreach Recruitment and Education), coordinate activities to effectively recruit, evaluate, and engage a diverse cohort of volunteers who actively participate in a wide variety of research studies that aim to better define the trajectory from normal cognitive aging to symptomatic stages of disease. Data from the Cores are captured and stored for distribution to local researchers and for national collaborations. Our biospecimen banks include well-characterized neuropathological case materials, blood and CSF, and DNA. These valuable resources are distributed widely for a variety of approved studies of genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and pathological investigations. The ADRC educational programs reach a broad audience of students, health care professionals, and the public. Three cutting edge research projects are closely integrated with ADRC Cores: Project 1, AD Biomarkers and Endothelial Dysfunction in Caucasians and African Americans, is a longitudinal biomarker study with full integration into the ADRC Clinical Core and OREC, leveraging a unique community based Registry for Remembrance to facilitate recruitment of African Americans; Project 2, A Proteogenomic Approach to Understanding AD GWAS Results, proposes to use state-of-the art targeted gene resequencing and mass spectrometer-based protein sequencing to advance understanding of genetic risk of AD by genetic loci by linking novel gene variants at 20+ recently identified loci directly with the encoded and expressed protein variants in AD brain in an allele specific manner; Project 3, Defining the Properties of Pathogenic Aβ strains in Alzheimer's Disease, takes an interdisciplinary approach to build on pioneering work showing AD brain extracts are transmissible in animal models, by investigating how structural differences in Aβ strains from asymptomatic vs. symptomatic stages of AD vary in their seeding and propagation in yeast and animal models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Emory ADRC has grown dramatically during the past funding cycles (years 6-10), and now seeks a 3rd renewal (years 11-15). The ADRC contributes to the NIH/NIA-funded network and plays a critical role in the coordinated response to the growing public health threat from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emory's active participation in the network fosters research to understand the causes, investigate novel targets and interventions that will lead to more effective treatments and prevention, and improve the treatment of affected individuals with AD and related conditions, and the well being of their family caregivers.",Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center,9476186,P50AG025688,"['Academic Medical

"OLFACTORY IMPAIRMENT IN OFFSPRING STUDY OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE We plan to test the 12-item BSIT, a short, standardized, cross-culturally validated subset of the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), in an add-on study to the recently funded project “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease” (RF1 AG054070). Middle-aged offspring (age 40-64) of parents who participated in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) are being studied with clinical and neuropsychological evaluation (n=3,000), high-resolution structural MRI (n=1,000), and Aβ PET (n=150). In the years 2004-2010, over one-third (n=1,369) of the intensively studied parent cohort had odor identification testing with the full 40-item UPSIT.  Odor identification impairment distinguishes dementia from cognitively intact controls, predicts transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, and predicts cognitive decline in older adults without dementia better than episodic verbal memory deficits. Further, odor identification impairment has been associated with increased mortality even after controlling for dementia and medical comorbidity in older adults, and in this offspring study, mortality will become an important outcome if longitudinal follow-up is instituted eventually. In the proposed cross-sectional study, we hypothesize that in the cohort of 3,000 offspring, lower BSIT scores (impaired odor identification) will be associated with increased age and the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele, and correlate with impaired cognitive ability in Whites (increased incipient AD pathology) to a greater extent than in African Americans or Hispanics (increased incipient cerebrovascular pathology). In the 1,000 offspring that get MRI brain scans, we expect that lower BSIT scores will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and cortical thinning in Whites but not African Americans or Hispanics. In the 150 offspring that get amyloid PET scans, lower BSIT scores are anticipated to be associated with greater amyloid uptake among Whites, but not among African Americans or Hispanics. We will also evaluate BSIT in the offspring in relation to parental BSIT performance and risk of AD in the parents. We have begun pilot work in administering the BSIT to the first 300 offspring being studied, and expect to be able to assess all study participants with the BSIT, without loss of any BSIT data, if this proposal is funded. Our overarching goal is to identify priority biological or social factors for intervention during the preclinical stage of AD, and determine whether strategies to prevent AD should differ across race/ethnicity. Adding odor identification testing furthers these goals in the existing project and allows for the testing of specific hypotheses that will enhance our understanding of the associations and potential utility of this inexpensive early biomarker of AD.   Based on the knowledge that impairment in odor identification predicts both cognitive decline and the transition from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults, we plan to test the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) in 3,000 offspring as an add-on study to the recently funded project “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease” (RF1 AG054070).

"Education and the Life-Course Pathways of Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, and Cognitive Decline in the United States and Mexico PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of the proposed research is to describe and cross-nationally compare the life-course pathways affecting cognition, cognitive impairment, dementia, and cognitive decline in the United States and Mexico. The PI, Dr. Joseph Saenz, received his Ph.D. in Population Health Science at the University of Texas Medical Branch where he received training in epidemiology and epidemiologic methods. Dr. Saenz has extensive experience studying health disparities in Mexico and the Mexican origin population in the United States. Joseph is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California (USC) where he has begun to study cognition in these populations. The proposed training will enhance the PI’s understanding of the measurement of cognition, and expose him to the approaches to cognitive aging used across various academic disciplines including demography, psychology, neuropsychology, and biology. Education is a strong predictor of cognitive function, cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), and dementia in late life. Education may affect the clinical manifestation of cognitive functioning directly by impacting the strength and structure of brain structures and by providing greater cognitive reserve to compensate for pathological changes in the brain. However, education may also affect cognition via indirect pathways including occupation, income, wealth, healthcare access, and chronic conditions. Understanding these pathways is highly significant given the aging of the U.S. and Mexican populations and the social and economic costs of cognitive impairment. Because aging is a life-course process that occurs within larger contexts, it is important to consider how larger demographic, economic, and political contexts across countries influence cognitive development and decline throughout the life-course. Further, by acknowledging these differing contexts, future work may design and implement cognitive interventions that are more precisely catered to the context in which they are applied. These results also shed light on differences in cognitive aging across developing and developed countries. While studies of aging in Mexico (Mexican Health and Aging Study) and the U.S. (Health and Retirement Study) have used differing measures of cognitive functioning and methods for measuring and classifying normal cognition, CIND, and dementia, the proposed research makes use of newly collected harmonized assessments of cognitive functioning to develop comparable measures of cognition and definitions of CIND and dementia. I will investigate the direct and indirect pathways throughout the life-course through which education affects cognitive functioning, CIND, dementia, and cognitive decline in late life using multinomial probit regression models, growth curve models, and linear regression models to model CIND and dementia, cognitive decline, and cognitive function as a function of variables spanning the life-course. USC is an ideal location to receive the training necessary for the proposal given the multidisciplinary nature of the gerontology center, global study of aging, focus on cognition and dementia, and availability of coursework and mentorship from leaders in demography, psychology, and clinical psychology. This training will also position the PI to begin an independent research career and to submit a successful R01 proposal in a faculty position. PROJECT NARRATIVE Education is strongly predictive of cognitive function and cognitive impairment in late life, the proposed research will cross-nationally examine the direct and indirect life-course pathways through which education influences cognition in late life in Mexico and the United States. These results will deepen our understanding of the role of education in cognitive function, and how larger demographic and social contexts may modify the pathogenesis of disease. Findings will suggest how, and at what stage of the life-course, societal resources should be allocated to be used most effectively.","Education and the Life-Course Pathways of Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, and Cognitive Decline in the United States and Mexico",9505164,K99AG058799,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' California ', ' Cognition ', ' Financial cost ', ' Demography ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexico ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Pathology ', ' Politics ', ' Population Growth ', ' Psychology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Texas ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' career ', ' rural area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' cognitive function ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' health knowledge ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' economic cost ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' cost ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' population health ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K99,2018,75341,0.11038927676254708

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Ethnically Diverse Cohorts for the ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) PROJECT SUMMARY  The Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national sequencing initiative focused on identifying genetic risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in an effort to identify new pathways for prevention and new targets for drug development. The projects’ discovery phase included whole exome sequencing (WES) of 10,914 unrelated cases (N=5,778) and controls (N=5,136) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,019 familial samples. A majority of these samples are non-Hispanic white (NHW) in origin, making the addition of ethnically diverse samples to the study critical to identification of both shared and novel genetic risk factors for AD between populations. This ethnic diversity was emphasized in the ‘ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) Phase’ planning stage with a directive that additional existing cohorts with unrelated AD cases that ‘encompass the richest possible ethnic diversity’ be given the highest priority for inclusion.  To fulfill the goals of this RFA and this FUS Phase Mandate, this proposal identifies seven existing elderly cohorts of African-American (AA) and pan-HI ancestry with a total of 10,430 samples (N=2,322 AA AD cases and 1,843 AA controls and 2,928 Hispanic AD cases and 2,875 Hispanic controls) for WGS and processing in collaboration with existing NIH-funded AD infrastructure. Combining these cohorts with existing African America (AA) and Hispanic (HI) sequencing from the Washington Heights-Hamilton Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the ADSP will provide large ethnically diverse datasets for both validation of ADSP discovery phase findings and discovery of novel risk and/or protective variants for AD. Importantly, these data will allow for admixture mapping, a powerful method of gene mapping for diseases that show differential risk by ancestry, by comparing allele frequency differences between populations. They will also become an invaluable resource for the AD research community at-large, and will help to address the health disparities that contribute to AA and HI populations having higher rates of AD than NHW. Thus, we will address these important issues by creating a large dataset of AA and pan-HI AD cases and controls for study.  Specifically we propose to: 1) increase the ethnic diversity of the ADSP by assembling samples from existing cohorts with AA and HI AD cases and controls; 2) collaborate with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) in assemblage, storage, and distribution of DNA on these cohorts; 3) generating genome-wide SNP array data and WGS for all collected samples; and 4) collaborate with the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) in processing, quality controls, storage and distribution of the final datasets. Our overall goal is to enhance the discovery of AD risk factors by facilitating research on AD in ethnically diverse datasets.

"Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this proposal, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a presidentially initiated effort to understand the genetics of AD in hopes of developing new targets for therapies. Currently lacking in these efforts, however, is the inclusion of African American (AA) populations and the generalization of research findings to AA communities.

"School Quality and Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease in Project Talent The American Institutes for Research (AIR) will provide staff for the School Quality and Racial Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease in Project Talent study and will assist Dr. Jennifer Manly (PI, Columbia University) in activities to create shared data resources and to support all aspects of this research project. Socioeconomic adversity in early life is a risk factor for poor brain health—impaired cognitive function and cerebrovascular disease—in later life, but some individuals are resilient, achieving better-than-expected outcomes despite facing early life adversity. The mechanisms of resilience, as well as the causal pathways between early life adversity and later life brain health, are unclear, but educational experiences are very likely critical. This project will focus on mortality, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health conditions that increase risk for cerebrovascular disease, all outcomes that have been linked to early life socioeconomic adversity, and will evaluate the role of educational experiences in potentially promoting resilience to early life adversity. A central research question in our evaluation of school quality and long term impacts on brain health is whether there are racial/ethnic differences in the benefits of attending higher quality schools or the mechanisms though which education influences later health. The study will include ~9000 participants, currently aged 69-74, to assess cognitive abilities, health, and other aspects of resilience. Other innovations of this study include: a contemporary battery of cognitive abilities measures harmonized with several of the original 1960 measures, allowing direct measurement of change across 1960 to 2017 on multiple cognitive abilities; use of adaptive testing to reduce participant burden; and assessment via mailed tablet computers to facilitate measurement of memory and visuospatial abilities. This study has many advantages, including its sample size, prospective design, high quality measurement of multiple cognitive abilities in adolescence and older adulthood, assessment of educational quality and experiences, cognitive complexity of occupational and leisure activities, all in the context of its unique design that provides an unprecedented opportunity to address causal hypotheses.

"Understanding the needs and experiences of surrogate decision makers caring for SGM individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. ABSTRACT Facing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) in a loved one is challenging under any circumstances, but may be even more challenging when the patient or their decision maker is a sexual or gender minority (SGM). While SGM individuals have become a more visible part of society, there is accumulating evidence of health disparities among SGM older adults. Although Dr. Alexia Torke’s K24 proposal has provided support for secondary analysis of data addressing the emotional, spiritual and religious aspects of surrogate decision making, this dataset is not large enough to include the number of SGM participants needed to conduct rigorous research on the experience of this vulnerable population. Given the risk of ADRD in the aging population, further primary data collection is needed to understand the perspectives of surrogates caring for SGM patients with ADRD, in order to develop interventions that improve the quality of decisions and the surrogate’s experience. Specific aims of this supplement proposal are to understand the needs and experiences of surrogate decision makers caring for SGM individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias and to develop and pilot test a survey assessing SGM individuals’ understanding of and engagement in the surrogate decision making process. We will first qualitatively interview 25-30 surrogate decision makers who have recently cared for SGM individuals or currently caring for SGM individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias. We will purposefully sample a mix of individuals where the surrogate is a SGM or not but caring for a SGM individual. We will then develop a survey based on findings in Aim 1 regarding the needs and challenges of surrogate decision making. Refine the survey using cognitive interviewing with a small sample of 25 SGM older adults. Results of this study will be used to 1) validate the survey to asses understanding of and engagement in the surrogate decision making process for SGM patients, 2) inform the development of an intervention designed to increase the quality and quantity of engagement with advance care planning among SGM communities, and 3) better prepare surrogates caring for SGM people. This supplement will further the aims of Dr. Torke’s original K24 proposal, to mentor the next generation of surrogate decision making researchers and to further understand the mechanisms of surrogate decision making. Dr. Torke will mentor Dr. Carey Candrian, a researcher who has conducted studies in advance care planning in the SGM community. NARRATIVE There are currently 1.1. million SGM adults in the United States 65 years and older and by 2030 there will be about 7 million. Given the incidence of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias, many of these older adults will need a surrogate decision maker. By addressing the additional challenges faced by surrogates for SGM patients, this research will contribute to high quality medical decision making for persons with ADRD.",Understanding the needs and experiences of surrogate decision makers caring for SGM individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.,9931904,K24AG053794,"['Emotional ', ' end of life care ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Security ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' neglect ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' loved ones ', ' surrogate decision maker ', ' sexual minority ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' same-sex marriage ', ' gender minority ', ' secondary analysis ', ' minority communities ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' cognitive interview ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Alexia ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Priorities ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Prejudice ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Single Person ', ' Maritally Unattached ', ' Unmarried person ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Friends ', ' Family member ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' experience ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' treatment planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K24,2019,99545,0.03260381936197631
"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS) Renewal The vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is a critical area of research related to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the AD-related dementias (ADRD), particularly given its value in identifying areas for intervention and prevention. This proposal is a renewal application to the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS), a community-based cohort from four U.S. communities, which, when first funded in 2011-2013, added detailed cognitive evaluation and adjudication of mild cognitive impairment (MCI and dementia, along with brain imaging and new vascular and cardiac markers, to 25 years of careful measurement and collection of cardiovascular risk factors, markers, and events through the parent ARIC study. Our previous studies have demonstrated the importance of midlife vascular risk factors in the development of later-life cognitive decline, dementia, and amyloid deposition, and, given the biracial structure of the cohort, have considered racial disparities in some of these risk factors and outcomes. In this renewal, we propose to not only study these cognitive impairments at older cohort ages with greater rates of MCI and dementia, in order to identify subsets which may offer potential avenues for late-life prevention of AD/ADRD's, but also to consider if similar midlife risk factors impact late-life physical function declines, as this may represent a parallel and possibly alternative pathway to prevention of both physical function impairment and AD/ADRD's. Furthermore, we will evaluate factors associated with maintenance of cognitive and physical function, as well as the concept of cognitive reserve: better-than-expected scores or less-than-expected decline for an observed level of brain pathology. To pursue these questions, we will perform annual visits of the ARIC cohort, for four total visits, with detailed neurocognitive testing and brain imaging with MRI and florbetapir PET in 1000 participants, to build upon the prior 30+ years' worth of detailed vascular risk factor and marker and lifestyle measurements, starting when participants were middle-aged. The size and diversity of our cohort allows us to conduct sex- and race-specific analyses. This renewal will provide valuable information about opportunities for prevention for AD/ADRD's, with direct relevance not only to the recent ADRD summit recommendations, but also the first goal of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) to prevent and treat AD by 2025. Through our ongoing data sharing endeavors and collaborations with other studies, as well as the opportunities provided for ancillary studies building on the ARIC NCS study, the study will reach beyond the proposed aims described here. One of the most promising avenues for prevention of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias is through the prevention of vascular risk. This renewal application will build upon our prior studies, which demonstrated the importance of midlife vascular risk factors in the development of cognitive decline and dementia, by also considering factors associated with maintenance of both cognitive and physical function. Finally, this study will identify potential targets for prevention by evaluating a concept called cognitive reserve, which refers to maintenance of cognitive function despite abnormalities seen on brain imaging; this set of studies could contribute to prevention and reduction in the worldwide burden of Alzheimer's and other dementias.",ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)

"Proteomics of Hypertension and Alzheimer's Disease in African Americans Project Summary African Americans (AAs) are two to three times more likely to have Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related- dementias than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AAs comprise 20 percent of AD sufferers to-date, while only making up 13 percent of the US population. AAs with AD also have high incidences of vascular risk factors including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. The prevalence of hypertension for AAs in the US is 47% and occurs at early adult ages. Hypertension is a major risk factor for AD and related-dementias especially when present in mid-life. Because of this inherent relationship between hypertension and AD especially in AAs, the question must be asked “What are the underlying biochemical pathways that link hypertension and AD in AAs”? This proposal directly responds to the goal of PA-15-349 by “examining mediators of disparities in Alzheimer's disease, using diverse cohorts of subjects”. Specially, we propose to examine biochemical markers of hypertension, which is a mediator of racial disparities and increases AD risk in AAs. Based on preliminary proteomics data in obtained our laboratory, our working hypothesis is that shared biological responses in immune response and lipid metabolism pathways contribute to both high prevalence of hypertension and AD in AAs. Alterations in both immune response and lipid metabolism pathways are well recognized as contributors to AD, and also play roles in hypertension. We have assembled a stellar team of interdisciplinary experts in the areas of Alzheimer's and vascular diseases and will study biospecimens from diverse cohorts of African American participants that focus on hypertension, AD, or AD risk: BioVU, Rush ADC Clinical Core/MARS/ROSMAP, Vanderbilt MAP, and Offspring. We will use advanced proteomic approaches to study plasma and postmortem brain tissue from participants in these cohorts and complete two primary aims. Aim 1. Establishing the molecular signature of hypertension in AAs and Aim 2. Establishing the molecular signature of AD in AAs. Successfully identifying proteomics signatures will lead to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and the molecular architecture of hypertension, a major vascular risk factor for AD in AAs. This proposal is highly innovative, ambitious, extremely urgent, and will provide critical information about disease biology in a population that has been underrepresented throughout the current literature. Project Narrative: African Americans are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease in the US. Hypertension is a risk factor for AD and how it fully contributes to increased AD risk and prevalence in AAs has yet to be determined. This proposal seeks to understand biochemical pathways which link hypertension and Alzheimer's disease in African Americans by using large-scale proteomics analyses.",Proteomics of Hypertension and Alzheimer's Disease in African Americans,9839233,R01AG064950,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' microtubule associated protein 4 ', ' MAP4 ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical Markers ', ' Link ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' normotensive ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Chemosensitization ', ' Potentiation ', ' Chemosensitization/Potentiation ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' brain tissue ', ' fatty acid transport ', ' lipid metabolism ', ' fat metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Proteomics ', ' repository ', ' Pulse Pressure ', ' cholesterol metabolism ', ' Cholesterol Homeostasis ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' high risk ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' University resources ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' proteomic signature ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,888255,0.06290725893556713
"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Online Small-Group Self-Management Workshop for Rural Caregivers of Individuals with Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT SUMMARY  Among 13 million informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias, an estimated 1.4 million live in rural areas of the US. These caregivers are a vulnerable group due to their physical isolation and well-documented rural disparities in health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is an pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers so that they can sustain their own well-being and effective caregiving within the home environments of their loved ones.  Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home environment and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related forms of dementia. In our evaluations of the program in non-randomized studies, caregivers experienced significant improvements in stress, depression symptoms, and self-efficacy and partners experienced improved well-being.  Building on these encouraging preliminary findings, we now propose to conduct a hybrid effectiveness- implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: 320 in the intervention (workshop) group and 320 in the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited through 19 community organizations (serving rural communities in 17 states). Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depression symptoms. We hypothesize that stress scores and depression symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. We will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. We will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.  If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 13 million informal, mostly unpaid caregivers (“caregivers”) provide critical support to US adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, enabling them the remain in their homes and communities. But many dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to these responsibilities, including caregivers who live in rural settings where resources and support may be difficult to access. The proposed project will determine whether a 6-week online self-management and skills-building workshop called Building Better Caregivers improves the well-being of isolated dementia caregivers who live in rural settings and also whether the workshop has the potential to be widely disseminated to such caregivers throughout rural America.",Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Online Small-Group Self-Management Workshop for Rural Caregivers of Individuals with Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias,9789138,R01AG057855,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Persons ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Program Accessibility ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Friends ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Family member ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' uptake ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' implementation trial ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' rural disparities ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' loved ones ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' attentional control ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' dementia caregiving ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' stress symptom ', ' rural America ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' recruit ', ' self-management program ', ' clinical implementation ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,767176,0.06764121251806139
"National Social Life, Health and Aging:  Wave 4 The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study which extends our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. The project is unique among nationally representative studies of older adults in the breadth and detail of health data collected, incorporating physical, psychological, sensory, functional, cognitive and social measures. In particular, we have unparalleled longitudinal measures of changes in the structure of social networks and relationships of respondents and their partners throughout the study as well as information on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). We propose to conduct in-home interviews in 2020–21 (Wave 4 [W4]) with all surviving respondents and their spouses/partners from the first three waves (W1-W3), providing 15 years of follow-up and four waves of data on this important cohort (aged 72-100 at W4). For innovations introduced in W2— a multi-domain measure of cognition (the MoCA-SA), detailed olfactory assessment, complete data from spouses/partners, an accelerometry study of sleep and daily activity, and more comprehensive measures in all domains—W4 will provide a third data point needed to model changes in health, associations, and causal relationships between them. We will enhance the data with new measures of cognition, including item response times, proxy reports, and diagnosis of ADRDs; linking to administrative data files, such as Medicare; and objectively measuring, concurrently, all five classic senses. As one example, W4 will allow the testing of key hypotheses regarding cognitive changes from normal function through dementia, providing important insights into Alzheimer's disease.  With these data, we aim to extend our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. Additionally, we will develop a framework for enrolling the oldest NSHAP subjects into internal and external investigator initiated studies addressing novel social, behavioral, and clinical questions (such as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and related dementias) in representative samples of this historically understudied population. With its rich and novel measures of social networks and of the biological, physical and psychological components of health—all measured longitudinally from both partners in a couple—NSHAP is uniquely poised to bridge the gap between large, epidemiological studies of social relationships and health and experimental studies of the mechanisms involved. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study which extends our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. In 2020-21, NSHAP W4 will collect information on the health and wellbeing of Americans ages 72 to 100 and their partners.

"Collaborative Approach for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Research and Education (CARE) in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias. Project Abstract/Summary of CARE Alzheimer's disease is the fourth leading cause of death in California compared to sixth in the U.S., and the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is expected to increase from 5.7 to 14 million by 2050. It is important to ensure that underserved communities, such as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), are engaged and educated on ADRD as disparities exist in knowledge about ADRD among AAPI and Asian American caregivers experience disparities in depression, burden, and physical health compared to non-Hispanic White caregivers even though AAPI are the most rapidly growing racial group of older Americans at risk for ADRD. Research participation from AAPI are limited and the sparse research suggests that AAPI are interested in being engaged, but that various concerns (e.g. lack of cultural/linguistic information and mistrust) need to be addressed in order to improve participation in ADRD research, including clinical trials participation. To overcome these barriers to ADRD clinical research participation, we will implement culturally appropriate and innovative recruitment strategies from a collaborative team of trusted sources of information (e.g. community partners). The ultimate goal of the proposed project, Collaborative Approach for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Research and Education (CARE) in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, is to address the gap and reduce disparities in ADRD research participation among AAPI through the creation of a registry of AAPI who are interested in participating in various types of ADRD research. CARE will be conducted in five languages (English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Korean) across four sites in California (San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento County, Los Angeles County, and Orange County). CARE is critical to ensure that AAPI, an underserved population, are meaningfully included in ADRD research. CARE will accomplish the following: a) Develop a registry that will facilitate future ADRD research with AAPI; b) Serve as a recruitment model for other populations; c) Increase the capacity of AD Centers/Institutes at and develop a new collaborative team across five universities; and, d) Develop a robust approach and add to the science of recruiting and retaining minorities in research with the overall goal of reducing ADRD disparities.

"Alzheimer’s care management in minority groups: Identifying warning signs and crisis points in transitions from informal to formal care management in African American and Latino populations Project Abstract Alzheimer's is a growing concern in Hispanic and African American populations, with increased incidence and earlier age of onset as compared to the non-Hispanic White population. Informal caregivers provide the majority of care for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD),with Hispanic and African American caregivers accessing formal care systems less frequently and at later stages compared to non-Hispanic White families. Community organizations serving persons with Alzheimer's in Milwaukee county long recognize the lag in informal care systems transitioning primary care management to formal paid care, waiting until a crisis in inability to provide care, and/or inability to maintain the health and safety for the patient within the informal care system occurs. However, it is unclear what early warning signs preceded the crisis and what formal care providers, including physicians, social work, nursing, family workers and dementia care specialists, know about warning signs and crisis in these families. Data and discussions from a multi-stakeholder community coalition suggest that formal and informal systems of care may diverge in their interpretation of early warning signs, crisis points and cultural considerations around care transitions. Thus assessing what both the caregiver and healthcare professional know about early warning signs and how both groups interpret this information will inform the development of culturally adapted, pre-crisis interventions. This study aims to identify both family and formal care providers' views of care transitions, warning signs and care crisis points, and where their views of these situations both converge and diverge. The proposed study will collect family and service provider level data from up to 240 African American and Hispanic family caregivers (including adult and youth key informants), and 50 service providers recruited through a community coalition, including the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Medical College of Wisconsin, The United Community Center, Alzheimer's Association and Milwaukee County Department on Aging. This study will be the first to identify culturally relevant warning signs to guide the development of culturally adapted informal and formal educational interventions with African American and Hispanic communities, designed to avert care crises. It will also nuance the caregiving paradigm through the inclusion of youth caregivers, providing the first insight into the youth view of caregiving transitions and what they see as warning signs and crisis points, adding dimension to informal caregiving knowledge and programming. The proposed study engages several community-based service providers, focusing on the need to understanding cultural issues in caregiving through the lens of organizations that are accessed and trusted by the target population. Results will contribute to the NIA mission to improve the well-being of AD patients and caregivers by developing a better understanding of caregiving needs and the disparities inherent in the transition from informal to formal care management. Narrative statement This study is relevant to both the mission of the NIA and public health by providing information on previously unknown warning signs and care crisis points leading to a transition of primary care between informal and formal care management in African American and Hispanic families with Alzheimer's or related dementias (ADRD). Utilizing a community based approach, this study uniquely engages adult and youth caregivers, and community based service providers to assess early warning signs and disparities identified by informal caregivers and formal care providers. Results are expected to inform care coordination and education interventions for underserved African American and Hispanic patients with ADRD, caregivers and formal acre providers.",Alzheimer’s care management in minority groups: Identifying warning signs and crisis points in transitions from informal to formal care management in African American and Latino populations,9647724,R21AG061307,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Crisis Intervention ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Age of Onset ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cooking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' forgetting ', ' Familiarity ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' elder care ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' community based service ', ' community organizations ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' efficacy testing ', ' community center ', ' informal care ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' informal caregiving ', ' Informal care giving ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Formal caregiver ', ' Formal care giver ', ' dementia care ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' service providers ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2019,231517,0.0684988176461543
"Educational and Early Life Predictors of Mild Cognitive Impairment: New Evidence about Mediators and Moderators from High School & Beyond PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Education is among the most important predictors of cognitive functioning and cognitive impairment (including MCI and AD/ADRD). However, because scientists do not know how or why education matters for these cognitive outcomes, it is difficult to design effective interventions. There is currently very little information about (a) the specific aspects of education that prevent or provide resilience to cognitive impairment and (b) the pathways through which those effects operate. A major reason for this lack of information about how or why education matters for these cognitive outcomes is that data on educational opportunities, environments, and attainments have mainly been gathered via retrospective reports. To know how and why education matters for cognitive functioning and impairment, the scientific community needs high quality prospective studies that follow young people through schools and throughout adulthood, measures key and modifiable aspects of education, and then assess cognitive functioning later in life. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of leading neurologists, neuropsychologists, sociologists, education scientists, and survey methodologists who will design protocols to re-contact all ≈25,500 surviving members the High School & Beyond (HSB) cohort—a nationally representative random sample of Americans first interviewed in high school in 1980—and use the resulting data to conduct transformative analyses of the effects of education on cognitive function and risk for impairment at midlife. The project has five aims: (Aim 1) To estimate the effects of (a) adolescent cognitive and non-cognitive skills, (b) secondary school course taking and college field of study, and (c) other school structures and social environments on cognitive functioning and impairment at midlife; (Aim 2) To assess the degree to which racial/ethnic differences in those aspects of education explain racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive functioning and impairment; (Aim 3) To assess the degree to which the effects of education are mediated by educational attainment, economic strain, and the cognitive complexity of paid jobs at midlife; and (Aim 4) To assess the degree to which race/ethnicity and genetic risk factors moderate the effects of education on cognitive functioning and impairment. To gather the data required to pursue these Aims, the investigators will conduct an internet/phone survey and gather genetic material via a mail-back saliva kit. (Aim5) The resulting database and associated documentation and metadata will be made freely available to the research community to facilitate scholarship on the development of MCI, AD/ADRD, and cognitive decline. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will transform our understanding of the implications of education for cognitive functioning, cognitive impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) and cognitive aging later in life. Using a unique prospective longitudinal data source (High School and Beyond), it will allow us to answer questions about (a) whether social and educational disparities by race/ethnicity in adolescence shape racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment at midlife; (b) whether biological and social factors moderate the effects of education on cognitive functioning and impairment; and (c) the social and economic pathways through which those effects operate over the life course. Quantifying the magnitude of the effects of education on cognitive functioning and impairment will inform efforts to use educational and other interventions to improve the midlife cognitive functioning of future cohorts of Americans.",Educational and Early Life Predictors of Mild Cognitive Impairment: New Evidence about Mediators and Moderators from High School &

"Lifestyle Behaviors and Racial Differences in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: One in ten Americans age 65 and older are currently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Although Alzheimer’s disease was identified more than 100 years ago, racial disparities in the disease continue to persist. Research has consistently indicated that among all racial groups, African Americans have the highest Alzheimer’s disease risk, which is nearly twice as high compared to White older adults. Despite the wide scientific evidence for this disparity, the reasons for these racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease risk remain unclear. Prior research indicates that lifestyle behaviors are associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. Further, African Americans have been noted to have a higher prevalence of poor lifestyle behaviors associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as physical inactivity and cigarette smoking. While numerous studies have explored how lifestyle behaviors are associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk, there has been no research that has examined whether lifestyle behaviors contribute to racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease. This proposed study explores engagement in three particular lifestyle behaviors: physical activity, cigarette smoking, and social contacts. With this in consideration, the central objective of this study is to investigate the influence of lifestyle behaviors on the differential risk for Alzheimer’s disease/dementia between White and African American older adults. To better understand this relationship, this study has three aims: 1) To determine the influence of lifestyle behaviors on Alzheimer’s disease/dementia risk among older adults, 2) To determine how lifestyle behaviors influence racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease/dementia risk between White and African American older adults, and 3) To determine how race moderates the relationship between lifestyle behaviors and Alzheimer’s disease/dementia risk among older adults. METHODS: This study will use secondary data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a longitudinal panel study that surveys a nationally representative sample of more than 12,000 older adults age 65 and older within the United States. All available NHATS data from 2011 to 2016 will be used for this study. The dependent variable is age of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia diagnosis. The primary independent variables are individual and cumulative engagement in physical activity, smoking, and social contacts. Each aim will be analyzed with Cox proportional hazard models, while controlling for sociodemographics and health. IMPLICATIONS: Findings from this study will offer major implications for public health by providing insight into how certain lifestyle behaviors can influence the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Further, findings from this study may reveal whether lifestyle behaviors contribute to racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease, which may be crucial in addressing racial disparities by indicating which lifestyle behaviors may be especially protective in reducing Alzheimer’s disease risk among African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide insight into how lifestyle behaviors can influence Alzheimer’s disease risk, which could be used by health care professionals to provide targeted interventions for individuals already at a high risk for Alzheimer’s disease due to pre-existing risk factors such as genetics and co-morbidities. Findings may also reveal whether lifestyle behaviors contribute to racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease, which may be crucial in addressing racial disparities by indicating which lifestyle behaviors may be especially protective in reducing Alzheimer’s disease risk among African Americans. Further, findings from this study may encourage public health professionals and policymakers to collaborate and develop Alzheimer’s disease prevention strategies by promoting engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors in daily life, which is important given that there remains no definitive cure or treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.",Lifestyle Behaviors and Racial Differences in Alzheimer's Disease,9650953,R36AG061426,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavior ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lonely ', ' Loneliness ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Smoker ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Life ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' American ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' trend ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' high risk ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R36,2019,46212,0.060617560764061704
"Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia Overall Project Summary The over-arching goal of the Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia (HASD) study is to determine the factors that signal the imminent development of symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) in cognitively normal older adults. In pursuing this goal, HASD also will examine whether these predictive factors differ between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites, are influenced by sleep, or might be offset by genetic variants that protect against developing symptomatic AD. Finally, HASD will evaluate a novel method of assessing cognitive performance in naturalistic settings via a smartphone application. To accomplish these goals, HASD will assess and follow a richly phenotyped cohort that includes both cognitively normal older adults (~75%) and those with early-stage symptomatic AD (~25%). The longitudinal assessment protocol includes standard and novel clinical and cognitive measures, a six-day in-home sleep study, magnetic structural imaging studies of the brain, positron emission tomography studies of the brain to reveal the cerebral hallmarks of AD, amyloid-beta plaques and tau deposition, and examination of blood for genetic studies and of cerebrospinal fluid for levels of amyloid-beta and tau. Five Cores (Administration, Clinical, Biostatistics, Neuropathology [includes the Biofluids Laboratory], and Imaging) will support four Projects that carry out the scientific aims of HASD: Project 1: “Characterization of Molecular Biomarker Profiles of AD throughout its Pathobiological Continuum” Project 2: “Sleep and Orexin: Potential Markers of Progression from Preclinical to Mildly Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease” Project 3: “Dissecting the Genetic Architecture of Resilience” Project 4: “Smartphone-Based `Burst' Cognitive Assessments” Overall Project Narrative The over-arching goal of the Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia (HASD) study is to determine those factors that signal the imminent development of Alzheimer disease (AD) in cognitively normal older adults.

"Role of mid- and late-life risk factors in social inequalities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Project Summary There is consistent evidence linking socioeconomic status (SES) to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Much of the existing research simply quantifies social inequalities in ADRD rather than seek to explain them. Research on other chronic diseases and mortality using a social epidemiological framework has examined the role of multiple risk and protective factors. Our overarching aim is use this approach to identify social, behavioral, and biologic factors actors that mediate the association between socioeconomic status and ADRD. Two features of our project are important. One, we use the lifecourse approach due to the long latent phase of ADRD which can result in modification of risk factors in the preclinical phase of disease. We use three measures of SES (parental SES, own education, adult SES), and risk factors at age 50 and 65 years for mediation analysis. Two, SES is also considered to be a marker of cognitive reserve, in that it modifies the association between neuropathology with clinical dementia. Whether the association of major risk factors of ADRD is also modified by SES is unknown. Our proposal is based on the Whitehall study (N=10,308), a unique resource to study ADRD due to availability of data on multiple risk factors; assessed every 4/5 years over 30 years (1985 to 2016). In three interrelated aims we seek to AIM 1. Identify mid- and late-life risk factors for cognitive impairment and ADRD and test the reserve hypothesis (effect modification). We hypothesize that for midlife risk factors that have a robust association with ADRD, there will be significant effect modification due to the clustering of risk factors with socioeconomic disadvantage. AIM 2. Examine the extent to which risk factors mediate the association of socioeconomic factors with cognitive impairment and ADRD using a causal framework that allows effect modification (moderated mediation). We hypothesize that a considerable proportion of the excess risk will be explained by “indirect” effects, i.e. via the risk factors considered in the model. AIM 3. Examine whether socioeconomic factors modify a) associations of risk factors with neuroimaging measures, and b) the association of neuroimaging measures with ADRD and cognitive impairment in the Whitehall MRI sub-study.. Increasing longevity across the world will exacerbate the societal and economic impact of ADRD in the coming years. The etiology of ADRD is complex and multifactorial; many risk factors are potentially modifiable and understanding their role is important in the drive to reduce inequalities in ADRD. This project is low risk and highly feasible due to data already collected over 30 years in the Whitehall study. Our comprehensive approach aims to identify specific risk factors that underlie socioeconomic differences in risk of ADRD so that they can be targeted via prevention strategies to reduce inequalities. Project Narrative Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease & related dementia (ADRD). Using the research paradigm in the study of chronic diseases we aim to examine the role of environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological factors in explaining social inequalities in ADRD. We use the same set of risk factors assessed at age 50 and at age 65 in order to account for the long preclinical phase of dementias. Knowledge gained from our research will allow well targeted interventions and public health messages to reduce inequalities in ADRD.",Role of mid- and late-life risk factors in social inequalities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,9713293,RF1AG062553,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Inequality ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Shapes ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' social inequality ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' economic impact ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' neuropathology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Modification ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' health inequalities ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' protective factors ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,INSERM PARIS 5,RF1,2019,1497105,0.11848209458738404
"Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias:  The Role of Blood Pressure Throughout Adulthood PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health burden and disproportionately affect African Americans. The mechanisms underlying this disparity are not well-understood, but elevated blood pressure could be key. Compared with whites, African Americans have higher prevalence, earlier age of onset, and greater severity of hypertension. Thus, older African Americans tend to have greater cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure throughout adulthood than older whites. No prior research, however, has quantified the contribution of hypertension to racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. There are significant methodological challenges to addressing this important question, including (1) measurement of cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure from the age of onset of hypertension through late adulthood, (2) measurement of cognitive function in diverse populations, and (3) possible survival bias, which is likely to differentially affect African Americans. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify the extent to which elevated blood pressure from mid- through late- adulthood mediates racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This project uses an innovative approach to examine this important question with existing data from two diverse Northern California cohorts: the University of California, Davis Aging Diversity Cohort and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Multiphasic Health Checkup cohort, which links mid-adulthood physical examinations with long-term medical record information. Analyses will address the three major methodologic challenges outlined above by examining cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure as measured at multiple points in adulthood, developing a novel neuroimaging-based brain health index in a diverse population, and quantifying the potential magnitude of survival bias using comprehensive midlife data to account for differential survival. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) measuring and modeling cognitive function in diverse populations, (2) clinical assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, (3) assessing brain health with neuroimaging, and (4) the biology of vascular disease relevant to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career focused on identifying modifiable determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in diverse populations. The methodological challenges addressed in this project are common to many areas of research on disparities in aging and cumulative exposure to risk factors throughout the lifecourse for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health problem and disproportionally affect African American older adults. Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias have been identified as a national priority by the National Alzheimer’s Project Act. The results of this project will quantify what fraction of racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias could be eliminated by addressing disparities in hypertension.",Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias:  The Role of Blood Pressure Throughout Adulthood,9697379,R00AG053410,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Universities ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' vascular component ', ' vascular factor ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Measurement ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' experience ', ' checkup examination ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' brain health ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2019,236247,0.14490228445878375
"Old SCHOOL Hip Hop: A randomized controlled trial to improve dementia knowledge Objectives: The goals of this proposal are to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel culturally- tailored dementia education intervention to a) teach young children to recognize dementia symptoms and demonstrate an appropriate action plan (which we have termed dementia literacy) and b) have these dementia literate children teach and improve dementia literacy their parents and grandparents. Background: Dementia is common among elderly individuals, becomes more prevalent with age, is medically refractory, reduces life expectancy, and diminishes quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Cultural barriers to dementia diagnosis exist and are potentially modifiable. Interventions that target younger generations may shift cultural perceptions and improve acceptance of dementia and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Emerging evidence suggests that early cognitive impairment may have modifiable or preventable components and a combination of medical and lifestyle interventions may delay or reduce cognitive decline, particularly when delivered early in the course of disease. Health literacy, including perceptions of cognitive aging and awareness of possible modifiable determinants, could be unrealized barriers to diminishing the health disparity of dementia. Youth education programs focused on dementia could increase community dementia awareness, improve AD literacy of parents and grandparents of dementia- literate children, shift cultural perceptions of AD to improve its acceptance, and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Such an approach could uniquely engage minority populations who are least engaged and at greatest risk for AD. Methods: The Intervention. “Old SCHOOL Hip Hop” (Seniors Can Have Optimal aging and Ongoing Longevity) is a validated model using a brief multimedia culturally tailored intervention designed to teach minority children key dementia signs and symptoms, and actions taken when dementia is recognized, which is early clinical evaluation by a physician. Twenty schools (with 3000 total students) will be randomly assigned to either the OSHH intervention arm or attentional control. This program will test the hypotheses that the program will lead to significant improvement of dementia knowledge in parents, and that gains are influenced by child knowledge, the degree of child-parent communication about the topic, and socioeconomic status. The program is additionally designed to create a novel, brief “dementia action test” to fulfill a critical missing tool for efficiently assessing dementia recognition and behavioral response. This project offers a unique opportunity effectively improve multigenerational community dementia knowledge in an era increasingly moving toward time-dependent multimodal disease modifying therapy. Our group's innovative model, pilot data, and recently completed and randomized controlled trial of a similar program in stroke support our approach and collective skill sets and experience providing an unparalleled opportunity to both meet project goals and establish several key steps to meaningfully impact dementia health literacy and potentially health outcomes including early access to

"Alzheimer's disease biomarker disclosure in African Americans and Whites – Personal and programmatic consequences of knowing ATN status PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, using neuroimaging and spinal fluid procedures has shifted research towards symptom prevention and trials of disease-modifying therapies during the preclinical stage. Although AD is evolving from a clinical to a biomarker-based diagnosis characterized by amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (“ATN”), the psychological consequences of using this framework with cognitively unimpaired adults from diverse backgrounds remains unknown. Furthermore, few studies exist on AD biomarkers in African Americans, despite the increased prevalence and incidence of AD in this population. There is a critical need to understand how adults traditionally under-represented in research, such as African Americans, perceive AD biomarker-detected pathologic changes and to identify factors linked to positive (e.g., health-promoting behaviors that may reduce dementia risk) and negative (e.g., stigma and psychological distress) outcomes related to biomarker disclosure. In the absence of such knowledge, it will be difficult to develop ethical and culturally-sensitive biomarker disclosure approaches that minimize risk for negative psychological consequences. This gap, if left unaddressed, may contribute to continued difficulty recruiting and retaining African Americans into biomarker research, affecting the generalizability of those studies. The objective of this proposal is to identify personal/demographic, experiential, and AD-specific factors associated with willingness to enroll in biomarker research and subsequent likelihood for negative and positive outcomes related to disclosure. Results will be used to inform a future R01 application focused on developing and implementing ethical approaches for communicating biomarker information to a diverse population in a manner that minimizes stigma and psychological distress, empowers individuals to engage in health-promoting behaviors, and encourages enrollment and retention in AD-related research and clinical trials. This study proposes to conduct telephone-based surveys with cognitively unimpaired African Americans (n=150) and whites (n=150) enrolled in two longitudinal cohort studies, the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Our specific aims are to (1) identify factors that predict willingness to enroll in research measuring and disclosing AD biomarker data and (2) identify factors linked to negative and positive outcomes related to biomarker disclosure. Upon completion of these aims, our expected outcomes are to have identified factors associated with the decision to seek or avoid personal biomarker-disclosing research and the likelihood to experience negative or positive outcomes. This in turn is targeted to provide greater inclusivity of African Americans and other marginalized groups to participate in AD biomarker research. Research shifting the diagnosis and treatment of AD to biological markers without inclusion of these groups risks continued racial disparities in AD research, resulting in lower effectiveness in developing AD therapies that successfully generalize to the whole population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the push towards a biomarker-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be identified prior to symptoms, few studies exist on neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD in African Americans or on the psychological consequences of providing biomarker information to cognitively unimpaired adults. Research shifting the diagnosis of AD and treatment to genetic and biological markers without inclusion of these groups risks continued racial disparities in AD research, resulting in lower effectiveness in developing AD therapies that successfully generalize to the whole population.

"Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment among Mexican Americans PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this research is to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI): (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early detection and treatment. AD is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia and the 5th leading cause of death for those over 65 (8th leading cause of death for U.S. Hispanics). AD has an annual health care cost that is greater than that of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. While death rates from CVD and cancer have declined in recent decades, death rates have steadily increased for AD. The Mexican American elderly population is among the fastest growing segments of the population; however, little research on MCI and AD has been conducted among this underserved group. Here we will leverage our ongoing Health & Aging Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE) study to identify different pathways for MCI and AD among Mexican Americans, define subtle neuroanatomical and blood-based biomarker changes that are related to future risk of MCI and AD as well as provide evidence to support the utility of our AD blood-based detection tool that can be implemented in primary care settings. The current research team consists of leading experts in Mexican American cognitive aging, the epidemiology of MCI and AD as well as biomarkers of MCI and AD (neuroimaging and blood-based). The project will leverage a substantial existing infrastructure and HABLE cohort to address the two health disparities outlined above through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 - Examine the impact of higher rates of metabolic burden and depressive symptomatology on MCI and AD among community-dwelling Mexican Americans; Specific Aim 2 - Examine neuroimaging and blood-based biomarkers associated with MCI and AD among Mexican Americans; and Specific Aim 3: Validate our blood-based AD screening tool as the first-step in a multi-stage diagnostic process among Mexican Americans. The current project will address significant health disparities faced by Mexican American elders suffering from and at risk for MCI and AD. The identification of novel pathways related to disproportionate burden of diabetes and depression can lead to novel ethnic-specific interventions. The identification of a blood-based screening tool for AD will provide primary care providers a way of meeting the needs of a rapidly growing elderly Mexican American population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly growing number of patients suffering from Alzheimer's (AD), little work has been conducted on AD among Mexican Americans. Here we propose to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from AD (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early diagnosis methods. The relevance of this project is the identification of potentially different pathways to AD among Mexican Americans (directly related to increased rates of diabetes and depression and the health disparity of earlier age of onset) as well as the provision of a blood-based screening tool for AD that can be implemented in primary care clinics.",Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild

"Community-based approach to Early Identification of transitions to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in African Americans With the rapid increase in longevity and considerable expansion of the share of elderly in the population, it is becoming ever important to understand the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive declines in order to guide environmental and clinical interventions for older adults and for more accurate prediction of risk for dementia [e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD)]. A crucial challenge of aging research is improving understanding of the neurobiological basis of conditions leading to dementia, in order to refine the diagnostic procedures and to target new behavioral and pharmacological interventions. A main avenue for the neurobiological understanding of very early risk processes leading to dementia would be the screening of large populations at risk by means of quick, low-cost, and widely available procedures. The present proposal will test to what extent computerized cognitive tests and portable electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to easily, accurately and efficiently evaluate early cognitive decline in elderly at risk for developing AD.  Health disparities represent a critical roadblock mitigating the social and fiscal benefits of early identification and care, not only to the individual patient and family, but also at the state and federal levels. Community-dwelling, African-American elders show faster rates of cognitive decline and are almost twice as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD as are older, white Americans. However, they are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment in the early stages of these disorders. Development of economically viable and culturally acceptable methods of early detection is critical in minority populations.  We propose to identify the first signs of dementia in at risk African Americans with subjective memory complaints (SMC) in their communities within the Detroit metro area by using computerized cognitive tests CogState and NIH Toolbox and a portable EEG. We plan to combine cross-sectional with longitudinal studies: within the first two years, we will cognitively evaluate a total of 500 at risk African Americans with SMC. From these participants we will select 200 who at entry to the longitudinal study will not be diagnosed with either dementia or MCI but will, however, undergo repeated cognitive and EEG testing every 6 months over a 3 year period. We will compare these approaches of repeated cognitive and EEG/ Event-Related Potentials (ERP) testing in terms of their sensitivity of identifying persons already at risk who will progress to MCI and/or AD.  Our proposed community based evaluation that combines behavioral and EEG/ERP methods will be used to generate profiles of at risk healthy elderly African-Americans, who may within a short period of time develop MCI or AD. We expect that with the combination of behavioral and EEG/ERP methods, we will be able to develop objective markers, which will reliably identify early signs of cognitive decline. Such markers will be used for identification of significant cognitive decline, and to evaluate efficiency of new pharmacological approaches, which will lead to the development of new therapeutic interventions and disease modification. Narrative Community dwelling African American elders have faster rates of cognitive decline and are almost twice as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than are older white Americans, but are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment in the early stages of these disorders. Development of reasonable, economically viable, and culturally acceptable methods of early detection are thus critical in minority populations. The proposed experiments (e.g., use of computerized cognitive testing and portable electrophysiology) are intended to better characterize at risk African Americans and to develop new markers for detection of the earliest cognitive changes in healthy elders who may be at risk for the development of MCI or who may go on to develop AD.",Community-based approach to Early Identification of

"OLFACTORY IMPAIRMENT IN OFFSPRING STUDY OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE We plan to test the 12-item BSIT, a short, standardized, cross-culturally validated subset of the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), in an add-on study to the recently funded project “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease” (RF1 AG054070). Middle-aged offspring (age 40-64) of parents who participated in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) are being studied with clinical and neuropsychological evaluation (n=3,000), high-resolution structural MRI (n=1,000), and Aβ PET (n=150). In the years 2004-2010, over one-third (n=1,369) of the intensively studied parent cohort had odor identification testing with the full 40-item UPSIT.  Odor identification impairment distinguishes dementia from cognitively intact controls, predicts transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, and predicts cognitive decline in older adults without dementia better than episodic verbal memory deficits. Further, odor identification impairment has been associated with increased mortality even after controlling for dementia and medical comorbidity in older adults, and in this offspring study, mortality will become an important outcome if longitudinal follow-up is instituted eventually. In the proposed cross-sectional study, we hypothesize that in the cohort of 3,000 offspring, lower BSIT scores (impaired odor identification) will be associated with increased age and the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele, and correlate with impaired cognitive ability in Whites (increased incipient AD pathology) to a greater extent than in African Americans or Hispanics (increased incipient cerebrovascular pathology). In the 1,000 offspring that get MRI brain scans, we expect that lower BSIT scores will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and cortical thinning in Whites but not African Americans or Hispanics. In the 150 offspring that get amyloid PET scans, lower BSIT scores are anticipated to be associated with greater amyloid uptake among Whites, but not among African Americans or Hispanics. We will also evaluate BSIT in the offspring in relation to parental BSIT performance and risk of AD in the parents. We have begun pilot work in administering the BSIT to the first 300 offspring being studied, and expect to be able to assess all study participants with the BSIT, without loss of any BSIT data, if this proposal is funded. Our overarching goal is to identify priority biological or social factors for intervention during the preclinical stage of AD, and determine whether strategies to prevent AD should differ across race/ethnicity. Adding odor identification testing furthers these goals in the existing project and allows for the testing of specific hypotheses that will enhance our understanding of the associations and potential utility of this inexpensive early biomarker of AD.   Based on the knowledge that impairment in odor identification predicts both cognitive decline and the transition from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults, we plan to test the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) in 3,000 offspring as an add-on study to the recently funded project “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease” (RF1 AG054070). Middle-aged offspring (age 40-64) of parents who participated in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) are being studied with clinical and neuropsychological evaluation (n=3,000), high-resolution structural MRI (n=1,000), and amyloid PET imaging (n=150).

"Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) aims to foster and enhance innovative research in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) with the long term goals to 1) advance ADRD-relevant social and behavioral science research in underserved and underrepresented communities while; 2) diversify the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging. This center will build on the existing deep infrastructure and research strengths in dementia and aging research at the University of Michigan (UM). The MCCFAD will emphasize research in three priority areas of: epidemiology, health economics, and culturally sensitive care. The rationale for these three areas is directly related to the current lack of a comprehensive understanding of the contextual complexities inherent in ADRD disparities, the need to enhance diversity in the professional research workforce addressing the brain and cognitive health of older adults, as well as dynamic changes in the demographic and multi-cultural composition of the U.S. population. The MCCFAD will promote diversifying the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging through collaborations with other NIA-sponsored Centers and programs and via connections with R1, R2 and R3 universities in Michigan. The Center will focus on the contexts in which ADRD is experienced. Knowledge concerning the contexts of ADRD is quite limited but has been shown to be critical for elucidating sociocultural, economic and behavioral contributors to and consequences of health disparities generally and ADRD disparities specifically. The Center's four Cores are: Administrative (AC), Research and Education (REC), Analytic (AnC), Community Liaison and Recruitment (CLRC) with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Advance ADRD-relevant disparities research in epidemiology, health economics, and culturally-sensitive care; Aim 2: Recruit and mentor 15 AD-RCMAR Scientists (RS) from the pilot-study investigator stage through professional publications and independent research applications and funding; Aim 3: Connect with African American, Arab American and Latino communities to broaden understanding of intra- and inter-cultural factors affecting participation in ADRD research. The Center profits from the groundbreaking, successful work of their extensive network of experienced mentors and experts. These resources, along with planned structure and activities will ensure that, upon receiving NIA designation as an AD-RCMAR, the MCCFAD will have a significant impact in diversifying the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging while enhancing research to better understand AD and related forms of dementia across various contexts. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) will focus on the social and behavioral dynamics in which Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are experienced. To address ADRD, one of the fastest growing health problems in the United States, the MCCFAD builds on longstanding strengths at the University of Michigan in 1) dementia research; 2) mentoring scientists from underrepresented backgrounds; 3) partnerships with Michigan NIA Centers; and 4) links to Michigan's two other major research universities, Michigan State University and Wayne State University.

"Native Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR) OVERALL ABSTRACT American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) are increasingly concerned about Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), as these conditions will have a major impact on their communities. Although AI/ANs and NHPIs are culturally diverse and dispersed throughout the US, they share a high prevalence of ADRD risk factors. In addition, life expectancies for AI/ANs and NHPIs have improved over the last 50 years by as much as 30 years, resulting in a tripling of their population share of people aged 65 and older. The confluence of perceived need, high risk, and limited data motivates us to propose a Native Alzheimer’s Disease-related Resource Center in Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR). Our research team offers unique scientific resources and opportunities as well as an extensive network of academic and community partnerships. Based at Washington State University (WSU), with collaborators at Stanford University and the University of Colorado, we will create an innovative program to understand, intervene on, and mitigate the ADRD-related health disparities experienced by AI/ANs and NHPIs. The Center’s theme will emphasize AI/AN and NHPI health disparities and aging from the individual to the population level. Our Research Education Component will fund meritorious Pilot Studies led by early-career investigators known as RCMAR Scientists. RCMAR Scientists will receive mentorship and training in methods, measurements, and study designs that meet high scientific standards and are culturally appropriate. They also will be mentored in the development of successful funding proposals so that they can pursue independent careers in ADRD research. Notably, 13 professionals who are either AI/AN or NHPI will participate as Co-Investigators, Consultants, or RCMAR Scientists. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Build infrastructure, assemble resources, and provide scientific expertise to enhance the diversity of the aging research workforce by mentoring promising junior and mid-level underrepresented minority scientists for sustained careers in ADRD research, focusing on AI/AN and NHPI populations; 2) Recruit RCMAR Scientists, especially those of AI/AN, NHPI, and other URM backgrounds, to conduct Pilot Studies in the social, behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical sciences on ADRD, and use these Pilot Studies as a vehicle for delivering mentorship and career guidance; and 3)Promote advances in ADRD research and increase the number of independent underrepresented minority researchers, with an emphasis on AI/AN and NHPI health faculty, who can address the health and well-being of AI/AN and NHPI elders, health disparities, and aging from the individual to the societal level. NAD-RCMAR will also capitalize on the national network of Satellite Centers created by Drs. Buchwald and Manson and led by AI/AN researchers. These Satellite Centers will ensure that our efforts are national in scope, especially our recruitment of RCMAR Scientists, our identification of datasets relevant to ADRD in AI/ANs and NHPIs, and our dissemination of results. This work will help address NIA’s research priorities for ADRD among underrepresented minorities, as articulated in the 2012 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Our Center responds to NIA’s interest in diversifying the scientific workforce. OVERALL NARRATIVE We will launch an effort to describe, understand, intervene on, and mitigate the Alzheimer’s disease health disparities experienced by American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. We will achieve this goal by funding social and behavioral Pilot Studies that advance the field, emphasizing the recruitment and mentorship of Native junior and mid-level researchers. These trainees will receive training on methods and analyses so that their work meets high scientific standards, while being culturally appropriate. This work will advance Alzheimer’s disease research and increase the number of independent investigators focused on Alzheimer’s disease disparities experienced by our target populations.",Native Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR),9764239,P30AG059295,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Pathology ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Smoking ', ' Target Populations ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' executive coaching ', ' career counselor ', ' Vocational Counseling ', ' Occupational Guidance ', ' Career Guidance ', ' Career Counseling ', ' Vocational Guidance ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Chippewa ', ' Ojibwa ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' professor ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' Department chair ', ' distinguished professor ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' minority scientist ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,P30,2019,610025,0.01734239255460873
"Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center ABSTRACT - OVERVIEW The overall goal of the proposed renewal of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (Rush ADCC) is to continue to support the performance of cutting edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of MCI, AD, and other common dementias, by providing researchers with a stimulating multi-disciplinary environment, and unique and highly valued clinical and post-mortem data, and ante- and post-mortem biologic specimens. The Rush ADCC has been in continuous operation since 1991. It has eight Cores carefully designed to support a variety of timely and important areas of research including studies: 1) of the transition from normal aging to MCI and to the earliest stages of dementia with substantial participation by racial and ethnic minorities, 2) linking risk factors to normal aging, incident MCI and incident AD, and to post-mortem indices of AD and mixed pathologies, 3) that incorporate contemporary high throughput biochemical and molecular data into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, and 4) that link neuroimaging and biofluid biomarkers to contemporary biochemical and molecular data, 5) that support drug discovery pipelines, and 6) that support studies of impaired motor function. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADCC as a whole. The Clinical Core will collect UDS and additional data on Blacks without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Religious Orders Study (ROS) Core will follow older members of Catholic religious communities who have agreed to annual evaluation and brain donation at death. The Latino Core will collect the same data as in ROS on older Latinos without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Neuropathology Core will process, store, evaluate and distribute biospecimens obtained by the Clinical, ROS, and Latino Cores. The Outreach and Recruitment Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities into the Clinical and Latino Cores, and other NIA funded initiatives. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to provide the infrastructure that allows all other Cores to be maximally successful and impactful, and will provide statistical support to users of ADCC resources especially junior investigators and trainees. The new Research and Education Component will provide a structured program of mentorship across the ADCC, Rush University of the Rush ADCC strategic partners. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERVIEW The prevention of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia is a major public health priority. The proposed continuation of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center will generate resources that are being used to support a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of MCI and dementia, and to identify novel therapeutic targets for its treatment and prevention.",Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center,9751687,P30AG010161,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clergy ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Proteomics ', ' neuropathology ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' epigenomics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' normal aging ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' relational database ', ' operation ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', "" Alzheimer's Disease Core Center "", ' collaborative environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' education research ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P30,2019,4296090,0.14897909184260155
"Longitudinal Biological Pathways Leading to Alzheimer's Disease Health Disparities in Blacks PROJECT SUMMARY Blacks are more than twice as likely to develop dementia than Whites. However, controlling for many of the factors that put Blacks at greater risk, such as having less education and lower occupational status, does not eliminate these health disparities. Therefore, other race-related factors underlie the increased risk for dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). One possibility is that multiple levels of chronic stress found uniquely in Blacks, exacerbate these health disparities. As outlined by the NIA's Health Disparities Research Framework, these stressors stem from environmental factors such as residential segregation, sociocultural factors such as racism, and behavioral factors such as one's perceived control. It is clear that these types of stressors negatively impact mental health, but a large gap exists between a) these generalized stressors, b) neurobiological pathways, and c) a diagnosis of AD in Blacks. Because AD is a brain disease, this knowledge gap can be illuminated by understanding the biological progression from “normal” to AD in Blacks. According to the neurotoxicity hypothesis, prolonged exposure to stress increases the brain's vulnerability to pathological toxins and reduces the brain's ability to resist subtle brain damage. Thus, unique race-related stressors might lead to a brain environment that is more vulnerable to AD pathology (beta-amyloid and tau) and accelerates declines in brain structure and the associated cognitive declines that lead to AD in Blacks compared with Whites. By harmonizing data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and the Minority Aging Research Study, secondary analyses will be conducted to analyze the biological pathways that create and sustain race-related health disparities in AD. We will use multi-level model regression techniques to test the extent that 1) rates of longitudinal declines in cortical thickness will be associated with greater cognitive decline in Blacks than Whites and 2) rates of longitudinal declines in hippocampal volumes and a novel measure of hippocampal complexity will be associated with greater cognitive decline in Blacks than Whites. Addressing whether Blacks are more vulnerable to longitudinal cognitive decline through different neurodegenerative pathways than Whites would lead to a theoretical framework that would provide testable hypotheses of causes of these potential vulnerabilities (like racial stressors). PROJECT NARRATIVE We will examine the biological pathways that lead to a two- to four-fold increase in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in Blacks compared with Whites. This health disparity is a critical public health concern because the impact on healthcare resources and personal income currently is and will continue to be an enormous burden on society (an estimated $214 billion), especially in Blacks, who are the least likely to seek out early medical help, receive adequate treatment, and can afford such treatments. We anticipate that the study would allow us to define brain vulnerabilities within Blacks that could lead to future interventions that target those brain pathways with real promise to delay the onset of AD, which would in turn reduce the number of AD cases and costs of treatment significantly.",Longitudinal Biological Pathways Leading to Alzheimer's Disease Health Disparities in

"PLAN: Dementia Literacy Education and Navigation for Korean Elders with Probable Dementia and their Caregivers Despite a higher prevalence of dementia, ethnic minority elders in the U.S. are underdiagnosed and at greater risk of not receiving appropriate care than their white counterparts. Early detection of dementia allows for a transition to early dementia care for community-dwelling elderly that may delay or slow deterioration of cognitive functions and functional disabilities and enable families to adequately plan for the potential challenges of dementia caregiving. Currently, little is known about how to effectively identify undiagnosed individuals with probable dementia in community-based settings that serve diverse racial and ethnic minorities and how to transition them into the health care system for necessary diagnostic follow-up and care for dementia. This proposed research addresses the critical gaps by focusing on dementia assessments and follow-up in one of the fastest-growing ethnic minority populations—Korean Americans (KAs). Our collaborative, interdisciplinary research team has more than 10 years of community-based, participatory research experience in the KA community and has laid the groundwork for the current application. In particular, we have conducted the first community-based epidemiological study which estimated the prevalence of dementia among KA elders. Moreover, we successfully trained bilingual community health workers (CHWs) and obtained evidence to support the feasibility and efficacy of using CHWs to assess dementia in community- residing Korean elders and promote linkage to medical service for dementia among KA elders with probable dementia while improving caregiver psychological outcomes. To this end, the goals of our study are to identify community-residing Korean elderly with probable dementia and to test the effects of dementia literacy training and navigation assistance by CHWs to transition affected Korean elders and their caregivers into the healthcare system for adequate diagnostic follow-up and care. CHWs have been used to eliminate health disparities in resource-poor communities with positive outcomes. The adoption of trained CHWs for cognitive health is a new strategic approach which could be highly applicable to many linguistic and/or socially-isolated racial/ethnic minority communities with limited resources. Early detection of dementia allows for a transition to early dementia care that may delay or slow deterioration of cognitive functions and functional disabilities and enable families to adequately plan for the potential challenges of dementia caregiving. Currently, little is known about how to effectively evaluate and screen undiagnosed individuals with probable dementia in community-based settings that serve diverse racial/ethnic minorities and how to transition them into the healthcare system for necessary diagnostic follow-up and care for dementia. Using Korean Americans as an example, we propose to test trained community health workers as an effective and sustainable approach for early detection of dementia and care in racial/ethnic minority

"Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY  The Cleveland Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (CADRC) is a collaborative effort amongst physicians and investigators from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), Cleveland Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada sites, the Metro Health System (MHS), University Hospitals (UH), and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center (LSVA), to establish a National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded Alzheimer’s disease research center. The CADRC would represent a rich clinical and research community and an estimated 45,000 Nevadans and 220,000 Ohioans who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Currently there is no Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in either Ohio or Nevada.  The CADRC will bring together the considerable expertise from the medical and academic communities in northeast Ohio and Nevada to focus on one of the largest health care crises facing our country. The CADRC will be focused on the increasingly recognized clinical and pathologic heterogeneity observed in AD and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD).  The CADRC will create an infrastructure to help speed up the research efforts of local, national and international investigators. The CADRC will participate in the national Alzheimer’s Centers program and contribute to the “big science” possible when centers from around the country collaborate. We will recruit subject samples that northeast Ohio and Nevada are well situated to study due to unique regional populations or studies (dementia with Lewy bodies, repetitive head trauma, and rapidly progressive AD identified by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center,) or relevant to our understanding of AD and related dementias (cognitively normal older individuals, AD and mild cognitive impairment). We will add value to the evaluation of these subject samples by adding biofluid collection and analysis and cutting edge imaging. Special emphasis will also be placed on enrollment of minority populations not often well-studied.  We are quite encouraged by the collaborative spirit already demonstrated by those participating in the CADRC planning from CWRU, CCF, MHS, UH, and LSVA and from the support we have received from the northeast Ohio and Las Vegas communities. We believe this is a great opportunity for both Ohio and Nevada to contribute to the greater efforts of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers program and to improve the treatments for these devastating disorders.

"Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans Although African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss— with double the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to white Americans—we do not sufficiently understand the causes of this health disparity, nor how to best focus future interventional efforts to remediate this health crisis among older African Americans. Stress, sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyles, poor cardiovascular fitness, depressive symptoms, high body mass, and low education are all known risk factors for cognitive decline and AD; their widespread presence among African Americans, particularly in low socioeconomic communities, suggests that some or all of these may be key to the high rates of dementia and Alzheimer's among African Americans. However, little is known about the relative importance (and interactions) among these different risk factors for AD in African Americans. Additionally, there is a dearth of data on the neural changes that occur across the lifespan in older African Americans-- especially those at highest risk for AD-- and how these relate to behavioral and lifestyle risk factors for AD.  This revised R01 resubmission—including four months of pilot data from our R56 bridge award and retitled “Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans”—will address the aforementioned gaps in understanding minority health disparities in Alzheimer's disease. We will test 360 African Americans, ages 65-85, on a battery of neuropsychological, cognitive, health, fitness, genetic, and lifestyle assessments. Our sample includes 240 newly recruited participants as well as 120 legacy participants recruited during the current R56 grant. Half (180) will receive brain imaging using MRI, addressing the paucity of available neuroimaging data on older African Americans. Two aspects of our plans are especially innovative and significant to project success.  First, we address barriers to African-American research participation and retention through our ten-year history of partnership, cooperation, and trust with the African-American communities of Greater Newark through Rutgers University-Newark's African American Brain Health Initiative: A University-Community Partnership (www.brainhealth.rutgers.edu). Our long-term relationships with community-based organizations have been critical to our past successes and involve year-round programs for community outreach, education, and engagement that bolster our research recruitment and retention. Many of these efforts are funded through a five-year grant to the PI from the NJ Department of Health's Office of Minority and Multicultural Health.  Second, we address the need for evaluating and validating novel cognitive assessments that are sensitive to the earliest stages of prodromal Alzheimer's disease by having all participants complete the Rutgers Generalization Tasks, innovative cognitive assessments developed by the Co-I (Myers) and PI (Gluck). These tasks are derived from prior neurocomputational models of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus, brain regions disrupted in the earliest stages of prodromal AD. As these tasks are based on non-verbal animal conditioning paradigms, they may be especially valuable for tracking cognitive changes in our population, which is affected by low levels of education or verbal fluency. We hypothesize that deficits in generalization—the ability to apply previously learned rules to novel task demands and new stimuli—will correlate with, and longitudinally predict, cognitive decline and neural changes in prodromal AD. Aim #1. CROSS-SECTIONAL BEHAVIORAL ANALYSES: We will evaluate (1) how variations in health, physical fitness and activity are correlated with cognitive function, and (2) how the influence of these variables is mediated by education, social support, and genetics, in modulating the risk of cognitive decline and AD in elderly African Americans.!Predictions: Low levels of physical activity and cardiovascular fitness and high body mass, will be correlated with poorer performance on the Rutgers Generalization Tasks. Aim #2. NEURAL MECHANISM ANALYSES: Using multimodal MRI to capture brain structure, function, and  white matter integrity, we evaluate how the relationships in Aim #1 are mediated by neural mechanisms.  Predictions: Poorer generalization performance (and low levels of physical activity and fitness) will be associated with reduced hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortical thickness, intra-hippocampal and EC- hippocampal connectivity, and decreased FA and increased MD in the hippocampus and EC. Aim #3. LONGITUDINAL PREDICTIVE ANALYSES: To identify longitudinal aspects of the relationships  described in Aim #1 and Aim #2, along with predictors of future cognitive decline and progression to aMCI  and AD, we will test all participants at baseline and every two years thereafter (providing us data from three  time-points for the legacy R56 cohort, and two time-points for the newly recruited participants).  Predictions: Participants who progress to aMCI or AD will show early impairments on the generalization  tasks (correlated with neurodegeneration) prior to deficits in standardized memory assessments, as well as  being more likely to have a history of lower physical activity and poorer cardiovascular fitness. The proposed R01, building on our ongoing R56 data collection, will overcome current limitations to understanding the high rate of cognitive decline and AD in older African Americans, while providing further clinical and neuroimaging validation of innovative cognitive assessments, the Rutgers Generalization Tasks, which may prove useful for detecting and measuring cognitive changes in early prodromal AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE With this resubmission of R01 AG053961-01, now retitled “Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans,” the African-American Brain Health Initiative (AABHI) at Rutgers University-Newark seeks to investigate (1) the relative contributions of different modifiable health and lifestyle factors to age-related cognitive decline in African Americans, (2) the neural processes mediating these contributions, and, (3) identify early predictors of cognitive decline and conversion to aMCI and AD, and understand how the health and lifestyle behaviors influence risk for subsequent cognitive decline. Although African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss—with double the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to white Americans—we do not sufficiently understand the causes of this health disparity, nor how to best focus future interventional efforts to remediate this health crisis among older African Americans. Stress, sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyles, poor cardiovascular fitness, depressive symptoms, high body mass, and low education are all known risk factors for cognitive decline and AD; their widespread presence among African Americans, particularly in low socioeconomic communities, suggests that some or all of these may be key to the high rates of dementia and Alzheimer's among African Americans. However, little is known about the relative importance (and interactions) among these different risk factors for AD in African Americans. Additionally, there is a dearth of data on the neural changes that occur across the lifespan in older African Americans-- especially those at highest risk for AD-- and how these relate to behavioral and lifestyle risk factors for AD. Our study attempts to resolve this issue by examining the cognitive, neural, and lifestyle factors associated with cognitive resilience and, conversely, those that predict early cognitive decline in older African Americans.",Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans,9697716,R01AG053961,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Physical Fitness ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sleep loss ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep debt ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' deficient sleep ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' base ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physical activity ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Stimulus ', ' Trust ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Genetic ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Howard Temin Award ', ' Bridging Award ', ' Cognitive ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' Minority ', ' conditioning ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' community partnership ', ' brain health ', ' recruit ', ' cardiovascular fitness ', ' ']",NIA,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R01,2019,689808,0.18855501389307366
"Are there ethnic differences in brain amyloid and tau in the seventh decade of life? Our goal is to examine whether ethnic and racial differences in brain amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, the major neuropathology components of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), explain reported ethnic disparities in dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT) in Northern Manhattan We will examine ethnic differences in brain Aβ and tau, ascertained in-vivo with positron emission tomography (PET), among Hispanics, Non-Hispanic Blacks (Blacks), and Non-Hispanic Whites (Whites) aged 60 to 69 years from Northern Manhattan. We will also explore whether ethnic differences in brain Aβ and tau explain ethnic differences in memory performance, the earliest clinical marker of AD; whether ethnicity modifies the relation of APOE-ε4 and brain Aβ; whether ethnic disparities in literacy and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) moderate the association of brain Aβ and tau with memory performance. Lastly, we will explore whether the higher risk of DAT attributable to hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes) among Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites is explained by higher brain Aβ and tau. The risk of DAT is higher in elderly Blacks and Hispanics in Northern Manhattan compared with Whites. It is unknown whether this disparity is due to differences in AD neuropathology, CVD, CVD risk factors, or social determinants of health (SDOH). There is a paucity of studies of AD biomarkers in Blacks and Hispanics to answer this question, particularly in late middle age. We propose to address these gaps in knowledge taking advantage of an ongoing funded study of Aβ and tau PET (1R01AG050440, 3R01AG050440-02S1;09/01/15-05/31/20) in 100 Hispanics between 60 and 69 years of age at the time of brain imaging, a critical period for accumulation of AD neuropathology. We propose to extend this funded project to 100 Blacks and Whites aged 60 to 69 years from the same community in order to compare brain Aβ, tau, CVD, and cognition among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites in this understudied age group. We will ascertain brain Aβ using 18F-Florbetaben PET, and tau using 18F- THK-5351 PET at 2 time points 24 months apart. We will also conduct brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for co-registration of PET and for ascertainment of CVD (white matter hyperintensities and infarcts). Our primary aim is to examine whether there are ethnic differences in the presence of whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites aged 60 to 69 years from the community of Northern Manhattan. We will also explore across and within ethnic groups the association of whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, with memory performance, and moderation of this association by CVD and literacy. Secondary aim 1 is to compare the association of APOE-ε4 with whole brain fibrillar Aβ and tau across ethnic groups cross sectionally and longitudinally. Secondary aim 2 is to explore if ethnic disparities in hyperglycemia explain ethnic differences in whole brain fibrillar Aβ, and tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex and memory impairment. We address the following objectives stated in in PAR-15-349: “Neuroimaging, neuropathology and the biology of AD”, “Analyses of pathways that create and sustain AD disparities”, and “Effect of Educational Attainment on Dementia Risk”. Our project is in line with the goals of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) by providing information that may explain the high burden of AD manifestations among Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites, and will addresses the paucity of AD biomarker data in the paucity of AD biomarker data in the seventh decade of life and in ethnic minorities.",Are there ethnic differences in brain

"Risk factors for MCI and Dementia in a Diverse Senior Cohort ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Risk factors for MCI and dementia in a diverse senior cohort. Community-based research on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia includes relatively few longitudinal studies that include low-income minority seniors. PAR 15-356 specifically welcomes projects that propose augmenting existing longitudinal cohort studies, enhancing the power of multi- ethnic cohort studies, and exploring trends in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose to use intensive community-based outreach to recruit 800 seniors from a low-SES group of boroughs whose population is 60% African American (AA). These boroughs, comprising the 15104 ZIP code, are within the study area of MYHAT (R01AG023651), an ongoing population- based cohort study of cognitive impairment and dementia in 2000+ randomly selected seniors in southwestern PA. By using the MYHAT assessment protocol in the proposed new 15104 volunteer cohort, we will collect identical data and cost-effectively leverage the MYHAT data by pooling the two cohorts for analysis. Using appropriate sampling weights to adjust our estimates for non-random sample selection of the 15104 cohort, we will examine risk and resilience factors within the pooled cohort. We will identify factors associated with MCI at baseline, and, through annual follow-up assessments, identify risk factors for subsequent cognitive decline and dementia. Particularly, but not exclusively, we will focus on risk factors common among AA seniors: low education, poor educational quality, low health literacy, APOE*4 genotype, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. We will then determine whether race modifies the relationship between risk factors and adverse cognitive outcomes. Enhancing the participation of minority seniors will allow us to take a critical first step towards addressing the challenges of investigating, and eventually addressing, cognitive health disparities in the population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Between 2006 and 2008, we assembled a community-based cohort of over 2,000 adults, aged  65+ years, by randomly selecting individuals from the Voter Registration lists for a group  of small towns municipalities in a Rust Belt area of southwestern Pennsylvania . The study  is called the Monongahela- Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT). We now propose to use intensive community outreach within 3 towns in the same area, with  enthusiastic support from the town Mayors, to recruit a sample of 800 volunteers who are  60% African Americans. We will work with community leaders to inform seniors in these  towns about the MYHAT study and encourage their participation. Using appropriate  statistical weighting methods, we will combine the new sample with the MYHAT sample. The knowledge generated will inform clinical and public health strategies for prevention of  cognitive decline and dementia in older minority adults, and potentially influence health  policy and planning.",Risk factors for MCI and Dementia in a Diverse Senior Cohort,9747777,R01AG058549,"['Abbreviations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' plan health ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Leadership ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Smoking ', ' Stable Populations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' APOE\xa0e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Out-Migrations ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' spelling ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Municipalities ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Glossary ', ' outreach ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' trend ', ' systematic review ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' volunteer ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' healthy aging ', ' population based ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Minority Participation ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,759753,0.13068898525046677
"Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive reserve refers to the ability to buffer against brain pathology, including types commonly found post mortem in the brains of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). I hypothesize that reserve is a key reason why some older adults have normal cognitive function despite the presence of neuropathology. Recently, researchers have begun to empirically investigate reserve as the discrepancy between neuropathology and brain function, as measured with cognitive tests. Studies have found a relationship between a disadvantaged early life environment and later life clinical dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. However, it is not known if an advantaged early life is related to greater later life reserve or lower levels of neuropathology itself. As brain development is particularly accelerated through age 5 years, early life could be a sensitive period for cognitive reserve. I propose to use four unique datasets that contain information on early life social environment, later life cognitive tests, and autopsy-based neuropathology measures from geographically diverse study populations: the Adult Changes in Thought Study, the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, the Religious Orders Study, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. I test the hypotheses that an advantaged early life environment, independently of and synergistically with adult social advantage, is related to greater later life cognitive reserve, even in the presence of significant neuropathology. I will be able to test also whether early life environment is related to actual levels of cognition and neuropathology. My background in demography and epidemiology, including 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow and 5 years as a junior faculty member, prepares me to lead these projects, under the guidance of a team that reflects the leadership of the proposed studies, local experts in neuropathology and epidemiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, a local expert in the analysis of cognitive measures, and a leading expert in the integration of social and life course epidemiology. The proposed training and research experiences in this project will be integral in building a foundation in the analysis of cognitive outcomes and resilience to dementia, and enhancing the experience of my existing skills in life course and aging epidemiology that will allow me to lead future projects at the intersection of these fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project identifies whether an advantaged early social environment increases one's later life cognitive reserve, that is, the ability to buffer from pathology. I measure an advantaged early social environment primarily through early life family socioeconomic position and height and also test to what extent an advantaged adult social environment explains this relationship, versus the link from early life to later life cognitive reserve.","Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve",9722982,K01AG050723,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Asia ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Baltimore ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Buffers ', ' Clergy ', ' Cognition ', ' Demography ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Illinois ', ' Japanese American ', ' Knee ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Experience ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' Memory ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' nutritional care ', ' Head circumference ', ' news ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Height ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social inequality ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' early life exposure ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' study population ', ' Life course epidemiology ', ' Lifecourse epidemiology ', ' preservation ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2019,119371,0.11199385342020583
"Marital Biography and Risk of Dementia in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  With the rapid aging of the U.S. population, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias have emerged as a serious public health problem. Identifying the risk/protective factors of dementia is crucial in designing evidence-based interventions to reduce dementia risk in late life. Marital relationships have long been recognized as one of the most important social relationships that affect individuals’ well-being throughout adulthood. However, little is known about whether and how marital relationships are related to dementia risk in late life. This study is designed to enrich our understanding of how marital biography influences the risk of dementia among adults ages 65 years and older in the United States. Guided by the life course perspective, the project has three specific aims. AIM 1. Examine the associations between marital biography components and risk of dementia in late life. We will examine whether and to what extent major components of marital biography influence dementia risk over the 18-year period in the United States. We hypothesize that marital instability and longer duration in unmarried states are associated with a higher risk of dementia. AIM 2: Identify the mechanisms linking marital biography and the risk of dementia in late life. We will test four potential mechanisms that could explain the associations between components of marital biography and the risk of dementia: 1) economic resources (e.g., income, wealth, and access to health care), 2) psychosocial factors (e.g., social integration and depression), 3) biomedical (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke), and 4) health behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking, and exercise). We hypothesize that the combination of these four factors will account for a significant proportion of the differences in dementia risk among people with different marital biographies. Aim 3: Examine sex and race differences in the associations and mechanisms discussed in Aims 1 and 2. Data will be drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2016). Discrete-time hazard models will be applied to predict dementia risk. The proposed project will provide the first in- depth and systematic analysis of how marital biography influences the risk of dementia in late life.

"Social-biological dimensions of ADRD risk and resilience in a Native American cohort PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This expansion of the Stress and Resilience in Dementia (STRIDE) study explores modifiable social-biological pathways associated with cognitive and brain-based Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) markers in a cohort of middle-aged and older members of a Midwestern tribal community. Incidence and prevalence of ADRD are rising across sociodemographic strata, but social disadvantage exacerbates risk and strong evidence suggests that African Americans and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations bear particularly high ADRD burden. Social and racial disparities in cognitive aging are clearly multifactorial but are currently underexplained. Intersecting disadvantage markers including race, geography, and socioeconomic status correlate with chronic exposure to stressors that can provoke neuroendocrine and vascular dysfunction and the premature onset of morbidity and age-related declines. However, AI/AN communities remain severely underrepresented in cognitive aging research, and “weathering” processes that plausibly link socioenvironmental adversity to ADRD-associated brain and cognitive changes have not been explored. Social resources that promote resilience are also unknown. The long-term goal of this STRIDE project is to elucidate mechanisms by which social disadvantage contributes to ADRD risk in an underserved AI/AN community, and to pinpoint community-specific individual, social, and structural resources that mitigate that risk. The short-term objective of this pilot study is to identify social and biological factors associated with ADRD markers in a cohort of AI/AN community members, and establish preliminary methods and data that will facilitate future resilience-focused research. STRIDE builds on a partnership between the tribal Commission on Aging and the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), and leverages rich existing cognitive and biomarker data available through the ADRC. The collection of multidimensional stress data including both self-reported burden and a validated index of physiological weathering allow for preliminarily modeling the influence of life-spanning stressors and resources on population-relevant ADRD markers. Aim 1: In a group of 80 AI/AN participants, examine relationships between social/physiological stress indices and markers of ADRD risk including (i) cognitive decline and (ii) in sub-set of AI/AN participants, key ADRD biomarkers such as ?-amyloid42. Aim 2 (Exploratory): Characterize self-reported social resources salient to AI/AN populations and examine (i) relationships with ADRD markers and (ii) modification of relationships in Aim 1 by relevant resources. Impact: Achieving STRIDE pilot aims will establish methods and early data on community-specific social determinants of cognitive health, and identify stress-linked biological mediators that can serve as proximal outcomes in future risk reduction studies.  In so doing, STRIDE contributes to a growing body of research that seeks to recognize, understand, and reduce the growing ADRD crisis facing AI/AN communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it explores modifiable mechanisms contributing to dementia risk in American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), who are disproportionately impacted by the disease. The project integrates social and physiological data that are salient for a large Midwestern tribe with comprehensive cognitive and biomarker characterization to map novel pathways linking life-spanning social contexts to cognitive aging processes. Our long-term goal is to pinpoint social and structural resources that can mitigate socially-rooted dementia burden in AI/AN communities – the short-term objective is to establish preliminary methods, measures, and data that further that goal.",Social-biological dimensions of ADRD risk and resilience in a Native American cohort,9738280,R03AG063303,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Buffers ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A non-pharmacological intervention for patients with Alzheimer s disease and family caregivers Abstract An increasing number of adults in the U.S. provide care to someone aged 50+ years with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alzheimer's disease is a devastating illness affecting patients, family members and society. There is a need to identify interventions that decrease the cognitive and functional manifestations of the condition in the patient and the negative consequences experienced by family caregivers. Evidence suggests that non- pharmacological intervention approaches can be beneficial to both caregivers and AD patients. However, most intervention programs have exclusively focused on the caregiver or the patient, despite emerging evidence of a reciprocal interaction between the dyad. Also, most caregiver programs have targeted caregivers of patients in the moderate to severe stages of the illness. In addition, cognitive interventions for individuals with AD have been dependent on facility based training approaches, which limit feasibility and cost effectiveness.  The proposed study will develop and test the efficacy and feasibility of a dyadic-based intervention program (DT), delivered through state-of-the art computer tablet technology. A novel feature of the investigation is its focus on both the caregiver and the recipient of care (person with AD) and the integration of an evidenced- based caregiver intervention and evidenced-based cognitive/functional training for the care recipient. The program will be tailored for the caregiver and emphasize issues important to caregivers, not only in the earlier stages of caregiving, but will also target issues across the caregiving trajectory to help prepare the caregiver for changes in their role. The cognitive/functional training will be targeted to the needs of the care recipient. The DT intervention will be 6 months in duration and compared to a control condition (CC) that combines standard a nutrition intervention for the caregiver and mental stimulation exercises for care recipient. Two hundred and forty Hispanic, African American and White/Caucasian dyads will be randomized to the DT intervention or CC condition. Measures at baseline and the 6 and 12-month follow-ups will include indices of care recipient cognitive and functional status, and caregiver outcomes such as; quality of life, distress, and caregiving efficacy. Information will also be gathered on ethnic differences in response to the intervention and estimates of cost effectiveness of the intervention. The DT intervention is highly innovative given the focus on a dyadic approach, the use of state-of-the-art technology for intervention delivery, a community-based and stage-model approach to intervention development, the inclusion of the caregiver as a therapy extender and cultural tailoring of the program. Narrative The proposed study is extremely relevant to public health concerns. The prevalence of individuals with AD and family caregivers is projected to increase in the upcoming decades. To address this pressing issue, the focus of the proposed study is to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of an innovative intervention program, delivered through state-of-the art computer tablet technology that targets both ethnically/culturally diverse family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD patients. The program augments an evidenced-based caregiver intervention with an evidenced-based cognitive/functional training intervention for the patient. The overall goals of the project are to improve the lives of family caregivers; the ability of caregivers to provide care to their loved ones; to improve the lives of individuals with AD; and to reduce disparities in access to needed services and support among caregiver and patient populations.",A non-pharmacological intervention for patients with Alzheimer s disease and family caregivers,9791146,R01AG054009,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Maintenance ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Training Technique ', ' Training Technics ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' cognitive training ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' loved ones ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' efficacy testing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,745798,0.10554868491582454
"Cognitive impairment in Mexican Americans: a population-based study Abstract Hispanic/Latinos will comprise more than 30% of the U.S. population by mid-century, and Mexican Americans account for the largest share of this growing segment of society. This proposal aims to use door-to-door surveillance in Nueces County, Texas, a non-immigrant, bi-ethnic community, to determine the prevalence and trajectory over time of cognitive impairment and dementia in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will elucidate the mechanisms that explain the hypothesized ethnic disparity in Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer-related dementias by evaluating the roles of vascular disease risk factors, educational attainment and socio-economic status among others. This research will also delve deeply into the differences in informal caregiving for Mexican American and non-Hispanic whites with cognitive impairment and dementia. Caregiver burden and mental and physical health of caregivers will be examined toward efforts to develop interventions that build resilience in caregivers. A novel ability of this population-based study is to examine community resources for both patients and caregivers, and how these provisions differ by ethnicity. Using a rigorous mixed methods approach we will identify the gap between available resources and needs for those with cognitive impairment and dementia. In this way we will be well positioned to propose ethnic-specific testable interventions that promote mental and physical health for those with cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as for those family members who provide the care. This research will therefore lead to improved well- being, autonomy and outcomes among those with cognitive impairment and dementia and their caregivers. The investigative team members have conducted research in this community for 20 years and are experts in Mexican American culture and health, cognitive impairment and dementia, epidemiologic methods, community needs assessment and health behavior research. As the Mexican American population continues its tremendous growth and aging it is vitally important to better understand the prevalence and outcomes of cognitive impairment and dementia in this population, and to rapidly develop interventions that address the burden of these common conditions in Mexican American adults, families, and communities. Project Narrative The Mexican American population in the U.S. is rapidly growing and aging.

"Resilience Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease The overall aim of this longitudinal study is to identify new, modifiable mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) among a multi-ethnic cohort of approximately 2,000 older adults. The incidence of AD is higher for African Americans and Hispanics, compared to non-Hispanic Whites, even after controlling for the “usual suspects” in disparities research: traditional socioeconomic indicators and vascular health. Persistent and unexplained disparities suggest two possibilities that have not been well-examined: (1) known AD risk factors exhibit differential impact across race/ethnicity and/or (2) yet unmeasured factors increase AD risk for minorities. Our research team has identified multiple factors that have stronger cognitive impact among older African Americans or Hispanics, including depressive symptoms and MRI markers of brain pathology. These variables, along with poor vascular health and lower education/income, may be less impactful among Whites because membership in a majority group is associated with social-environmental resources that promote resilience. In the current proposal, resilience is conceptualized as better-than-expected outcomes given level of AD risk factors or brain pathology. This study will examine how resources that differ across race/ethnicity in our cohort (e.g., perceived social status, quality of education, and the perception that life outcomes are controllable) promote resilience at multiple points in the AD pathogenic pathway using repeat MRI and cognitive assessments across three time points. Because racial/ethnic minorities face unique stressors (e.g., acculturative stress, racial discrimination), we will also test whether these experiences influence the progression of MRI markers of brain pathology, cognitive decline, and incident AD. Our overarching hypothesis is that AD disparities persist because racial/ethnic minorities have depleted resources to adapt to known AD risk factors and brain pathology and/or unique, yet unmeasured AD risk factors. Specific aims are to (1) identify risk factors relevant to minority populations and examine whether they predict advancing brain pathology, cognitive decline, and incident AD among African Americans or Hispanics, (2) determine which resources explain racial/ethnic differences in the impact of known AD risk factors on advancing brain pathology (i.e., brain resilience), and (3) determine which resources explain racial/ethnic differences in the impact of advancing brain pathology on cognitive decline and incident AD (i.e., cognitive resilience). The prevalence of AD and the societal burden associated with AD treatment and care are on the rise because the U.S. population is aging. The proportion of U.S. elders who are African American or Hispanic is also increasing. These groups are at higher risk for AD than similarly aged non-Hispanic Whites, even after traditional socioeconomic indicators and cardiovascular health are taken into account. It is therefore critical to identify other, modifiable factors that reduce AD risk and eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in AD.",Resilience Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease,9736427,R01AG054520,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' social ', ' response ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' regional atrophy ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,1213752,0.1744195925757889
"Life Course Process of Alzheimer's Disease: Sex Difference and Biosocial Mechanisms Abstract The proposed research addresses two fundamental problems in population research on the Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) sex disparities in cognitive decline with aging, and (2) interplay of social and biological pathways that generate and sustain AD disparities. Our proposal breaks new ground with an innovative life- course research design that conjoins prospective cohort data from five large-scale NIH population-based longitudinal studies that collectively cover the adult life span. We will conduct integrative data analysis in response to an increased demand for replicability of scientific findings across independent studies and make efficient use of extant resources in the pursuit of a cumulative science. We will apply novel statistical methods to model longitudinal sex differences in age trajectories of cognitive functioning from young to late adulthood and incidence of AD in old age. We will examine social and biological mechanisms influencing cognitive trajectories and sex differences. Tested mechanisms will include social stress related to socioeconomic status (SES) and social relationships, and biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic, neuroendocrine, and immune pathways implicated in AD. We will also test and integrate new biological data on immune function. Project Narrative The proposed project will examine the process of age change in cognitive function in relation to risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) throughout the adult life span and how such process is different for men and women. It seeks to better understand how social disadvantages such as low socioeconomic status and social isolation “get under the skin” to influence biological pathways to cognitive health as individuals age.

"Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) provides Georgia and the region with comprehensive clinical, research, and educational programs. This renewal application outlines our success in building an environment that encourages and supports innovative projects with a general theme of discovery and translation of new targets and mechanisms to enable early identification, early interventions, and ultimately prevention of AD. Given the well documented disparities in clinical research participation and burden of disease for AD in the African American community, the Emory ADRC focuses special effort to understand and address inter-individual differences in AD, ranging from ethno-racial factors to personal differences in genetic and protein variation. We benefit from generous institutional support from Emory, one of the nation's fastest growing research academic medical centers, the generous Atlanta community, and a highly collaborative team from more than 20 departments and centers. Five Cores (Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistics, Neuropathology, and Outreach Recruitment and Education), coordinate activities to effectively recruit, evaluate, and engage a diverse cohort of volunteers who actively participate in a wide variety of research studies that aim to better define the trajectory from normal cognitive aging to symptomatic stages of disease. Data from the Cores are captured and stored for distribution to local researchers and for national collaborations. Our biospecimen banks include well-characterized neuropathological case materials, blood and CSF, and DNA. These valuable resources are distributed widely for a variety of approved studies of genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and pathological investigations. The ADRC educational programs reach a broad audience of students, health care professionals, and the public. Three cutting edge research projects are closely integrated with ADRC Cores: Project 1, AD Biomarkers and Endothelial Dysfunction in Caucasians and African Americans, is a longitudinal biomarker study with full integration into the ADRC Clinical Core and OREC, leveraging a unique community based Registry for Remembrance to facilitate recruitment of African Americans; Project 2, A Proteogenomic Approach to Understanding AD GWAS Results, proposes to use state-of-the art targeted gene resequencing and mass spectrometer-based protein sequencing to advance understanding of genetic risk of AD by genetic loci by linking novel gene variants at 20+ recently identified loci directly with the encoded and expressed protein variants in AD brain in an allele specific manner; Project 3, Defining the Properties of Pathogenic Aβ strains in Alzheimer's Disease, takes an interdisciplinary approach to build on pioneering work showing AD brain extracts are transmissible in animal models, by investigating how structural differences in Aβ strains from asymptomatic vs. symptomatic stages of AD vary in their seeding and propagation in yeast and animal models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Emory ADRC has grown dramatically during the past funding cycles (years 6-10), and now seeks a 3rd renewal (years 11-15). The ADRC contributes to the NIH/NIA-funded network and plays a critical role in the coordinated response to the growing public health threat from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emory's active participation in the network fosters research to understand the causes, investigate novel targets and interventions that will lead to more effective treatments and prevention, and improve the treatment of affected individuals with AD and related conditions, and the well being of their family caregivers.",Emory Alzheimer's Disease Center,9706071,P50AG025688,"['Academic Medical

"Social inequalities and the onset of Alzheimer's pathology: The role of Race/Ethnicity, cognitive reserve, and occupational complexity Abstract Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the fifth most common cause of death, and the only major cause of death for which there is no prevention or cure. It is thus crucial that we improve our understanding of the etiology of the disease. Social disadvantage likely plays an important role in Alzheimer's, in part because it modifies the risk of risks. Despite theoretical reasoning that social disadvantage should be associated with the risk of ADRD, results from clinical and behavioral studies diverge. We propose to examine whether domains of social inequality are associated with survival rates derived from a novel method that uses accelerated declines in cognitive functioning, which are known to precede ADRD, as a biomarker for the disease. The aims are to examine whether Race/Ethnicity, educational attainment, occupational complexity, and gender/sexuality are indicators of risk of Alzheimer's-related declines. This study further responds to an NIA call to study the role of health disparities in determining risk of ADRD pathology (PA-15-349). This study thus addresses NIA Goal B by improving our understanding of societal factors influencing cognitive decline and the risk of ADRD, and helps to improve our understanding of correlates of ADRD (NIA Goal D). ! Narrative Alzheimer's disease is the fifth most common cause of death, and the only major cause of death for which there is no prevention or cure. To date, efforts to identify correlates of Alzheimer's pathology have been limited by a lack of sensitivity in statistical models for preclinical forms of Alzheimer's disease. This study proposes that we are defining cognitive decline incorrectly and proposes a novel theory about the shape of cognitive decline paired with a novel method to examine the extent to which four domains of social disadvantage are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's pathology. ! !","Social inequalities and the onset of Alzheimer's pathology: The role of Race/Ethnicity, cognitive reserve, and occupational complexity",9660736,RF1AG058595,"['Acceleration ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cognition ', ' Financial cost ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sexuality ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Shapes ', ' Sister ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Occupational ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' social inequality ', ' regional difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' International ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Cognitive ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Characteristics ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' early onset ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' resilience ', ' pathological aging ', ' social disparities ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' normal aging ', ' ethnic disadvantage ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' cognitive performance ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' health data ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' care costs ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,RF1,2019,3327587,0.12794911211880353
"The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study Project Summary Identification of successful prevention and treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has remained elusive, partially because clinical symptoms of AD have a late presentation in disease development, but also because there are not clear targets directly related to AD neuropathology for which definitive treatment is available. Thus, focusing on possible treatment and prevention targets that can be identified well before onset of clinical disease and which are known to be treatable is critical in addressing AD. The vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia, including AD, offers an important opportunity for prevention and treatment. Further, evidence suggests that vascular risk factors, including hypertension and diabetes, as well as brain cerebrovascular changes (i.e. white matter hyperintensities), contribute most to the development of cognitive decline and dementia when they are present in midlife (well before clinical AD usually presents). Some of this evidence has been established by the ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a community-based biracial cohort study of individuals from four US communities, with nearly 30 years of vascular risk factors and marker data, and its primary ancillary study, the ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC- NCS). The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study, the renewal of which is being proposed in this application, built on the valuable data available in ARIC and ARIC-NCS. By focusing on brain amyloid-β deposition, which in leading hypotheses is responsible for the development of AD, the ARIC-PET study further evaluated the associations between midlife vascular risk factors and AD. In the initial phase of this study, we completed 347 brain amyloid PET scans, using florbetapir PET, among participants from three ARIC sites. We found higher rates of brain amyloid in participants who were older, female, carried an APOE ϵ4 allele (the primary genetic risk factor for AD), and who were of black race. Although our data did not support a general association between midlife vascular risk factors and brain amyloid, for persons with “two hits”: a high genetic risk (carriers of an APOE ϵ4 allele) and elevated midlife vascular risk, our data do suggest more brain amyloid deposition. Finally, our data suggest that cognition is worse among participants who have both elevated brain amyloid and high amounts of brain cerebrovascular disease, on MRI. This renewal application proposes a repeat brain MRI and florbetapir (amyloid) PET scan among all surviving non-demented participants of ARIC-PET, to evaluate how vascular risk factors and brain subclinical vascular changes and APOE genotype each contribute to the progression of brain amyloid as well as the progression of clinical cognitive status, including conversion to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Further, we will evaluate progression of brain cerebrovascular changes as a risk factor for progression of brain amyloid and clinical cognitive status, which we hypothesize may provide a critical link to explain some of our observed racial disparities in amyloid deposition rates. The ARIC-PET cohort provides unique data in a biracial sample; data from its renewal could identify important targets for prevention. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that vascular risk factors play a major role in the development of dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET Amyloid imaging study used PET scans to further understand the role of vascular disease in Alzheimer’s, and the studies proposed in this renewal will test how change in vascular disease relates to change in brain amyloid and cognition.

"MRI markers of brain aging and risk factors for cognitive decline in older African Americans ABSTRACT The aging research community has identified numerous risk factors associated with the full spectrum of cognition including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and there is greater understanding of the underlying brain mechanisms. Unfortunately, the vast majority of knowledge comes from studies of primarily non-Hispanic Whites. Although African Americans bear a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment, the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying these disparities remain elusive. The overall goal of the proposed study is to investigate the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms linking culturally-relevant psychosocial risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD in older African Americans. Existing literature with MRI data in older African Americans has focused almost exclusively on cross-sectional associations of cognition or incident AD, and has examined traditional risk factors. Very few studies of African Americans have examined culturally relevant risk factors with repeated measures of cognitive function and brain integrity over time to test the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms linking risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD. We propose to interrogate changes in structural and functional integrity on MRI as key neurobiologic substrates linking these socially relevant risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD in African Americans. Leveraging the well-established infrastructure of the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), including available data on risk factors, and repeated measures of cognitive function, we will use a multi-modal neuroimaging approach to acquire antemortem MRI scans on 400 African Americans and quantify change in a number of brain MRI indices to address the Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine the relation of change in brain MRI indices with rate of cognitive decline and risk of AD among older African Americans; Aim 2 will examine the relation of early and mid-life cultural risk factors with change in structural and functional brain MRI indices among older African Americans; Aim 3 will determine if change in brain MRI indices affects the relation of early- and mid-life risk factors to rate of decline and risk of AD among older African Americans; and taking advantage of neuroimaging and cognitive function data available at no cost from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), Aim 4 will identify racial differences in the relation of change in MRI structural and functional brain integrity to cognitive decline. Cognitive impairment associated with aging is a large and growing public health problem that disproportionately burdens African Americans. Knowledge of the neurobiologic pathways linking risk factors to cognitive decline will ultimately provide targets for future prevention/intervention studies, and will have a strong and sustained impact on the field.

"Exceptional Cognitive Aging: Neuropsychologic, Anatomic and Pathologic Correlates PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Memory complaints are widespread among the elderly and aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to the impression that a gradual loss of memory ability, eventually culminating in dementia, may be a nearly universal consequence of getting old. Cycle 1 of this project explored an alternative aging trajectory by studying 80+ year olds, we labeled “SuperAgers,” who have episodic memory performance that appears to have escaped age-related decline and that remains in the range that is at least normal for 50-60 year-olds. We enrolled a dedicated and unique cohort of participants committed to longitudinal assessment and brain donation at death. During Cycle 1 we identified domain- specific biologic, psychosocial, and genetic features of the SuperAgers, including maintenance of cortical integrity (especially in the anterior cingulate), an abundance of anterior cingulate Von Economo neurons and sparse cortical Alzheimer pathology compared to their cognitively average peers. These features may contribute in part to maintenance of superior memory performance past the 8th decade of life. Building on the findings of Cycle 1, this competitive renewal proposes to examine the SuperAging phenotype through the integrity of brain networks, gene expression, synaptic features and its resilience to AD pathology. We will also enhance our collaborative efforts by establishing an African American SuperAger cohort through a consortium. Aim 1 will focus on brain network integrity using graph theory. Aim 2 will focus on synaptic integrity, resilience to AD / other pathology, and gene expression. Aim 3 will enhance our established collaborative SuperAging resource through the collection of new data through the initiation of a harmonized multi-site study of African American SuperAgers. The proposed project will allow us to expand our unique group of SuperAgers and cognitively average peers. By identifying neurobiologic features that contribute to superior memory performance in old age, outcomes from this project will help us isolate factors that promote successful cognitive aging and perhaps also prevent age-related brain diseases such as AD. The project's reliance on a cohort that has already been partially recruited, its longitudinal design, multidisciplinary structure, and collaboration-friendly organization increases the likelihood that consequential progress will be achieved.

"Tau PET imaging in racially/ethnically diverse middle-aged adults PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most devastating international public health epidemics. There are currently no effective disease-modifying or preventative strategies. Current pathogenic models of AD emphasize a precipitating role of beta amyloid (Aβ) pathology, which stimulates tau deposition, neurodegeneration, and cognitive dysfunction. But recent work suggests that tau deposition frequently occurs prior to Aβ, could begin in midlife, and could be potentiated by other factors, including cerebrovascular disease. Tau pathology may play a role in AD racial/ethnic disparities, as the incidence and prevalence of AD is greater among African Americans and Hispanics, who have greater exposure to vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease. Thus, there are likely multiple pathways beginning in midlife that promote tau deposition and cognitive decline associated with AD, which may vary across racial/ethnic groups. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which tau deposition is related to cognitive function, to determine whether tau deposition varies across racial/ethnic groups, and to determine the extent to which cerebrovascular disease is associated with tau pathology in midlife. We will obtain tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging among 150 middle-aged adults who are receiving high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, Aβ PET, and comprehensive clinical evaluation as part of their participation in a study titled “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease” (RF1 AG054070, MPI: J.J. Manly/A.M. Brickman). The aims of the proposed project are: 1. To determine whether tau pathology is associated with cognitive functioning in midlife. We hypothesize that increased tau deposition in the medial temporal lobes will be associated with poorer episodic memory functioning and odor identification deficits. 2. To determine whether tau pathology differs across racial and ethnic groups in midlife. We hypothesize that Hispanics and African Americans will have greater amounts of tau pathology relative to non-Hispanic Whites. 3. To determine whether markers of cerebrovascular disease are associated with tau pathology in midlife and whether race/ethnicity moderates this association. We hypothesize that magnetic resonance imaging-derived markers of cerebrovascular disease, including white matter hyperintensities, infarcts, and microbleeds, will be associated with increased tau. We also expect that the relationship between markers of cerebrovascular disease and tau pathology will vary across racial/ethnic groups. Successful completion of this study will potentially point to novel intervention targets for the prevention of AD in addition to identifying sources of racial/ethnic disparities in the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase, yet the causes of this devastating disease are poorly understood. This project will examine the degree to which markers of AD pathology are associated with cognition in midlife and differences in AD biomarkers across racial/ethnic groups. It will also examine the role of cerebrovascular disease in promoting AD pathology to provide novel mechanistic insight into these disease and help identify new targets for intervention during

"Determining the effects of neighborhood disadvantage in preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The social and economic environment in which we live has a major impact on our physical and mental health and risk of developing diseases ranging from cancer to major depressive disorder to heart disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death and a major, and rising, contributor to health care expenditures in the United States. Socioeconomic disparities exist in the diagnosis, treatment and outcomes related to AD and socioeconomic disadvantage is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Understanding how exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage leads to increased AD risk could provide insight into new treatment and prevention efforts targeted at the most vulnerable populations. Despite this critical need, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and AD are currently unknown. To address this understudied topic, the proposed project will couple a validated, multi-dimensional index of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage with a rich longitudinal dataset including state of the art neuroimaging, cognitive testing and biochemical data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's disease Prevention (WRAP) and Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center study cohorts. Preliminary data generated for this project suggests that exposure to high levels of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage in cognitively unimpaired late-middle aged adults is associated with worse performance on a memory task, decreased volume of the hippocampus (a brain structure critical for memory processes) and elevated levels of AD biomarkers in the cerebral spinal fluid. These findings suggest a relationship between high levels of neighborhood disadvantage and pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease pathology in late middle age, a time of increased risk for eventually developing AD. The proposed project will specifically interrogate the relationship between exposure to neighborhood disadvantage in late-middle age and 1) longitudinal decline in performance on memory-related cognitive tasks, 2) longitudinal atrophy in associated memory- related brain regions and microstructural white matter changes in tracts connected to those regions and 3) how AD pathology (amyloid and tau) moderates these relationships. The results of this study will provide insight into the relationship between exposure to neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage during late middle age and preclinical AD. These studies will lay the groundwork for subsequent mechanistic studies of these relationships and can help inform policy targeted at ameliorating disparities in Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease disproportionately affects people with high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage, but little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that explain this relationship. This research project combines a robust metric of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage generated from the U.S Census and American Community Survey with neuroimaging and AD biomarker data from the longitudinal Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohorts to uncover relationships between neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage and pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease pathology. The results of this research will provide insight into potential pathways by which exposure to high levels of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases the risk of AD, and will have implications for addressing known disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",Determining the effects of neighborhood disadvantage in preclinical Alzheimer’s

"Racial Differences in Late-Life Cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT The prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive decline in our aging population is a major public health priority. The older Black population is growing at a rapid pace and a significant body of evidence suggests that they suffer a greater burden of cognitive impairment and dementia compared to older Whites. Studies which collect brain tissue from well-characterized older Blacks with sufficient cognitive follow-up and risk factors are crucial to advance our understanding of the pathologic substrates underlying AD in older Blacks. In prior funding periods, the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) made considerable progress identifying risk factors for cognitive decline in older Blacks. We enrolled a large cohort of well-characterized persons, followed them annually, and reported social, psychological, and medical risk factors related to cognitive decline, many of which appear to increase the burden of impairment compared with Whites. We also obtained autopsy from a subsample of participants who agreed to brain donation. The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to address gaps in the understanding of racial differences in the relation of risk factors and the pathologic substrates of incident AD and late-life cognitive decline. Leveraging ten years of data collection on risk factors, cognitive and motor function, a unique source of brain tissue, and donated data on Whites from ongoing studies at Rush, we propose to continue collecting clinical and postmortem data on MARS participants, test whether motor function may serve as a new biomarker for AD, and quantify new histopathologic and postmortem brain MRI indices to measure the impact of cerebrovascular pathologies in Blacks who come to autopsy. Aim 1 will examine racial differences in the association of demographic, lifestyle, and motor risk factors with incident AD. Aim 2 will examine nonlinear change in cognition and test hypotheses regarding racial differences in the effects of risk factors on changes in slope before and after incident AD. Aim 3 will evaluate racial differences in change in mobility and the associations of mobility with incident AD. Finally, Aim 4 will obtain more extensive data on cerebrovascular disease pathologies and postmortem brain MRI indices to determine the relation of brain indices to cognitive and motor function in Blacks, and compare the burden of cerebrovascular pathologies in Blacks and Whites. The proposed study provides a unique opportunity to answer critical questions about a large understudied segment of our aging society. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will integrate postmortem brain examination into an ongoing cohort study of risk factors for AD in older Blacks and compare them to matched Whites to identify racial differences in the pathologic substrates of AD.

"Diet in relation to brain and cognitive health in a middle-aged multiethnic population: nutritional implications for aging and Alzheimer's disease. Project Summary/Abstract  With lack of effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it is critical to identify modifiable preventive measures such as diet that can prolong healthy aging and reduce risk of AD, especially in the middle-age, which might be a potentially critical window for successful intervention. Our previous work from the longitudinal Washington Heights, Hamilton Heights, and Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) has indicated that adherence to either a Mediterranean-type diet or other healthy diets was related to decreased risk for AD and better brain and cognitive measures in elderly subjects. Based on the recently funded OFFSPRING study, the proposed study is an important extension of our efforts to understand whether diet is related with brain and cognitive health in middle-aged offspring of the multi-ethnic WHICAP participants. As it is believed that AD pathology begins in the brain in the 5th or 6th decades of life, identifying factors that can prevent the earliest decline in brain or cognition in these life periods will be extremely important towards a successful prevention of AD in late life. Furthermore, Hispanics and African-Americans have two to three times higher rates of AD than non-Hispanic Whites, and such racial disparities appears to be more prominent in mid-life. While many environmental- and individual-level adverse factors, including socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors, account for a substantial proportion of the racial disparities in cognitive performance, there remain unexplained race-related variations in cognition. Diet may represent a key modifiable lifestyle factor that additionally explains this racial disparity. Identifying and evaluating potential protective dietary factors for AD among middle-aged multiethnic populations will help to clarify potential modifiers for disparities in cognitive impairment and lay a solid foundation for prioritizing public health efforts. The overall aim of this study is to examine whether diet is related with sensitive brain and cognitive measures among 3,000 middle- aged offspring of a multiethnic group of parents. Specifically, the project will: 1) Examine whether dietary patterns are related to cognitive measures in middle-aged adults; investigate whether above associations differ among Hispanics, African-Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites; 2) Examine whether diet is related to multimodal neuroimaging measures; investigate whether the associations between diet and brain imaging biomarkers (neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular events, brain connectivity, neuropathology, and a Neuroimaging index) differ among Hispanics, African-Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites; 3) Examine whether early-life dietary exposure (indirectly estimated by offspring parents’ diets or directly recalled) is related to mid-life brain and cognitive health. Overall, successful completion of the proposed studies will provide important information on the role of diet in brain and cognitive health in middle-aged subjects, which will provide important nutritional implications for healthy aging promotion and AD prevention. Relevance Promoting healthy aging and preventing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is of increasing concern to an aging population as the baby boom generation approaches age 65. With lack of effective treatment for AD, it is therefore important to identify modifiable preventive measures such as diet that can prolong healthy aging and reduce risk of AD, especially in the midlife, which might be a critical window for successful intervention. This is also particularly important for African-Americans and Hispanics who are at increased risk of developing the disease compared to similarly aged non-Hispanic Whites.",Diet in relation to brain

"Advance Care Planning in the Dementias: Culturally-Tailored Caregiver Education for African Americans African Americans face significantly greater risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and other dementias than white Americans but receive disproportionately less attention to dementia screening and support, resulting in a silent epidemic in this underserved population. Advance Care Treatment Plan (ACT-Plan) is a culturally-tailored caregiver education program for African American dementia caregivers with decisional responsibility that was previously evaluated in an R01 study. The program comprises four 1-hour group sessions of instruction with interactive exercises and homework. In a randomized controlled trial (R01AG043485), outcomes included significant improvements in caregiver knowledge and self-efficacy in advance care treatment decision-making for loved ones with dementia. While found effective, the above intervention was delivered in person by content experts, which is neither practical nor cost-effective for wide dissemination of this much-needed form of support. Thus alternative means of delivery are desirable. In African American communities many faith-based organizations maintain active health ministries, making them a natural resource with personnel that provide valuable service to members of their congregations and other community members. This FastTrack project will produce and evaluate a self-directed multimedia version of the ACT-Plan program, to be called “ACT-Plan(m)”, that can be facilitated by local, non-expert volunteers from health ministries of faith-based organizations, and others. If successful, this will enable wide dissemination of this form of caregiver education in African American communities. Phase I Aims: 1. Produce a prototype module of the ACT-Plan(m) program. 2. Conduct usability testing with three test groups using the prototype module. 3. Assess usability data and caregiver outcomes. Phase II Aims: 1. Produce all modules of the ACT-Plan(m) program. 2. Produce website for streaming and downloads of program materials. 3. Assess impact of ACT-Plan(m) on caregiver knowledge and self-efficacy in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize that caregivers receiving ACT-Plan(m) will attain significant improvements in knowledge and self-efficacy outcomes comparable to those of the original ACT-Plan program. Commercial product. ACT-Plan(m) will be a standardized, evidence-based caregiver education program for use by faith-based and secular health advocacy organizations serving the African American community, as well as private individuals. The program will be accessible online with video streaming and downloadable print materials, and in hard copy format (DVD, flash drive, and printed materials) for low-resource settings, portability, lending libraries, and users without web access. This new resource will empower community-based health advocacy organizations to better address dementia care in underserved African American communities. It will be the first evidence-based, culturally-tailored, self-directed multimedia dementia caregiver education program to aid African Americans in managing advance care planning and end of life decision-making. Public health benefits include reduced suffering and costs of end of life care for families and society.

"Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Due to Ambulance Diversion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2007, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) characterized ambulance diversion (AD), the practice by which Emergency Departments (EDs) are temporarily closed, as ""antithetical to quality medical care"" and called for its ""elimination"". Nevertheless, A persists, with 45% of EDs and 70% of urban EDs reporting AD in the last published survey in 2003. AD has been associated with higher mortality, delayed treatment, and other adverse outcomes. Not examined hitherto, AD has the potential to exacerbate disparities by race/ethnicity and income. AD may also increase healthcare costs. However, the current literature on the impact of AD is based on data from convenience sampling and is limited by a dearth of experimental evidence. On 1/1/2009, Massachusetts became the first, and to date only, state to ban AD. Treating the state-imposed ban as a natural experiment, we propose to estimate the causal impact of AD on access, outcomes, and cost, focusing on the potentially differential effects by race/ethnicity and income.  To better understand ambulance use and AD within the milieu of overall patient care, we will develop a national longitudinal database of ambulance use based on Medicare administrative data. Using longitudinal patient records, this data will be better suited to examine the determinants of ambulance use, outcomes, and the impact of AD across diverse patients.  We will focus on older adults with a chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary condition. We will identify a national cohort of a stratified random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 or older (N=1,000,000), with an oversample from Massachusetts, and obtain data on all healthcare utilization, including ambulance and ED visits, from 2006-2012. Given the primacy of residential location in examining ambulance and ED use, this sample will be stratified by race/ethnicity and residence zip code to enable comparison of diverse patients from the same area. For the subset of Boston residents (Boston cohort) we will merge data from the Boston Emergency Medical Services (EMS) from 2006-2012 for EMS-specific outcome measures. Our specific aims are to evaluate: (1) incidence of ambulance use and reliance, (2) differences by race/ethnicity and income in ambulance transport outcomes, and (3) impact of Massachusetts AD ban on outcomes of ambulance transport and other ED patients not transported by ambulance.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has highlighted the ""limited"" research and knowledge base of EMS practices. Using novel data with national scope, this study will make significant contributions to this evidence base and inform public policy on AD regarding not only its impact on clinical outcomes, but also, its impact on disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine (IOM) characterized ambulance diversion (AD), the practice by which Emergency Departments (EDs) are temporarily closed, as ""antithetical to quality medical care"" and called for its ""elimination"". Massachusetts is the only state to ban AD, effective 1/1/2009. Using a novel data of ambulance use developed from administrative data from Medicare and Boston Emergency Medical Services, this study will use quasi-experimental methods to estimate the causal impact of AD on ambulance travel, type of destination ED, patient mortality, length of stay, and costs.",Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Due to Ambulance Diversion,9621407,R01HL127212,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Ambulances ', ' Boston ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' cost measurement ', ' Cost metrics ', ' Cost Measures ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Destinations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' beneficiary ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Natural experiment ', ' safety net ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' longitudinal database ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,168167,0.11391560631937965
"Midlife cognitive aging in Hispanic/Latinos:  Predictors and mechanisms of decline PROJECT SUMMARY Individuals from Hispanic/Latino backgrounds have a 50% increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to non-Hispanic white individuals. With the changing demographic trends in the United States, the prevalence of AD in the Hispanic/Latino population is expected to increase nine fold over the next 50 years. In addition to the patient, the burden of AD takes a significant toll on the families of loved ones with dementia, their communities, and the healthcare system. The difference in prevalence of AD is rooted in social disparities rather than differences in genetic vulnerability between Hispanic/Latino and white populations. It is critical to identify the specific social determinants in Hispanic/Latino populations that can be leveraged to develop culturally informed interventions that aim to maintain cognitive health and slow or prevent the progression toward mild cognitive impairment and clinical dementia. Midlife is a particularly important, yet understudied, period of the lifespan for cognitive aging. Prevention and intervention efforts are likely to be more effective if started before significant neuropathology accumulates in the brain. The objective of this proposal is to identify midlife factors and associated processes that contribute to health disparities in cognitive decline and risk of dementia. We will leverage an existing longitudinal study of midlife adults – the California Families Project – to couple more than 10 years of repeated assessments across middle adulthood with new data collection on the risk/protective factors and cognitive outcomes. This project will test socioeconomic (e.g., education, financial hardship), personality (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness), social (e.g., discrimination, social support), and acculturation (e.g., cultural values, acculturative stress) risk/protective factors for cognitive functioning in midlife Hispanic/Latino adults and the behavioral (e.g., physical inactivity, smoking), psychosocial (e.g., depressive symptoms, delay discounting), and physiological (e.g., inflammation, cellular biomarkers) mechanisms that explain these associations. This work will lead to new knowledge on midlife predictors of cognition and risk of AD, identify social determinants and pathways that create and sustain health disparities for Hispanic/Latino populations, and point to new prevention and intervention targets for promoting healthy cognitive aging in midlife and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults of Latino origin have a 50% increased risk of the disease compared to non-Latino white adults, a difference due to social determinants rather than differences in genetic vulnerability. Identifying modifiable risk/protective factors in this population and the processes through which these factors contribute to cognitive decline and dementia is critical to develop prevention and intervention strategies to both reduce disparities and promote healthy cognitive aging.",Midlife cognitive aging in Hispanic/Latinos:  Predictors and mechanisms of decline,9786190,U01AG060164,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' California ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' cost shifting ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Inflammation ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maintenance ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' processing speed ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' social integration ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Population Process ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' discount ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' discounting ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' loved ones ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' higher education ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' protective factors ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,1231078,0.15354709465427863
"Long-term Effects of ACTIVE Cognitive Training on Everyday Functioning and Dementia-related Outcomes: Association of Race and Social Determinants of Health ABSTRACT The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study is the largest randomized clinical trial (N = 2802) of the efficacy of cognitive training in improving cognitive and everyday functioning in normal older adults. To our knowledge, the 26% African American (AA) ACTIVE sample is the largest study of minority older adults regarding the effectiveness of cognitive training. A 20-year ACTIVE follow-up (AG056486) is in progress, linking Medicare/Medicaid Claims, National Death Index, driving records, and credit reports, to examine the association of training effectiveness with long-term reduction in disability, loss of independence, and incident dementia in advanced old age. This 20-year follow-up involves no funding or aims directed toward examination of long-term training effects for the AA sample. The proposed supplement would provide funding for an in-depth examination of the association between race and social determinants of health (SDoH) in regard to long-term training effectiveness for AA on cognitive abilities, everyday functioning, and incidence of dementia. Supplement findings will fill a critical knowledge gap regarding the role of SDoH in understanding racial disparities in the efficacy of cognitive training, thereby informing future generations of cognitive intervention research and the role of intervention in regard to the significantly higher incidence of dementias in AA older adults. Moreover, the supplement would involve multiple AA and minority co- investigators through the support and collaboration of RCMAR and AD-RCMAR centers at JHU, UAB, and UF. ACTIVE participants trained on memory, reasoning, or processing speed performed significantly above controls at 5- and 10-year follow-ups on cognitive tasks in their respective domain of training. In addition, trained participants in all training arms reported less difficulty in performing IADL tasks at 10-year follow-up. Speed and reasoning training were associated with a reduced incidence of auto crashes as well as reduction in the number of participants who ceased driving relative to controls. At 10-year follow-up, promising findings suggested an effect of training on incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The proposed supplement will enable us to examine how race and SDoH affect cognitive training and the long-term outcomes of training. If the training programs evaluated are shown to be protective against long-term outcomes, this would suggest that early intervention may help to reduce health disparities in AD and related disorders and provide benefit to all older adults. Project Narrative The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) randomized clinical trial (N =2802), which involved 26% African American participants, found that cognitive training enhanced both cognitive abilities, everyday functioning, and independent living at 5- and 10-year follow-ups. The Supplement would examine the association of race and social determinants of health in regard to cognition, cognitive training effects and everyday functioning. Given African Americans suffer lifelong disadvantages and receive earlier and more frequent diagnoses of cognitive impairment or dementia, findings regarding the relationship between race and social determinants in relation to cognitive training and dementia can have significant public health benefits in planning future intervention efforts and in improving the lives of future cohorts of African American elders.",Long-term Effects of ACTIVE Cognitive Training on Everyday Functioning and Dementia-related Outcomes: Association of Race and Social Determinants of

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Ethnically Diverse Cohorts for the ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) PROJECT SUMMARY  The Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national sequencing initiative focused on identifying genetic risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in an effort to identify new pathways for prevention and new targets for drug development. The projects’ discovery phase included whole exome sequencing (WES) of 10,914 unrelated cases (N=5,778) and controls (N=5,136) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,019 familial samples. A majority of these samples are non-Hispanic white (NHW) in origin, making the addition of ethnically diverse samples to the study critical to identification of both shared and novel genetic risk factors for AD between populations. This ethnic diversity was emphasized in the ‘ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) Phase’ planning stage with a directive that additional existing cohorts with unrelated AD cases that ‘encompass the richest possible ethnic diversity’ be given the highest priority for inclusion.  To fulfill the goals of this RFA and this FUS Phase Mandate, this proposal identifies seven existing elderly cohorts of African-American (AA) and pan-HI ancestry with a total of 10,430 samples (N=2,322 AA AD cases and 1,843 AA controls and 2,928 Hispanic AD cases and 2,875 Hispanic controls) for WGS and processing in collaboration with existing NIH-funded AD infrastructure. Combining these cohorts with existing African America (AA) and Hispanic (HI) sequencing from the Washington Heights-Hamilton Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the ADSP will provide large ethnically diverse datasets for both validation of ADSP discovery phase findings and discovery of novel risk and/or protective variants for AD. Importantly, these data will allow for admixture mapping, a powerful method of gene mapping for diseases that show differential risk by ancestry, by comparing allele frequency differences between populations. They will also become an invaluable resource for the AD research community at-large, and will help to address the health disparities that contribute to AA and HI populations having higher rates of AD than NHW. Thus, we will address these important issues by creating a large dataset of AA and pan-HI AD cases and controls for study.  Specifically we propose to: 1) increase the ethnic diversity of the ADSP by assembling samples from existing cohorts with AA and HI AD cases and controls; 2) collaborate with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) in assemblage, storage, and distribution of DNA on these cohorts; 3) generating genome-wide SNP array data and WGS for all collected samples; and 4) collaborate with the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) in processing, quality controls, storage and distribution of the final datasets. Our overall goal is to enhance the discovery of AD risk factors by facilitating research on AD in ethnically diverse datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE To gather data and sequence 10,000 individuals from diverse cohorts in the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) creating an invaluable resource for the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research community at large. We will do this by 1) assembling samples from existing cohorts with African-American (AA) and Hispanic (HI) AD cases and controls in conjunction with Columbia University, 2) by collaborating with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) in assembling DNA on these individuals, 3) by generating genome-wide SNP array data at the University of Miami (UM) and whole genome sequencing data at New York Genome Center (NYGC), and 4) by collaborating with the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and the Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) in processing, storing and delivering final datasets.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Ethnically Diverse Cohorts for the ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS),9827751,U01AG057659,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Americas ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Mexican ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' drug development ', ' repository ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Validation ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' dbGaP ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' human genomics ', ' SNP array ', ' SNP chip ', ' admixture mapping ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' protective factors ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,405731,0.12920033073107134
"Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this application, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a presidentially initiated effort to understand the genetics of AD in hopes of developing new targets for therapies. Currently lacking in these efforts, however, is the inclusion of African American (AA) populations and the generalization of research findings to AA communities. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we propose a set of experiments that will complement the activities in the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases while addressing the issue of health disparities in AA AD research.",Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans,9827768,U01AG052410,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Community Networks ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' exhaustion ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' clinical practice ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' SNP array ', ' SNP chip ', ' admixture mapping ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,383750,0.04163752629583948
"Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral Vascular Disease in American Indians DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AIs) experience a disproportionately high incidence of cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) relative to non-Indians with twice the stroke rate of the general US population. Neuroimaging techniques have shown CBVD-related brain abnormalities to be associated with disruption of neurpsychological performance. Therapy for post-stroke cognitive impairment has been challenging. Cognitive therapy involves intense, focused, regular mental activity, intellectual stimulation, and behaviora exercises that assist individuals to regain or maintain cognitive function. and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia after brain insult. Interactive Metronome (IM) therapy is a promising form of behavioral therapy for CBVD-related cognitive and motor function. This technology uses operant conditioning of an individual's responses through simple, repetitive motor tasks (e.g., clapping hands, tapping feet) in time with a set beat. Through visual and auditory feedback, IM addresses processing speed, attention, and immediate and delayed memory, all of which can be affected by CBVD. IM therapy can improve quality of life, physical mobility, gait, and CBVD- related cognitive deficits. The ongoing Strong Heart Stroke Study (SHSS) (1R01HL093086-01A1; Dedra Buchwald, PI) is investigating CBVD-related brain abnormalities through MRI scans on 1000 AIs from the original SHS cohort. The proposed study will capitalize on this current SHSS to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to ascertain the effects of a culturally tailored IM intervention on cognition, depression, and quality of life. We ill target SHSS participants with subclinical CVBD defined by impaired cognitive processing speed. We will select a sample of 180 American Indians age 68 to 80 years participating in the SHSS. The specific Aims for this study of older American Indians are as follows: 1) Determine if the culturally-adapted IM intervention can improve cognitive functioning among older AIs with CBVD; and 2) Estimate the impact of IM on health-related quality of life. This study will yield important insights into the relationships among cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and brain abnormalities that can inform treatment efforts as one way to reducing AI CBVD disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will further our knowledge of the relationships among of cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and CBVD-related brain abnormalities providing valuable direction for more effective screening, treatment, and prevention of CBVD-related cognitive impairment. Thus, this study has significant health disparities implications for American Indians who exhibit the highest rates of stroke and related risk factors.",Rhythm and Timing Exercises for Cerebral

"Rio Grande Valley Alzheimer's Resource Center for Minority Aging Research: Partnerships for Progress Summary OVERALL Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is an aging-associated disorder that disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who exhibit AD rates 1.5 times higher and average onset 7 years earlier than do older whites. Predicted growth of the US Hispanic population, particularly faster in Texas, portends further exacerbation of the disproportion- ate health and economic burdens of elevated AD in Hispanics. There is a shortage of researchers focused on AD and related disorders (ADRD) in Hispanics, particularly from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. To overcome these barriers, the proposed AD Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (AD-RCMAR) at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), one of the nation's largest Hispanic-serving institutions, will combine evidence-based mentoring and support mechanisms to develop and promote a first-rate regional and national cadre of researchers, particularly from under-represented groups, to analyze the complex mecha- nisms and interacting factors that contribute to Hispanics' disparate vulnerabilities to AD. The Center will sup- port identification of pathways and developmental time points at which changes in social circumstances and behavior can exert the largest favorable impacts on prevention and progression of AD among Hispanics. The UTRGV AD-RCMAR will exploit its unique resources to develop infrastructure and data collections that will at- tract and support researchers from multiple disciplines and at different scientific career stages, and allow them to conduct research aimed at reducing the impacts of AD on Hispanics. The socio-demographic profile of UTRGV reflects that of its local community, positioning the Center uniquely to advance studies of disparities in health and health care and contribute innovative solutions to improve minorities' health. We will achieve the Center's goals via 4 specific aims: 1) to identify, engage, mentor, and provide high-quality training and individu- alized career development support to outstanding faculty, especially from underrepresented groups; 2) to sup- port innovative, high-impact multidisciplinary pilot projects; 3) to provide expertise and resources for culturally- sensitive measurement and analysis of cognitive risk factors in older Hispanics, including behavioral, neuro- psychological, neuroimaging, and cardiovascular and genetic traits; and 4) to create the necessary expertise and resources to establish longitudinal research cohorts of older Hispanics and their families. We will achieve these aims through the creation of 4 Cores (Administrative; Research Education; Analysis; and Community Liaison/Recruitment) to support AD research. The Center will build upon the experience of investigators at the UTRGV Institute of Neuroscience and collaborators at the South Texas Diabetes & Obesity Institute, and Washington University's AD Research Center. Project Narrative Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is an aging-associated disorder that disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who represent the faster growing segment of the elderly population in the US and particularly in Texas. Build- ing on longstanding strengths in social, behavioral and biomedical research at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and facilitated by partnership with the Washington´s University Alzheimer´s Disease Research Center, the UTRGV AD-RCMAR will lead and coordinate an effort in South Texas to enhance the diversity of the research workforce of minority aging and develop infrastructure and data collections that will attract and support researchers from multiple disciplines and at different scientific career stages, and allow them to conduct research aimed at reducing

"Development of Culturally-Sensitive and Patient-Centered Feedback for Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk Disclosure Project Summary: Development of Culturally-Sensitive and Patient-Centered Feedback for Alzheimer's Dementia Risk Disclosure With improvement in neuroimaging and biomarker measurement, earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been made possible. Similarly, these methods have informed risk for Dementia – Alzheimer's Type (DAT), the advanced phenotypic presentation of AD. Accordingly, patient interest in understanding their personal risk for DAT has grown exponentially, with up to 90% of the population requesting DAT feedback. While studies have produced general suggestions for providing feedback about individual risk factors, no study has systematically compared patient and family member preferences for the amount and type of risk disclosure information received (standard clinical information, genotype, neuroimaging, biomarkers). Without understanding the expectations of diverse patient populations for DAT risk disclosure, we cannot effectively communicate the information gained through recent scientific advances, creating a translational problem. Furthermore, a critical oversight of existing DAT risk disclosure literature is an inattention to the patient-specific factors that dictate preferences for and ability to adapt to DAT risk feedback. In particular, psychological and sociocultural differences experienced by African-American patients and families are critical factors dictating feedback preferences and utility, but have not previously been evaluated in risk disclosure literature. The lack of culturally-informed feedback protocols represents an ethical and practical challenge facing all AD researchers, and an opportunity to directly address a potential source of healthcare disparities in a vulnerable population. The proposed project will respond to these identified empirical gaps by developing semi-structured feedback protocols for DAT risk disclosure that are informed by patient-specific characteristics, preferences and rationale. In Year 1, we will utilize the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Core Center's longitudinal cohort to conduct a systematic assessment of the needs and desires of a racially diverse sample of cognitively intact or MCI-diagnosed patients and their caregivers (Specific Aim 1). Specifically, we will investigate the desired level of risk information (none, based on readily clinically available information, genetic information, quantitative neuroimaging, and/or amyloid and tau biomarker burden), as well as personal motivations for requesting this information, in a sample of African-American and White older adults. The needs assessment will also analyze patient-specific factors that influence risk disclosure preferences in these samples, through the lens of the Health Belief Model. In Year 2 we will develop and pilot patient-centered feedback protocols informed by the results of Year 1, with immediate and follow-up measurement of patient and informant satisfaction, comprehension, and psychological reactions (Specific Aim 2). These protocols will represent a foundational first step towards culturally-sensitive, flexible DAT risk disclosure, appropriate across demographic groups. Project Narrative The proposed project will develop semi-standardized risk disclosure protocols for Dementia – Alzheimer's type (DAT), informed by a needs assessment of racially diverse patients and informants with early AD changes. By understanding and integrating knowledge of recipient characteristics, preferences, and rationales, we will create patient-centered feedback protocols to effectively communicate complex clinical, genetic, neuroimaging, and biomarker-conferred risk for DAT. The project therefore addresses a critical ethical and practical challenge facing all AD researchers by directly investigating and responding to a source of health disparity in vulnerable minority

"The Importance of the Neighborhood Environment in Determining Health and Well-being among Persons with Dementia and their Caregivers PROJECT SUMMARY The rapid increase in the population with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the United States constitutes a looming public health crisis. Dementia is a syndrome of progressive cognitive impairment and a leading cause of disability, loss of independence, institutionalization, and death in older adults. ADRD affect more than 5 million U.S. adults over age 65, but also impact an estimated 16 million family and friends who, as primary caregivers, are at increased risk of poor physical and mental health and social isolation. The prevalence of dementia is expected to increase as the population ages, and there is currently no known treatment that can cure or substantially slow its progression. A top public health priority, therefore, is to determine how to improve the lives of persons living with dementia (PWD) in order reduce the impact of dementia on PWD and their caregivers. Features of the neighborhood social, physical, built, and service environment may provide necessary support to PWD and their caregivers, or, alternatively, exacerbate the adverse impacts of dementia. The proposed study will determine how neighborhood-based supportive factors (e.g., meal delivery, home health care, amenities, walkability) and stressors (e.g., lack of safety, disorder, noise, traffic) affect health and well- being among PWD and their caregivers. We leverage data from two large, nationally representative, and longitudinal surveys that have collected information on thousands of PWD and their caregivers and provide information on their place of residence: the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). We will first create a national, longitudinal database of neighborhood characteristics that, as indicated by theory and research, reflect opportunities for physical activity, social engagement, and mental stimulation, supportive services and resources, and psychosocial stressors. Using this new data resource, which will be made available to the research community, we will estimate the impact of neighborhood-level factors on multiple dimensions of health and well-being (e.g., frailty, social engagement, institutionalization) for both PWD and their caregivers. We will further determine if health and well-being vary across groups defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, living alone, and residence in urban/rural areas and assess the role of the neighborhood in generating this inequality. To our knowledge, this will be the first empirical study to examine, in a national context, how neighborhoods can engender quality of life in PWD and their caregivers. The proposed study is timely because an increasing number of cities and communities are engaged in efforts to become more dementia-friendly. This project will identify aspects of neighborhoods and communities that support living well with dementia and inform policies and programs to reduce the costs and burden of dementia on individuals, families, and communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Neighborhoods may play an important role in determining quality of life among persons with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers. The objective of this project is to identify neighborhood-based resources and stressors that affect health and well-being among PWD and their caregivers. The knowledge generated from this project will have significant relevance for public health efforts, including the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease, to identify modifiable aspects of the environment that can improve the lives of PWD and their caregivers.",The Importance of the Neighborhood Environment in Determining Health and Well-being among Persons with Dementia and their Caregivers,9811332,R01AG064491,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavior ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Health ', ' home healthcare ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Noise ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social isolation ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' Dimensions ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' stressor ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' loss of function ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal database ', ' built environment ', ' informal caregiving ', ' Informal care giving ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' urban residence ', ' rural residence ', ' rural households ', ' rural dwelling ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,423998,0.0464676858916676
"Detecting Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Rural Underserved Communities through Community Based Participatory Research Project Summary There is currently no effective methodology for early detection and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in rural minority older adults, despite their increased risk. The overall objective of this K01 is to propel the development of Dr. Lisa Wiese as an independent researcher in community based participatory research (CBPR) interventions that position her for achieving her career goal of empowering these underserved residents to age-in-place and delay costly institutionalization. Research: The proposed research, Detecting Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Rural Underserved Communities through Community Based Participatory Research adapts Schoenberg’s proven model of faith-based interventions of education, screening, and referral for rural Appalachian residents (Faith Moves Mountains [FMM] 2009, 2011, 2012, 2016), to a different population and disease. We will apply the FMM intervention to increase a) AD knowledge and awareness of benefits of cognitive screening b) cognitive screening frequency among rural, minority and older adults (SA1). We will assess acceptance of dementia risk disclosure and referral, and evaluate adherence for follow-through with providers (SA2). We will examine the impact of FMM on local healthcare providers’ rates of AD diagnosis and treatment of both referred and non-referred patients (SA3). The findings from this study will inform the discovery of best practices for detection, diagnosis, and early intervention for rural and minority older populations at risk for AD; two groups vastly underrepresented in AD research. Candidate: Dr. Wiese is in her fourth year as an Assistant Professor of Nursing at Florida Atlantic University. Four training goals are designed to enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent, successfully funded investigator: 1. Gain expertise in CBPR for designing and testing a culturally relevant intervention. 2. Enhance skills in developing advanced statistical models for analyzing intervention research. 3. Expand understanding of state of the science regarding aging, health disparities, and AD. 4. Develop leadership skills for executing multicenter studies and mentoring junior researchers. Mentors/Environment: The current career development plan includes experiential learning with Dr. Galvin (as the primary mentor) in his clinical research setting. It also includes training in CBPR, learning advanced statistics through completion of well-established academic coursework, updating knowledge regarding science of aging, disease, and disparities through attendance at National Institute of Aging and Hartford Institutes, and increasing skills as a leader and scholar through monthly Skype or face-to-face meetings with the co-mentor Dr. Lingler, and collaborators Drs. Schoenberg and Williams. Dr. Wiese will continue to receive support from her own institution through internal grants, faculty education, and travel for networking and scholarship. The Office of Nursing Research and Scholarship, which assisted Dr. Wiese with successfully securing several previous small grants, including a summer research release, and multiple publications, has multiple avenues to support junior faculty. Project Narrative The short-term goal of this K01 is the development of the PI as an independent investigator in Community Based Participatory Research to improve health of two groups who are vastly underrepresented in aging research: rural and minority older adults. The K research proposal is the PI’s next step in discovering best practices for Alzheimer’s disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment in these underserved communities. The long-term goal is to mitigate disparities facing rural and minority older adults, thereby empowering their ability to age-in-place and delay costly institutionalization.",Detecting Alzheimer's

"Contributions of educational quality and occupational complexity on racial and ethnic inequities in brain health and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia ABSTRACT By 2050 nearly 14 million people will suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the US and minorities will be disproportionally burdened. While it is known that certain racial/ethnic groups, such as African Americans, have higher rates of dementia, reasons for disparities are unknown. Though education and occupation are robustly associated with ADRD, research on education quality and occupational complexity has primarily included only Whites or, when examining racial/ethnic differences, focused on comparisons between Whites and African Americans. We propose to examine the role of educational quality and occupational complexity on cognitive decline, ADRD, and imaging markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration in a cohort with unparalleled racial/ethnic diversity. The proposed study derives measures of education quality and occupational complexity, building upon the following rich data sources at Kaiser Permanente Northern California: detailed social and physical measures from a Multiphasic Health Checkup completed during the 1960s to 1990s; electronic medical records from 1996 onward; and detailed social, cognitive, and neuroimaging measures from the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) study assessments. KHANDLE collects the names and locations of schools attended at 1st, 6th, 9th, and 12th grades as well as college or university attended which will be linked to historical indicators of school quality. Comprehensive information collected regarding occupation enables delineation of occupational complexity in early-, mid-, and late-adulthood. Utilizing these comprehensive data sources, we are in a unique position to successfully complete the aims of the study, which are to: 1) Evaluate the roles of education quality on cognitive decline, ADRD incidence, and imaging markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration in African American, White, Asian, and Latino individuals; 2) Examine the role of occupational complexity on cognitive decline, ADRD incidence, and imaging markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration in this diverse cohort; 3) Delineate if patterns of educational quality and occupational complexity across the lifecourse mediate racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD, cognitive decline, and imaging markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration. Utilizing a lifecourse approach, as recommended by the NIH State of the Science on Preventing Cognitive Decline, the proposed research will add vital information regarding the characteristics and timing of education quality and occupational complexity characteristics associated with ADRD and may inform future interventions aiming to improve cognition among elderly of all racial/ethnic groups. Given the marked disparities in ADRD rates by racial/ethnic groups there has never been a more critical time to understand how sociocontextual risk factors impact brain health in diverse populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Education quality and occupational complexity are known protective factors against Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), which are major public health problems that disproportionately burden several minority groups, yet the majority of research is conducted among primarily White populations or examines differences between Whites and African Americans. Including more racially diverse populations in research provides major opportunities for understanding the determinants of ADRD. The results of this project will further define our knowledge of education quality and occupational complexity as protective factors against cognitive decline and ADRD in a diverse cohort and assess their possible role as drivers of racial and ethnic inequalities in heathy brain aging.",Contributions of educational quality and occupational complexity on racial and ethnic inequities in brain

"Blood Pressure and ADRD in African Americans: the Jackson Heart Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are two to three times higher among African Americans (AAs) than among White older adults. Observational and clinical trial data, most recently from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial: Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (SPRINT-MIND), support that blood pressure is the most important modifiable vascular risk factor for MCI and dementia. However, the short duration of follow-up in SPRINT-MIND coupled with the failure to detect a statistically significant benefit of a lower blood pressure goal for incident dementia means that longer-term observational data will be necessary to fully address the implications of the clinical trial results. These questions are particularly salient for AAs, who have earlier onset of high blood pressure and are at higher risk of dementia, in particular cerebrovascular pathology. Even after considering race/ethnic differences in blood pressure level, the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in risk for dementia are not well understood. Additionally, despite facing a high burden of high blood pressure, some individuals are resilient, achieving better-than-expected outcomes. The specific factors that contribute to brain-health resilience are not well established. We propose to address these research gaps in an ancillary study to the 2020-2022 4th examination of ~2,700 participants in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an ongoing cohort study of well-characterized AAs. The JHS Exam 4 will include brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to ascertain cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration. We propose to add measures of cognition and function sufficient for classification of MCI and dementia, and innovative plasma biomarkers of amyloid (Ab42, Ab40), tau, and neurodegeneration (neurofilament light). The primary aims are as follows: Aim 1. Estimate the long-term associations of exposure to high 20-year time-weighted average blood pressure and blood pressure load on (1) cognitive performance; (2) prevalence of MCI and dementia; (3) markers of cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration quantified from MRI; and (4) plasma amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration. Aim 2. Examine whether sex, educational quality (i.e. reading level measured with the WRAT), and APOE-e4 and ABCA7 genotype, modify the associations of long-term exposure to high blood pressure and blood pressure load with cognitive outcomes. This study is responsive to PAR-19-070 and NOT- AG-18-047 (Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease) by adding cognitive assessments to a landmark cohort study of cardiovascular disease in AAs; leveraging existing and new data to understand risk and resilience factors for cognitive impairment; and drawing on the JHS cohort to understand vascular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in a minority population. This study is also proposed in the context of the updated National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer’s Association research framework in which the constructs of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration are featured prominently. Lastly, results from this study will inform future research and have implications for policies intended to improve brain aging in minority populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will quantify the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, examine the associations of long-term exposure to high blood pressure with established and novel measures of brain health, and determine the role of biologic factors and social determinants of health in modifying the risk of MCI and dementia among African Americans.

"Metabolomics of Neurocognitive Risk for Dementia in Diabetes Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major epidemic associated with significant burdens on patients, families, and the public healthcare system. Its rise in prevalence is concomitant with an increase in diabetes-related comorbidities. Among these, diabetes has emerged as a reproducible risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying the risk for dementia in the disproportionately burdened T2D populations are poorly understood. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that metabolomic signatures of neurocognitive trajectory are present in diabetes and these signatures explain, in part, race disparities in cognitive decline between European Americans and African Americans with T2D. This hypothesis will be explored by re-examining the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS) cohort for neurocognitive trajectory using a well-established cognitive battery, literacy testing, and adjudicated physician diagnosis of dementia. Because neurodegenerative conditions, representative of cognitive decline, are progressive with pathology developing years prior to the observation of clinical symptoms and functional deficits, untargeted metabolomic analysis will be performed on baseline samples collected >10 years prior and correlated with cognitive trajectory. This approach offers the potential to identify relevant biomarkers before onset of overt disease. Finally, a comprehensive genetic analysis of the DHS participants to examine the genetic architecture of neurocognitive measures and metabolomic signatures of neurocognitive change will be performed. The composition of this study, inclusive of European American and African Americans participants, will provide generalizability of the findings. The timing of this study is critical to contrast changes in midlife to early-late adulthood to identify first stage pathophysiological changes facilitating the identification of relevant biomarkers with potential to improve the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify metabolomic signatures of cognitive trajectory in an aging adult cohort with comprehensive clinical (measures of subclinical vascular disease) and genetic data.",Metabolomics of Neurocognitive Risk for Dementia in Diabetes,9660891,R01AG058921,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Heart ', ' Joints ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' literacy ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Neurocognition ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cognitive development ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' protective factors ', ' genetic architecture ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,763841,0.1333742419690619
"Education and the Life-Course Pathways of Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, and Cognitive Decline in the United States and Mexico PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of the proposed research is to describe and cross-nationally compare the life-course pathways affecting cognition, cognitive impairment, dementia, and cognitive decline in the United States and Mexico. The PI, Dr. Joseph Saenz, received his Ph.D. in Population Health Science at the University of Texas Medical Branch where he received training in epidemiology and epidemiologic methods. Dr. Saenz has extensive experience studying health disparities in Mexico and the Mexican origin population in the United States. Joseph is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California (USC) where he has begun to study cognition in these populations. The proposed training will enhance the PI’s understanding of the measurement of cognition, and expose him to the approaches to cognitive aging used across various academic disciplines including demography, psychology, neuropsychology, and biology. Education is a strong predictor of cognitive function, cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), and dementia in late life. Education may affect the clinical manifestation of cognitive functioning directly by impacting the strength and structure of brain structures and by providing greater cognitive reserve to compensate for pathological changes in the brain. However, education may also affect cognition via indirect pathways including occupation, income, wealth, healthcare access, and chronic conditions. Understanding these pathways is highly significant given the aging of the U.S. and Mexican populations and the social and economic costs of cognitive impairment. Because aging is a life-course process that occurs within larger contexts, it is important to consider how larger demographic, economic, and political contexts across countries influence cognitive development and decline throughout the life-course. Further, by acknowledging these differing contexts, future work may design and implement cognitive interventions that are more precisely catered to the context in which they are applied. These results also shed light on differences in cognitive aging across developing and developed countries. While studies of aging in Mexico (Mexican Health and Aging Study) and the U.S. (Health and Retirement Study) have used differing measures of cognitive functioning and methods for measuring and classifying normal cognition, CIND, and dementia, the proposed research makes use of newly collected harmonized assessments of cognitive functioning to develop comparable measures of cognition and definitions of CIND and dementia. I will investigate the direct and indirect pathways throughout the life-course through which education affects cognitive functioning, CIND, dementia, and cognitive decline in late life using multinomial probit regression models, growth curve models, and linear regression models to model CIND and dementia, cognitive decline, and cognitive function as a function of variables spanning the life-course. USC is an ideal location to receive the training necessary for the proposal given the multidisciplinary nature of the gerontology center, global study of aging, focus on cognition and dementia, and availability of coursework and mentorship from leaders in demography, psychology, and clinical psychology. This training will also position the PI to begin an independent research career and to submit a successful R01 proposal in a faculty position. PROJECT NARRATIVE Education is strongly predictive of cognitive function and cognitive impairment in late life, the proposed research will cross-nationally examine the direct and indirect life-course pathways through which education influences cognition in late life in Mexico and the United States. These results will deepen our understanding of the role of education in cognitive function, and how larger demographic and social contexts may modify the pathogenesis of disease. Findings will suggest how, and at what stage of the life-course, societal resources should be allocated to be used most effectively.","Education and the Life-Course Pathways of Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, and Cognitive Decline in the United States and Mexico",9674324,K99AG058799,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' California ', ' Cognition ', ' Financial cost ', ' Demography ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mexico ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Pathology ', ' Politics ', ' Population Growth ', ' Psychology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Texas ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' career ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' cognitive function ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' health knowledge ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' economic cost ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' cost ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' population health ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K99,2019,77290,0.11038927676254708
"Reducing African Americans' Alzheimer's Disease Risk Through Exercise (RAATE) Abstract Alzheimer's Disease is steadily growing in prevelance, with a devastating public health impact. The prevelance of Alzheimer's Disease is higher in African Americans compared to white Americans, thereby constituting a health disparity. Interventions that prevent Alzheimer's Disease or change the course of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's Disease are needed. Most older adults do not achieve the recommended levels of physical activity, and this includes African Americans. Regular physical activity has proven to be a safe and effective means to enhance cognitive function in older adults ranging from cognitively healthy to mildly cognitively impaired. Therefore our study is focused on physical activity promotion, a potent approach to modifying multiple neurobiological pathways implicated in Alzheimer's Disease. We evaluate exercise benefits among elderly African Americans, who are understudied and in whom the natural course of neurodegeneration, exercise effects in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, and resulting clinical phenotypes may differ. A large body of exisiting data suggests that exercise improves cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, and thus has the potential to enhance perivascular clearance of amyloid and reduce chronic brain tissue ischemia, among other beneficial effects. At the same time, chronic exercise has been shown to decrease central levels of inflammatory markers and increase central levels of neurotrophic factors, which in turn promote protection against Alzheimer's Disease neurodegeneration pathways via a variety of mechanisms. While physical activity interventions have been shown to have positive effects on these factors and on resultant cognitive functioning in older adults, nearly all interventions have had a negligible representation of African Americans. Prior dara suggests that African Americans enter their elderly years against a backdrop of different lifespan exposures to a variety of factors relevant to neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, including cardiovascular risk, exercise, diet, and education. In addition, prior data suggests that the key genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Diease (APOE) may have differing consequences for Alzheimer's Diease risk among African Americans, and other genetic differences have the potential to influence the brain benefits of physical activity in this community. We will utilize a randomized clinical trial to address these questions. Participants will be randomized into a physical promotion intervention or a healthy aging information group for 52 weeks. All participants will be of normal cognitive function. We will assess cognitive function, brain structure and function, circulating hormones, objectively measured physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and telomere length. Our study will take the first step toward understanding whether the hypothesized benefits of exercise for the brain carry over to elderly African Americans. Narrative African American adults have two-times the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease compared to other ethnic groups. The current study (called “RAATE”) will determine if regular physical activity conducted over a year will reduce risk factors for developing Alzheimer's Disease in older African American adults. We will assess participants brain functioning, brain structure, memory, and chromosomes.",Reducing African Americans' Alzheimer's Disease Risk Through Exercise (RAATE),9687323,R01AG062200,"['Adult ',

"Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Ethnic Factors: The Case of Arab Americans - Administrative Supplement #2 (Enhanced Saliva Collection) Project Abstract This application for an NIA Administrative Supplement proposes to expand the Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Ethnic Factors: The Case of Arab Americans (R01AG057510) study by measuring genome-wide genotypes and incorporating alleles of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). The study is the first of its kind to focus on AD health disparities in Arab Americans (N=600) aged 65 and over living in the metro-Detroit area, home to the largest and most visible Arab American community in the US. We propose to extend our health disparities research by collecting genome-wide genotype data using the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array-24 v1.0 (GSA) BeadChip. Further, we plan to compare and contrast the frequency of APOE-ε4 to representative samples of non-Arab whites and blacks from the same geographic area. By expanding our project to include genetic data, we will be uniquely positioned to address the following aims: 1) Characterize genome-wide genotypes, including APOE genotypes, among older Arab Americans, whites and blacks from the same geographic area; 2) Determine whether differences in cognition, MCI and AD across older Arab Americans, whites and blacks is independent of APOE genotype; 3) Test for effect modification by race/ethnicity of the link between APOE genotype and cognitive health. This administrative supplement will fund the collection of currently-unavailable genotype data for a newly visible population in comparative perspective. Adding genetic measures to our pioneering study of social and behavioral factors in AD among Arab Americans, whites and blacks provides an innovative, cost effective opportunity to more fully identify health disparities, with special insights into the interplay between gene and social factors. The addition of genetics will substantially contribute to the comprehensive battery of cognitive and functional health thus permitting significant refinement of theory about AD risk in this growing and high-cost disease.

"Tau PET imaging in racially/ethnically diverse middle-aged adults PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most devastating international public health epidemics. There are currently no effective disease-modifying or preventative strategies. Current pathogenic models of AD emphasize a precipitating role of beta amyloid (Aβ) pathology, which stimulates tau deposition, neurodegeneration, and cognitive dysfunction. But recent work suggests that tau deposition frequently occurs prior to Aβ, could begin in midlife, and could be potentiated by other factors, including cerebrovascular disease. Tau pathology may play a role in AD racial/ethnic disparities, as the incidence and prevalence of AD is greater among African Americans and Hispanics, who have greater exposure to vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease. Thus, there are likely multiple pathways beginning in midlife that promote tau deposition and cognitive decline associated with AD, which may vary across racial/ethnic groups. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which tau deposition is related to cognitive function, to determine whether tau deposition varies across racial/ethnic groups, and to determine the extent to which cerebrovascular disease is associated with tau pathology in midlife. We will obtain tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging among 150 middle-aged adults who are receiving high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, Aβ PET, and comprehensive clinical evaluation as part of their participation in a study titled “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease” (RF1 AG054070, MPI: J.J. Manly/A.M. Brickman). The aims of the proposed project are: 1. To determine whether tau pathology is associated with cognitive functioning in midlife. We hypothesize that increased tau deposition in the medial temporal lobes will be associated with poorer episodic memory functioning and odor identification deficits. 2. To determine whether tau pathology differs across racial and ethnic groups in midlife. We hypothesize that Hispanics and African Americans will have greater amounts of tau pathology relative to non-Hispanic Whites. 3. To determine whether markers of cerebrovascular disease are associated with tau pathology in midlife and whether race/ethnicity moderates this association. We hypothesize that magnetic resonance imaging-derived markers of cerebrovascular disease, including white matter hyperintensities, infarcts, and microbleeds, will be associated with increased tau. We also expect that the relationship between markers of cerebrovascular disease and tau pathology will vary across racial/ethnic groups. Successful completion of this study will potentially point to novel intervention targets for the prevention of AD in addition to identifying sources of racial/ethnic disparities in the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and associated societal and economic burden is rising as the size of the elderly population continues to increase, yet the causes of this devastating disease are poorly understood. This project will examine the degree to which markers of AD pathology are associated with cognition in midlife and differences in AD biomarkers across racial/ethnic groups. It will also examine the role of cerebrovascular disease in promoting AD pathology to provide novel mechanistic insight into these disease and help identify new targets for intervention during

"Developing a Culturally-sensitive Volunteering Program to Reduce Stress of Dementia Caregivers in Chinese American Communities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Given the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States and the quickly growing population of older Chinese Americans, many older Chinese Americans are expected to need intensive care because of cognitive impairment. Few interventions have been designed to address caregiver needs among Chinese Americans, despite previous studies showing critical issues of poverty, low acculturation, and poor mental health in this population, the largest group of Asian Americans. A large gap exists in development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce stress among caregivers in Chinese American communities. This Research Career Development Award (K01) will give Dr. Liu the training, mentoring, and skills necessary to conduct intervention research to reduce the burden of dementia care among Chinese American families. The proposed mentored research activities for this K01 award involve developing and pilot testing a culturally sensitive intervention, the Peer Mentoring Program (PMP). Informed by the sociocultural stress and coping model, the PMP will build human resources among experiential Chinese caregivers to provide mentoring support for newer caregivers in the same ethnic community. This K01 application is responsive to NIA Research Goal E: “Improve our ability to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults.” It is also consistent with the National Alzheimer’s Project Act’s efforts to ensure receipt of culturally sensitive education, training, and support materials; involve more racially and ethnically diverse older adults in research; and develop effective services to support ethnically diverse families. To become an independent investigator in behavioral intervention research, Dr. Liu will receive training and mentoring in three areas: (a) knowledge of ADRD, interventions for caregivers, and dementia caregiving; (b) methodological skills to conduct community-based participatory research; and (c) theoretical and methodological skills to design and conduct scientifically rigorous intervention research. Mentored research training will occur in the context of a focused research project with three aims: (1) study the challenges and enablers of successful caregiving for persons with ADRD in the Chinese American communities of New York City; (2) develop a culturally sensitive volunteering intervention (PMP) to reduce stress and improve well-being of Chinese dementia caregivers; and (3) obtain preliminary data on feasibility and acceptability of the PMP. By the end of the K01 award, Dr. Liu will complete the transition from observational and explanatory to community-based intervention work and submit an R01 proposal and several manuscripts based on the study results for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The strong mentoring team, well-established collaborative relationships with community organizations in New York City, and marvelous academic resources at Columbia University will provide a supportive and enriching environment that will empower Dr. Liu to become a successful and independent investigator in behavioral intervention research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although many older Chinese Americans are expected to need intensive care because of cognitive impairment, a large gap exists in development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce stress among caregivers in Chinese American communities. This proposed project will develop and pilot test a culturally sensitive intervention, the peer mentoring program (PMP), which is informed by the sociocultural stress and coping model.

"Carolina Center on Alzheimer's Disease and Minority Research (CCADMR) OVERALL SECTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Due to its tremendous human and financial burden, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have risen to the forefront of the United States (U.S.) public health agenda. Older African Americans are at an increased likelihood of having ADRD. South Carolina has the highest age-adjusted death rate from ADRD in the U.S. A better understanding of the role that sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental determinants have on ADRD outcomes among African-American communities in the Southeast is critically and immediately needed. The overall goal of the proposed Carolina Center on Alzheimer’s Disease and Minority Research (CCADMR) is to increase the diversity of the research workforce focused on population health and determinants of ADRD disparities through sustained infrastructure that will support underrepresented and minority (URM) faculty focused on the health and well-being of minority elders. The Specific Aims of the proposed AD-RCMAR are to: (1) increase the capacity of URM scholars to advance the science on the sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence ADRD outcomes in order to reduce ADRD-related disparities, with a focus on African Americans, and (2) advance the science of ADRD research focused on population health and determinants of ADRD disparities through research education in population-based, secondary data analysis, interdisciplinary co-mentoring teams, well-established strategies for recruitment of AD-RCMAR Scientists, and education on Health Disparities and Minority Aging Research. The proposed CCADMR is a state-wide collaboration, providing mentorship and education on determinants of ADRD disparities using population-based datasets for URM faculty throughout South Carolina, at the three major research institutions, including University of South Carolina (UofSC), Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), and Clemson University (CU), and three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including Allen University, Claflin University, and South Carolina State University. Interdisciplinary and partner-engaged research, with which the principal investigators (PIs) and research team have expertise, will be an effective strategy for addressing ADRD-related disparities. The proposed Center leverages the multiple PIs’ extensive leadership in providing critical training in aging and ADRD for URM Scientists and their research expertise in cognitive aging, minority health, and ADRD disparities. The PIs and Core Leads are well-established and collaborative scholars with substantial mentoring experience and content knowledge that will contribute to the success of the proposed CCADMR.

"Midcareer Investigator Award for Patient-Oriented Research in Dementia and Serious Illness Project Summary / Abstract Background: Healthcare spending is highly concentrated among a small seriously ill population. Yet, most high-cost patients are not in the last year of life and, despite high spending, quality of care for this group is often low, marked by poor communication, high burden of pain and other symptoms, and preference- discordant treatments. A key subset of this seriously ill population, persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, may experience the greatest burden of serious illness due to dementia's long course of illness, progressive functional impairment, and high degree of caregiver strain, the impact of which is often magnified among vulnerable and underserved subgroups. These issues are not well characterized over the course of illness and very little is known about the experience of those with both dementia and another serious illness, such as cancer or heart failure. Only by examining patient and families' experiences prospectively and over time can we begin to understand how these patterns are associated with patient care quality and family outcomes and thus appropriately target the interventions needed to improve care. Aims: Over the award period, I aim to expand my research and mentoring program by 1) building an innovative prospectively-framed sample, identified at onset of dementia, to examine patient and family outcomes (i.e., hospital and emergency department admissions, burdensome transitions, nursing home admission, and exhaustion of household wealth) over time; and 2) examining within this sample, differences in these patient and family outcomes between those with dementia compared to those who also have another serious illness (e.g., cancer). In both aims, we will also examine differences across vulnerable subgroups. Methods: Working in parallel across two nationally-representative, longitudinal cohorts, the Health and Retirement Study and the National Health and Aging Trends Study, linked to individual-level Medicare claims, we will identify incident dementia and other serious illnesses. By anchoring to the first observed date of illness, we will construct a longitudinal person-level dataset, including rich patient and family reported measures as well as healthcare claims. We will then use these data to examine the experiences and outcomes of older adults with dementia, with or without another serious illness, over time and also investigate disparities across vulnerable social and demographic subgroups. Public Health Significance: Older adults with dementia and other serious illnesses and their families are at risk for suffering due to low-quality, high-cost care, yet little prospective data on their experiences exist. This project will examine the longitudinal experience of those with dementia and their families beginning with the onset of dementia, and compare these experiences to those with another serious illness, such as cancer or heart failure. This study will also serve as a platform for mentoring junior investigators.

"Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Core Center Overall – Project Summary  This application proposes a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSOM) to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD. Our Center will provide innovative resources to examine the contributions of metabolic and vascular factors to early phase transitions from normal aging to MCI and then to AD and other dementias, through coordinated research spanning the translational spectrum. Wake Forest is uniquely equipped to rapidly develop a high-impact ADCC because it has: 1) a deep, interdisciplinary foundation in aging research; 2) specialized expertise in metabolic and vascular factors and their relationship to cognitive aging and dementia; 3) strong ties to an ethnically diverse community with high prevalence of dementia and metabolic/vascular disorders; and 4) exceptional institutional support. The rationale for our theme is based on research showing that metabolic and vascular disorders are highly prevalent, modifiable factors that contribute to the transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias. To promote innovative translational research focused on these factors, the ADCC will enroll an observational multi-ethnic cohort from an existing 15-year study of metabolic/vascular risk, and leverage their extensive data by adding key endpoints to characterize AD and other dementias. The Clinical Core will enroll a separate cohort enriched for metabolic/vascular risk, along with participants with AD. The ADCC will focus on African-American (AA) and other underserved groups who are twice as likely to develop AD, and have high rates of diabetes and vascular disease. Specialized resources will be available to ADCC investigators, including non-human primate (NHP) models for translational research. A repository of human and NHP biospecimens, genetic/epigenetic data, and extensive clinical data will be available to NACC, NCRAD, and other investigators. The ADCC will also serve as a resource for a broad spectrum of AD initiatives. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Establish a comprehensive integrated research infrastructure focused on phase transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias, and provide special resources to accelerate research on metabolic and vascular factors; 2) Optimize the participation of AA adults to better understand the causes underlying their increased risk of AD and dementia; 3) Expand relationships with the national ADCC network and key affiliates such as NACC and NCRAD; 4) Provide training in translational research to new investigators, and education regarding AD and dementia to professionals, patients and families, and the community. The prevalence of metabolic and vascular risk factors, their importance to AD expression, the strengths of the Wake Forest scientific community in these research areas, and our outstanding institutional commitment are indicators that NIH funding will be successfully leveraged to establish an ADCC that will make high-impact contributions to the field. Overall – Project Narrative  This application seeks to establish a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine that will provide a comprehensive infrastructure for translational, interdisciplinary research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD and related disorders. Our ADCC will focus on the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and then to AD and other dementias, and understanding the contribution of metabolic and vascular factors to these transitions. The ADCC will enroll a diverse group of ~1,000 adults to facilitate the discovery of new biomarkers and promising targets for prevention and therapy. We will also utilize novel nonhuman primate models to promote pivotal mechanistic and translational research.

To fill this gap, we seek to enhance the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UCD ADC), which contains a diverse ethnoracial cohort (having Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic White decedents), through implementation of digital pathology within our Neuropathology Core. This implementation will allow for rapid transmission of pathological data for consultation and collaborations, distribution of materials for educational purposes, tissue specimen archiving, and image analysis. In addition, by having a digital pathology with immunofluorescent capabilities will allow for viewing of the distribution (including overlap) of multiple proteins at one time within a tissue specimen. This can enhance biological studies by providing spatial relationships of proteins resulting in a deeper phenotype of disease. This supplement application is designed to support equipment and leverage and enhance infrastructure to allow the UCD ADC the ability to 1) purchase a whole slide image system to digitize existing and future histologically stained samples 2) leverage and enhance current servers and database systems to allow for storage and rapid retrieval of digital images and their data and 3) leverage and enhance hardware to develop and deploy pipelines for quantitative computational methodologies for pathologies found within a diverse ethnoracial cohort of Alzheimer’s disease brains. The UCD ADC continues to excel and expand in its research initiatives to collect and provide brain specimens and pathological data on a diverse population of individuals at various stages of cognitive ability and dementia risk. This supplement will further enable suitable infrastructure for enhancement of current collaborations and facilitate emerging collaborations by providing a means to share and analysis pathology on digitized whole slide images. PROJECT NARRATIVE Digital microscopy paired with machine learning algorithms has aided in diagnosis and provide more quantitative pathology data to unlock the secrets of diseases. These technologies are needed within the dementia field, specifically in diverse cohorts, as disease presentations may differ. By implementing state of the art imaging systems and analysis, the goals of this supplement are to enhance the ADC’s ability to provide greater access to high quality pathological data for educational, consultation and collaborative purposes, infrastructure to pursue digital solutions for more quantitative analysis, and safe secure storage of histologic specimens.",UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center,9852188,P30AG010129,"['Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Archives ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Consultations ', ' relational database management systems ', ' database systems ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Equipment ', ' Future ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Modernization ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Glean ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Slide ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' beta pleated sheet ', ' β-pleated sheet ', ' β-Sheet ', ' Beta Sheet ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Thioflavin S ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Retrieval ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Pathologic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' disease phenotype ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' spatial relationship ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' cognitive ability ', ' imaging system ', ' histological stains ', ' histologic stains ', ' histological specimens ', ' histology specimens ', ' histology samples ', ' histological samples ', ' data resource ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' digital pathology ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2019,289154,0.1257430453665051
"Nonlinear Models of Cognition Preceding AD and non-AD in a Biracial Population Sample This proposal aims to conduct secondary analyses of existing data to examine nonlinear cognitive decline in standardized global summary of cognition assessed using executive functioning, episodic memory, and overall global cognition and orientation within the context of a large population-based study of older adults: Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). More specifically, the four objectives of this proposal are: 1) Examine Nonlinear Cognitive Decline in Older Blacks and Whites Using Change Point Models in a Random Sample of 2,948 Participants with AD and non-AD Diagnosis; 2) investigate the Role of Demographic, Social, Lifestyle, Cardiovascular, and Genetic Risk Factors on Nonlinear Cognitive Decline in Older Blacks and Whites with AD and non-AD Diagnosis; 3) Identify the Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Cognitive Decline Using Latent Class Growth Curve Models Using a Population Sample of 7,757 Blacks and Whites with Multiple Cognitive Assessments; 4) Understand the Role of Demographic, Social, Lifestyle, Cardiovascular, and Genetic Risk Factors on Latent Class Memberships to Explain Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Cognitive Decline. Understanding the rate of cognitive decline in older blacks and whites has a topic of considerable interest. However, most research has focused on linear trajectories in whites with mixed findings among blacks. Nonlinear cognitive decline based on change points are nonexistent in blacks and the proposed work can increase our understanding of preclinical phase of AD and non-AD. Description: This proposal aims to conduct a secondary data analysis to study the nonlinear changes in cognitive function using change point models for decline preceding AD and non-AD and the covariate effects of five sets of risk factors, namely, demographic, social, lifestyle, cardiovascular, and genetic on nonlinear cognitive decline. The study also proposed the use of latent class growth curve models to examine the heterogeneity in population- level cognition and nonlinear cognitive decline in a population-based longitudinal study of older adults. This proposal is based on a longitudinal cohort of 7,757 older adults who were followed for about 19 years with data collection done every 3 years for cognitive assessments. The clinical diagnosis of AD and non-AD is available on 2,948 participants who were sampled using a stratified random sample.

"Study of Aging Latinas/os for Understanding Dementia in HIV (SALUD HIV) HIV remains a major public health problem, particularly for the Latina/o population. US-dwelling Latinas/os are at increased risk for HIV-infection compared to non-Hispanic whites, and suffer a disproportionate burden of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), which may be amplified with age. HIV-infected (HIV+) Latinas/os of Caribbean origin have the highest prevalence of HAND (~70%) of any racial/ethnic group in the US (HIV+ Mexican Americans: 44%; African Americans: ~40%, & non-Hispanic whites: ~40%). Older HIV+ Latinas/os (50± years) appear to be at even greater risk for HAND and cognitive decline than their non- Hispanic white counterparts. Moreover, the pattern of cognitive impairment in HAND appears to differ by ethnicity. In the general HIV population, HAND is characterized by impairments in processing speed, attention, and executive functioning consistent with involvement of the frontostriatal circuitry. In contrast, HIV+ Caribbean Latinas/os present a more amnestic profile with impaired learning and memory consistent with involvement of the medial temporal lobe circuitry. Despite these important disparities, differing cognitive profiles and possible differences in affected neural structures, the literature on HAND in Latinas/os is almost entirely cross-sectional, does not include HIV-uninfected (HIV-) controls, lacks any studies focused on brain integrity in this population, and has yet to examine the mechanisms underlying these disparities. Utilizing a biopsychosociocultural theoretical framework, the overarching goals of this study are to investigate whether older HIV+ Latinas/os of Caribbean origin demonstrate accelerated neurosenescence and different patterns of decline in cognitive function and brain integrity compared to other groups, and to uncover the biological (e.g., genetic predisposition [apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele], inflammatory biomarkers, cardiovascular burden) and sociocultural (e.g., social adversity, discrimination, stress) mechanisms conferring risk for neurodegenerative and cognitive changes in this population. To that end, this multidisciplinary study will deploy a longitudinal observational design with 110 HIV+ and 110 HIV-matched control adults (both groups will include: 70% Latina/o and 30% non-Hispanic white; 50% younger [21-45 yrs] and 50% older [60-80 yrs] over 36-months. All participants will complete laboratory, neuromedical, multimodal neuroimaging, and comprehensive cognitive and sociocultural assessments. Addressing dementia and HAND health disparities in Latinas/os is vital to: 1) improve our understanding of biological and sociocultural aspects of neurosenescence through the lens of HIV infection; 2) advance dementia research in other conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease [AD] & related dementias) by offering greater understanding of sociocultural variations in the neuropathogenesis of dementia; and 3) inform culturally-relevant and targeted interventions that could lead to better Latina/o cognitive and health outcomes in HIV and other chronic conditions that disproportionately burden this population. This work could also provide a framework for studying and addressing HAND in Latin American countries that also bear a heavy HIV burden.

"Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research ABSTRACT Despite experiencing Alzheimer’s-related health problems at a disproportionate rate, African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Insufficient enrollment of African Americans in this line of research is a nationally-recognized problem. This is highly concerning not only because of the need for unbiased, representative samples in basic science and clinical research, but also because involving persons from underrepresented minority groups is crucial to advancing our understanding of, and ultimately combating, health disparities. In response to PAR-15- 349 “Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease”, we propose to develop and evaluate a novel strategy that uses a storytelling campaign to enhance recruitment of African American adults into research at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center. In Specific Aim 1, we will build on our promising pilot work to refine and evaluate community members’ acceptance of a storytelling strategy for communicating Alzheimer’s-related research participation experiences of African Americans in mid and late life. The storytelling strategy will highlight African Americans’ research participation narratives, as derived from a series of ethnographic interviews and told using short videos. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the effect of this storytelling strategy on recruitment of African Americans into ADRD research. Videos developed in Aim 1 will be incorporated into all existing ADRC recruitment efforts, ranging from community events to social media strategies. The primary outcome for Aim 2 will be the proportion of African Americans recruited to the ADRC Clinical Core over an 18 month period, with the preceding 18 month period serving as the comparator. Specific Aim 3 will use path analysis modeling to explore the mechanisms by which a storytelling strategy increases enrollment of African Americans into ADRD research in general, and into a specific study designed to address health disparities. Realizing the goals of this study will increase racial and ethnic diversity in ADRD research at a leading NIA-funded ADRC and ultimately, help to reduce cognitive health disparities amongst African Americans. Findings from this study will directly inform best practices for increasing diversity within the national AD Centers network, with significant implications for a range of underrepresented populations. Furthermore, these findings will also have applications in other disease contexts in which scientific progress is constrained by insufficient recruitment of persons from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups. This project will examine how a strategy called storytelling may help to increase research participation among persons of African American ethnicity. The project will focus on recruitment to research studies related to Alzheimer’s disease, which is particularly important because 1) Alzheimer’s poses a substantial threat to public health, 2) African Americans experience Alzheimer’s-related health problems at disproportionately high rates compared to non-Hispanic whites, and 3) , African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Findings from this study will inform best practices for recruitment throughout the NIA-funded national network of Alzheimer Disease Research Centers, and resources developed through this project will be shared accordingly.",Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research,9692668,R01AG054518,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' health economics ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' combat ', ' primary outcome ', ' social media ', ' Caregiver support ', ' Care giver support ', ' dementia care ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' relative cost ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,605159,0.10309370202789803
"Integrative Genomic Approaches for Understanding Sex Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Women make up nearly two-thirds of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases in the United States and these differences are likely due to contributions from differential genetic and environmental effects between the sexes. While several candidate gene studies have identified sex-specific associations, no large-scale, genome- wide, sex-specific association analysis of AD has been conducted. Furthermore, the functional underpinnings of sex-specific genetic associations and how they relate to expression and epigenetic variations, are still largely unknown. We hypothesize that multiple genetic, epigenetic and gene-expression changes operate in a sex-specific manner to explain at least part of the sex disparity in AD prevalence. To this end, we propose new strategies for integrative analysis of DNA variants, gene expression, splicing and DNA methylation in a sex- aware framework, which will allow us to prioritize variants with the most regulatory potential and provide additional insight into the biological mechanisms of sex differences in AD. To accomplish these goals we will leverage existing large-scale genetic data from several consortia studies in AD, as well as expression and methylation data from brain tissue of AD cases and healthy individuals. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the sex-specific genetic architecture of AD through association and genetic correlation analysis; 2) Conduct transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify sex-specific changes relevant to AD; 3) Conduct region-centric analysis to identify sex-specific DNA methylation changes that contribute to AD; and 4) Prioritize sex-specific loci and develop sex-specific polygenic risk scores for AD through integrative analysis. Successful completion of this project will deliver the first large scale sex-specific genome-wide analysis of AD. It will also provide a paradigm for comprehensive and integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in a sex-aware framework. By focusing on integrative analysis of multiple types of `omics data, our study will provide a more complete understanding of the genetic and epigenetic programs underlying sex differences in AD, which will lead to better prevention, diagnosis and individualized treatment strategies. Project Narrative Women are approximately twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men.

"Arterial Stiffness and Brain Health in African Americans Cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are pressing public health concerns as the population ages. In the U.S., African Americans have a high risk of ADRD compared with other population groups; however, factors explaining this disparity are unknown. Greater central arterial stiffness is posited to alter microvasculature structure and function in the brain, contributing to cerebral small vessel disease, cognitive impairment, and risk of ADRD. No reports to date have examined these associations in a large, well-characterized African American population. Similarly, the salient roles of sex, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension in these associations have not been addressed, although African Americans have a high burden of cardiometabolic risk factors and hypertension that are associated with both greater arterial stiffness and risk of ADRD. We propose to examine these gaps in an ancillary study to the 2020-2022 Exam 4 of ~2,700 participants, ages 41-104 years, in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an ongoing and deeply phenotyped cohort of African Americans. We propose to add pulse wave velocity, a non-invasive arterial stiffness measurement, to all participants during Exam 4. All other data will be available from JHS and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS). To evaluate temporal change in arterial stiffness, we will leverage existing arterial stiffness measures from those who also participated in the ARIC-NCS Visit 5 (2011- 2013, N=1,078). The study aims are the following: Aim 1. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and the burden of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, subcortical infarcts, and markers of brain atrophy. Aim 2. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and domain-specific cognitive function. Aim 3. Characterize the 8-year change in central arterial stiffness and its association with the burden of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, subcortical infarcts, and brain volumes at Exam 4 among older adults in participants in both the ARIC-NCS and JHS studies. For all aims, we will evaluate sex, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension as potential effect modifiers. This cost-efficient ancillary study will, for the first time, contribute information on the association of central arterial stiffness and brain structure and function in a large sample of African Americans, a population exposed to high levels of hypertension and metabolic impairments and at risk for ADRD. The inclusion of middle-aged adults and measures of cerebral small vessel disease, cerebral infarcts, and impaired cognitive function will provide insights into opportunities for intervention prior to onset of cognitive impairment or overt ADRD. Understanding how arterial stiffness influences brain health will contribute novel information toward reducing health disparities and promoting cognitive resilience. This study is focused on the stiffening of the arteries and the associated structural damage to small vessels in the brain and reduced cognitive function that precede cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. We propose to add a measure of artery stiffness to the 2020-2022 re-examination of the Jackson Heart Study; information on risk factors, damage to small vessels in the brain and cognitive performance will come from the existing study and as well as measures of artery stiffness in subset of participants that also participated in the 2011-2013 visit of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities- Neurocognitive study. This study will provide new information on how stiffening of the arteries relate to brain structure and function in African Americans that can inform efforts to reduce health disparities and to identify potential targets to lower the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",Arterial Stiffness and Brain Health in African Americans,9712169,R01AG062488,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' cerebral infarct ', ' Cerebral Infarction ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' insight ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Lacunar Infarctions ', ' lacunar stroke ', ' lacunar infarcts ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' processing speed ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' artery stiffness ', ' artery stiffening ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' brain volume ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' resilience ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' high risk ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' brain health ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ', ' recruit ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,653972,0.14002587267173489
"MyCog - Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings Cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia are significant public health burdens that can have profound social and emotional effects on older adults. Early detection of CI is imperative in order to identify potentially treatable underlying causal conditions, and in cases where cure is not possible, to provide supportive services to minimize the effects of CI. While primary care and other clinical settings are ideal places for identifying CI, it frequently goes undetected. Available screening tools may be unsuitable for implementation in such settings because of their length, cost, or need for specialized equipment or highly trained administrators. Our project, MyCog: Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings, will create a brief, readily available, standard set of CI screening measures applicable for use in diverse settings and with diverse populations. Comprised of two cognitive measures drawn from the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function® and the Everyday Cognition self- and informant-report measures and implemented as a downloadable app, MyCog will be validated in a large sample of older adults (ages 65+) enrolled in “LitCog III: Health Literacy and Cognitive Function among Older Adults”. Field testing MyCog within LitCog III will allow validation in multiple clinical workflows and in African-Americans, a health disparities population. Our proposed project will 1) Create a standalone MyCog App using existing NIHTB cognition tests and Everyday Cognition self-/proxy report measures that will report screening results as either “No CI detected”, or `CI detected” and provide follow-up recommendations and guidelines for each outcome; 2) Validate MyCog (UH3 Phase) in primary care settings and determine its sensitivity in detecting early indicators of CI using an existing cohort (LitCog III) of well-characterized, ethnically and racially diverse adults ages 65- 85; 3) Evaluate the success of MyCog clinical implementation in primary care settings; 4) Optimize MyCog for use in clinical settings by adjusting scoring algorithms to maximize efficiency and incorporating features that facilitate clinical integration; and 5) if selected to do so, coordinate consortium-wide activities. Cognitive impairment (CI) is increasing in the US as our elderly population increases, and therefore early detection of CI is critical for ensuring its appropriate management. This project will create a brief CI screening battery (the MyCog App), available in English and Spanish versions, that can be easily implemented in everyday clinical settings with diverse populations. MyCog, comprised of existing measures of cognitive function, will be validated in a large, general population sample of elderly individuals, including many African Americans and people with low socioeconomic status who are at increased risk of experiencing health disparities.",MyCog - Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings,9765425,UH3NS105562,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Americas ', ' Cognition ', ' Equipment ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' processing speed ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes ', ' LOINC ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' rapid detection ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' implantation ', ' usability ', ' primary care setting ', ' standard measure ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' clinical implementation ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,UH3,2019,1263250,0.02189676239387307
"Building Relationships between Researchers and the Community to Increase African American Participation in Alzheimer's Disease Research Project Summary Abstract African Americans and other racial and ethnic minority groups remain underrepresented in aging research, despite increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). In light of the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of the aging population, the NIH has prioritized the recruitment and retention of individuals from marginalized populations in AD research programs, with the goal of increasing inclusivity of research participant pools, a critical aspect of effectively addressing future healthcare needs. Many studies indicate that African Americans are interested and willing to participate in research, but there are multiple complicating factors impeding full participation. The challenge for AD researchers is to develop research programs in which older African Americans are able to and feel comfortable participating. Successful programs address community-based and institutional barriers to recruitment, as well as prioritize increased collaboration, sensitivity, and responsiveness to the various cultural needs of participants from these groups. Previously, we designed a culturally-tailored service-based approach to improve the recruitment and retention of African Americans into the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). The long-term goal of this strategy is to increase engagement of African Americans in AD research by establishing a lasting community presence and positive, collaborative relationships through the provision of research-sponsored community programs. In the current proposal, using mixed methodology, we plan to 1) assess the impact of this strategy on overall attitudes towards research participation, and 2) conduct structured interviews to collect qualitative data identifying additional factors and key elements influencing research participation. Increasing the generalizability of findings through building more inclusive AD research participant pools is the first step in achieving the ultimate goal of eliminating health disparities and providing the highest level of care to all. Information gained will used to be used to refine the current program and support the establishment of other service-based recruitment and retention programs. Project Narrative The proposed study assesses research perceptions and the impact of a service-based model of recruitment on the participation of African Americans adults 45 and older. Understanding key factors supporting participation is critical to increasing the inclusivity of dementia research, and achieving equity in prevention and treatment.",Building Relationships between Researchers and the Community to Increase African American Participation in Alzheimer's Disease Research,9738273,R03AG063304,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attitude ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Wisconsin ', ' County ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' community organizations ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' control trial ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Relationship-Building ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R03,2019,165135,0.10345107676843844
"Characterizing disparities in late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk through polygenic risk and epidemiologic factors in the Health and Retirement Survey PROJECT SUMMARY Late-onset Alzheimer's dementia (LOAD) is terminal and the most prevalent form of dementia (70% of cases). LOAD is a major public health burden in the US with current prevalence estimates of 4 to 5 million adults and economic costs exceeding $236 billion annually. Important disparities in LOAD prevalence occur with sex, race/ethnicity, education, and residence. The biological bases of these health disparities are incompletely characterized and their influences on LOAD are likely to be multifactorial. Thus, studies with sufficient sample sizes, concurrently assessing multiple characteristics, such as educational attainment, environment, social, behavioral, lifestyle, geographic, and genetics, will be uniquely positioned to effectively test factors or combinations of factors that create and sustain LOAD disparities. Our goal is to determine the joint genetic and environmental contributions to LOAD risk that underlie these health disparities. Using existing genomics data, well-characterized dementia phenotypes, and diverse risk factor data, we will analyze up to 16,000 aging participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), attempt clinical confirmation in participants of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) sub-cohort of the HRS, and test replication in other clinical and population-based samples. Our aims are to (1) determine the cumulative genetic risk of LOAD by testing the association between cognitive polygenic scores and risk of dementia phenotype in European and African ancestries; (2) determine the polygenic effect of LOAD risk covariates from behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial domains on dementia phenotypes in European and African ancestries; and (3) test for effect modification of the association between polygenic risk and dementia phenotype in European and African ancestries by health disparities factors (sex, education, urban/rural residence). This study will likely impact the field of Alzheimer's research and contribute to public health because it will a) establish the relevance of cumulative genetic risk on LOAD in susceptible populations where genetics may be a more relevant factor; b) elucidate important biological mechanisms through polygenic scores; c) determine the combined and individual gene-environment contribution to LOAD risk; d) generate unified polygenic scores and dementia phenotypes across major longitudinal cohorts involving diverse populations that can be used in future investigations of health outcomes and/or additional exposure domains; e) consider the effects of sex, educational attainment, ancestry, and urban/rural status in the same study where comparisons of relative contribution to risk can be made. We have the opportunity to simultaneously and significantly improve our understanding of the genetic and environmental etiologic contributions to health disparities in LOAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall purpose of this proposal is to establish the relevance of polygenic risk in susceptibility to dementia, particularly among groups at increased risk of disease, including women, minorities, rural inhabitants, and those with low educational attainment. Because an individual's susceptibility to dementia is likely a combination of genetics and environmental risk factors, we will jointly test the effects of cumulative genetic risk and dementia risk factors in our analysis. The proposal provides an opportunity to identify a genetic etiologic component in vulnerable groups that could lead to mechanistic understanding or targeted interventions to substantially benefit

"Incident Vascular Brain Injury, Probable Alzheimer's Disease, and Cognitive Change in Elderly American Indians PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A workshop convened in 2013 by National Institute of Aging and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke prioritized research on cognitive impairment of multiple etiologies, contributions of vascular brain injury (VBI) to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and disparities involving race, ethnicity, socioeconomics, and rural residence. VBI is a leading cause of accelerated brain aging and a major risk factor for stroke, cognitive decline, depression, and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few studies have evaluated VBI, cognitive impairment, and AD in American Indians (AIs), who bear a heavy burden of risk factors for these conditions. This exclusion is unfortunate, since the distinctive history, risk profiles, environmental stressors, social environments, and healthcare systems of AIs likely result in patterns of disease that differ substantially from other populations. Our research team has conducted the only cohort study to date of covert VBI in AIs. In 2010-2013, Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians study completed standardized clinical examinations, neuropsychological testing, and cranial MRI on more than 1,000 AIs aged 64-95 years from 10 tribes in 3 states. In 2016, we began re-examination of surviving participants using the same protocols, augmented by assessment for probable AD. However, the particular grant mechanism from the National Institute on Aging that provides funding for this follow-up examination is limited to data collection, with no resources allocated for analysis. In this proposal, we will capitalize on the accumulated longitudinal data to apply sophisticated imaging and analysis methods to quantify and evaluate associations for incident VBI, neurodegeneration, and changes in cognitive status in this elderly minority population. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) establish normative and diagnostic standards for mild cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly AIs, and evaluate associations and determinants for incident VBI, cerebral atrophy, cognitive decline, and probable AD; (2) conduct cluster analyses to identify novel neuroimaging profiles that predict subgroups of elderly AIs at highest risk for cerebral atrophy, cognitive decline, and probable AD; and (3) complete a rigorous career development plan that will position the applicant as an independent investigator and leader in innovative neuroepidemiology research with minority populations. This proposal leverages a timely opportunity to generate the first population-based estimates of and address novel scientific questions on VBI and cognitive impairment in AIs, a minority population with pervasive health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE American Indians bear a disproportionate burden of the complications of cardiovascular risk, which may cause damage to the brain and result in cognitive impairment. In addition, little is known about other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, in this group. We will establish the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes related to new onset of these conditions, and of problems in memory, concentration, and thinking among American Indians residing across three regions of the US.","Incident Vascular Brain Injury, Probable Alzheimer's Disease, and Cognitive Change in Elderly American Indians",9736444,K01AG057821,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older

"Risk Factors for Stroke and Cognitive Decline in a Tri-Ethnic Region ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke, cognitive impairment and dementia are increasing public health problems with a disproportionate impact on blacks and Hispanics. The National Alzheimer's Project Act and the NIH have recommended more extensive studies on the risk and determinants of dementia in disparities populations. Elucidation of the relationships between traditional and novel vascular risk factors for stroke, dementia, cognitive impairment, and disability is critical to enhance our ability to modify the risk of these conditions. The Northern Manhattan Study consists of a population-based cohort of 3497 stroke-free adults who have been followed annually for a median of 13.9 years. This collaborative prospective cohort study among whites, blacks, and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community is an outstanding resource to address health disparities involving faculty across three institutions (Columbia University, University of Miami, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). The cohort is well characterized and the 1290 subjects among the MRI sub-cohort have had a standardized brain MRI and two neuropsychological assessments over 5 years. The new aims are to determine the relationship between cognitive trajectories and a novel neuro-immune and inflammatory biomarker panel; determine the relationship between brain imaging biomarkers (regional brain volumes, regional white matter lesion burden, hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, small dilated perivascular spaces, dolichoectasia) and cognitive trajectories and dementia; determine the risk and vascular determinants of dementia; characterize the vascular determinants of functional impairment, disability, and quality of life; and assess the relationship between novel risk factors and specific ischemic stroke subtypes. To accomplish these aims, subjects will continue to be followed annually by telephone to ascertain stroke, MI, death and change in cognitive status, and more extensive functional assessments will be collected. A third expanded in-person neuropsychological assessment will be done among the MRI subcohort and a dementia consensus conference will ascertain and classify dementia. Stored plasma at the time of MRI will be used to measure an innovative inflammatory and immune biomarker panel, and new MRI measures will be analyzed on the already collected brain MRIs. The strengths of this prospective cohort study are the wealth of baseline data already assembled, the tri-ethnic composition residing in the same community, the outstanding follow-up record, the evaluation of novel serum biomarkers and brain imaging biomarkers, and the expanded focus on comprehensive outcomes including cognitive trajectories, dementia, functional impairment, and ischemic stroke subtypes. The results of these studies will be instrumental in the design of intervention programs to prevent stroke and cognitive decline in diverse populations and be a valuable shared data resource. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and dementia are increasing public health problems with a larger impact on blacks and Hispanics. Results from studying new blood and brain imaging factors will be instrumental in proposing interventions to prevent stroke and dementia in minority populations.",Risk Factors for Stroke and Cognitive

"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve access and engagement in AD research among disadvantaged groups.",Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research,9770763,K76AG060005,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Terminology ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' care episode ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Exclusion ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' ICD-10 ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' AD detection ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' Alzheimer screening ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' screening ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K76,2019,236075,0.13662078724809545
"Rhythm Experience and Africana Culture Trial (REACT) Abstract  African Americans are almost two times more likely than whites (i.e., Caucasians) to experience Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. For those over the age of 65, the prevalence of cognitive impairment is 8.8% in whites and 23.9% in African Americans. Even in the age range of 55-64, African Americans are 4 times more likely to experience cognitive impairment than their age-matched white counterparts. Increased risk of dementia among African Americans may be attributed to lower levels and quality of education, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and higher prevalence of vascular diseases, Type II diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, all of which are recognized as risk factors for dementia. A critical public health question emerges from these statistics that we intend to address in this proposal: Is there an effective method for reducing or eliminating the race disparities in cognitive and brain health? Fortunately, physical activity (PA) interventions may be effective at improving neurocognitive function and reducing risk for dementia. Despite these promising results, prior PA interventions have had few African Americans making it difficult to stratify results by race to determine whether African Americans respond to PA in a similar manner and magnitude as whites. In addition, the terms `physical activity' and `exercise' are often considered unpleasant, painful, and fatiguing, which can negatively influence interest, enrollment, and long-term adherence. Methods that increase PA without using the term PA (e.g., dancing) could be effective at improving health outcomes while simultaneously having a wider impact on translation and long- term adherence. Here we propose an innovative and culturally sensitive method of increasing PA in older (60- 80 yrs) African Americans. We propose a randomized intervention where 180 older African Americans are assigned to either a moderate intensity African Dance group 3 days per week (N=90) or to an African Education group 3 days per week (N=90) for 6-months. Both before and at the completion of the intervention, we will collect a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and MRI metrics of brain health and function to identify biological pathways by which PA influences neurocognitive health in an African American population. This proposal has the potential to utilize community-based activities to improve health of older African Americans. In addition, it could establish a platform (i.e., dance) to implement future interventions targeting minority populations to reduce health disparities. We have three primary aims: Aim 1. Examine whether a 6- month African Dance intervention improves cognitive performance compared to an educational control group. Aim 2. Examine whether African Dance influences brain morphology, task-evoked neural responses, cerebral blood flow, and resting state connectivity. Aim 3. Explore potential physiological and socioemotional mechanisms of the dance intervention. We will collect measures of physical and psychosocial health such as waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, mood, anxiety, depression, and loneliness and examine whether intervention-related changes to these measures mediate improvements in cognitive performance. Narrative In this randomized clinical trial, we will examine the effects of African Dance and Africana Education on cognitive and brain function in older African Americans. We will be collecting a battery of cognitive, neuroimaging, psychosocial, physical function measures, and blood-based biomarkers to examine the outcomes and mechanisms of the intervention.",Rhythm

"Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (DAD) for Longitudinal Aging Study of India (LASI) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): India, the second-most populous country in the world, will soon experience rapid aging of its population. By 2050, India's older population (> 60 years old) is projected to reach 320 million (about the current size of the entire US population), representing an increase from 8 to 20 percent of its total population. The growing number of older people will drive a large increase in the prevalence of dementia in India, far exceeding the capacity of the private care system that currently predominates for the elderly. The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), a survey of 50,000 Indians representative of the older population across the nation and within its states and union territories, provides a unique opportunity to examine this and related issues. LASI is the most ambitious nationally representative study of the physical, mental, economic, and social well-being of the country's older population. Harmonized with other Health and Retirement Study (HRS) surveys, it offers an evidence base that can be used to compare the effects of social policies aimed at supporting older persons in India with policies used in other countries around the world. The objective of the proposed research is to supplement the current LASI in order to estimate the prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in India. Previous efforts to identify dementia in developing nations have typically relied on non- representative samples in geographically restricted regions. In this application, we aim to develop a protocol for the assessment of dementia and MCI to be used within community settings in the ongoing, nationally representative LASI. To do so, we will first conduct in-depth cognitive testing for a sub-sample of LASI respondents at regional geriatric hospitals in India. Specifically, we will administer two leading dementia assessment protocols - the HRS Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) and the 10/66 Dementia Protocol - to approximately 2,000 respondents at least 60 years of age and stratified by their Wave 1 cognition test results, as well as their proximity to collaborating regional geriatic hospitals where the assessments will occur. Based on prognostic evaluation of the protocols, we will develop a short (15-minute) dementia assessment module and administer it in Wave 2 to persons with a high probability of having dementia and MCI as well as to the 2,000 persons participating in the earlier assessment. Using these data, we will estimate prevalence rates of dementia and MCI in India for the population and sub-populations. We will provide to the research community data generated from the in-depth cognitive testing at regional geriatric hospitals and from the administration of the short dementia assessment module during Wave 2, both linked to the on-going LASI main survey. Our harmonized protocol for dementia and MCI assessment will enable researchers to make comparisons with prior findings in India using the 10/66 protocol as well as to conduct cross-country studies with the United States, England, China, and other countries that implement the HRS HCAP protocol.

"Dementia and Physical Disablement Processes among Aging Latinos Dementia and Physical Disablement Processes among Aging Latinos Project Summary The Latino population is rapidly aging and by 2050 will represent over 20% of the older adult population in the U.S. At the same time, the burden of dementia in the older Latino population is expected to increase from around 200,000 cases in 2000 to as many as 1.3 million cases in 2050, with many more suffering from milder degrees of cognitive impairment. A further stress on the Latino and specifically Mexican-origin population is high poverty rates. Close to 27% of older Mexican Americans in the U.S. live below the poverty line which is over double the rate for older adults in general (Administration for Community Living, 2014). Disparities in dementia raise serious public health concerns; yet, there have been surprisingly few longitudinal studies on the role of dementia and cognitive impairment for physical disablement processes in the Mexican-origin population. Understanding how dementia shapes physical disablement pathways and identifying factors that slow down or speed up disablement will lead to a better understanding at which point geriatric public health intervention is most needed. We propose to employ a longitudinal cohort study of 3,050 older Mexican-origin individuals the 1993/94-2016/17 Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (H-EPESE). First, we will use nine waves of survey data to 1) describe the long-term patterns of dementia and cognitive impairment for a prospective cohort of older Mexican Americans. Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) is used for this part of the analysis. Then, we will 2) estimate the role of dementia and cognitive impairment for changes in physical disablement processes over twenty years of study data. Finally, we will 3) assess differences in dementia-related physical disablement within the group by gender, socioeconomic status, and sociocultural factors. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of long-term health change for Mexican Americans in late life and an estimation of how many Mexican Americans with dementia need support in late life. Ultimately, our objective is to develop and evaluate a new empirical model to describe long-term patterns of dementia for physical disablement processes that can be replicated with other segments of the aging population to determine the extent of need for specialized long-term support services. Project Narrative Currently, little is known about the nature of dementia-specific physical disablement processes for the rapidly growing and rapidly aging Mexican American population. We propose to utilize data from a cohort study of Mexican Americans and develop an innovative research design to examine heterogeneity in physical disablement processes and the role of dementia as these disablement processes unfold. The proposed study will advance knowledge of dementia-related physical disablement in the aging Latino population in the U.S. and highlight segments of this population that would greatly benefit from effective policy and program initiatives.",Dementia and Physical Disablement Processes among Aging Latinos,9697739,R03AG059107,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dressing ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Family ', ' Gills ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maintenance ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Gender ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Baths ', ' Bathing ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Policies ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Physical shape ', ' morphological signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' community living ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' high risk ', ' cognitive disability ', ' public health intervention ', ' cognitive ability ', ' dementia care ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' care costs ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R03,2019,77491,0.06354623014218413
"Role of midlife cardiovascular disease on Alzheimer’s Pathology and cerebrovascular reactivity in the young-old. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely related to the presence of cardiovascular disease (CaVD), understanding the relationship between amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology and CaVD is critically important. The overarching goal of this study is to further the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology, including Aβ and tau pathology and neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular reactivity and midlife CaVD. To achieve these goals, we will utilize a group non-demented participants from an existing cohort from the ongoing community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with a cohort of 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years at study entry and has collected a wealth of longitudinal vascular measures. We hypothesize that subclinical CaVD identified in midlife is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease pathology expressed as amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration. These changes in brain structure would be associated with alterations in cognition both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We further hypothesize that the change in cognition will result from a failure of vascular compensatory responses, marked by increases in regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CaVD) are two of the most common disorders of aging, understanding the relationship between the pathologies of these two disorders is critically important.

"Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this application, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a presidentially initiated effort to understand the genetics of AD in hopes of developing new targets for therapies. Currently lacking in these efforts, however, is the inclusion of African American (AA) populations and the generalization of research findings to AA communities.

"Understanding how physician cognitive biases affect the treatment of older adults with dementia and other vulnerable populations Project Summary Dan P. Ly, MD, MPP, is an inpatient teaching attending physician in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System and a PhD candidate in health policy (economics track) at Harvard University whose long- term interest is in improving the quality of care for vulnerable populations. This postdoctoral fellowship will help Dr. Ly develop into an independent investigator with expertise in physician decision-making. Dr. Ly's extensive programming experience with large databases and the substantial formal training he has received have prepared him to perform the proposed research. This proposal, on how cognitive biases among physicians may be exacerbated when caring for older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and for minority patients, builds on Dr. Ly's prior work on health care disparities by testing for a mechanism for such disparities. The training plan will build upon prior training through three goals: 1) gain guided experience with the care of older adults from specialists in dementia and geriatrics; 2) develop expertise in helping doctors make better decisions; and 3) acquire skills in methodology (e.g., qualitative and experimental methods) complementary to Dr. Ly's training in large database analysis. Dr. Ly will be mentored by Dr. David Cutler, a nationally-renowned health economist who is an eager and experienced mentor. His co-mentor is Dr. Anupam Jena, a physician and health economist with physician behavior expertise. Dr. Ly has assembled an advisory committee with expertises in gerontology, decision-making, statistics, management, and informatics. Quality of care is known to be suboptimal, particularly for older adults. As the population ages, it is important to identify barriers to delivering high-quality care to older adults. One set of barriers may be physician cognitive biases that may occur more often when caring for such patients, especially patients with conditions like ADRD that may make communication difficult. Some cognitive biases may also worsen when caring for racial and ethnic minority patients. Little is known about consequences of cognitive biases on a national scale for these vulnerable populations because the factors physicians weigh are often not in the claims data commonly used. Dr. Ly will use rich, national electronic health record data from the VA and focus on a common scenario: assessing patients with shortness of breath for the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). His project has three aims. First, he will examine whether physicians pay attention to objective clinical factors validated to correlate with PE risk and whether they also focus on arguably extraneous factors, such as diagnoses of recent patients seen (Aim 1). Second, he will determine whether physician attention on these objective factors is significantly lower for patients with ADRD (Aim 2). Third, he will examine whether this attention is also significantly lower for minority patients (Aim 3). This research may help explain deficiencies in quality of care for vulnerable populations and inform the design of future interventions to counter cognitive biases and improve care. Project Narrative As the population ages, how physicians care for an aging population—one in which prevalent conditions like Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) may make communicating with physicians challenging— is important to understand. Such communication difficulties may exacerbate known physician cognitive biases, which may adversely affect the quality of care patients with ADRD receive; these cognitive biases may influence the quality of care for minority patients as well. The proposed research will use rich, national electronic health record data to examine how cognitive biases among physicians may lead them to pay less attention to important clinical data in the medical record, which may inform the development of decision support tools to counter these cognitive biases and improve the quality of care for vulnerable populations.",Understanding how physician cognitive biases affect the treatment of older adults with dementia and other vulnerable populations,9768138,F32AG060650,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Inpatients ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' statistics ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Event ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' interest ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' clinical risk ', ' support tools ', ' racial minority ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,74084,0.018486847208210328
"Whole Genome Sequencing in Ethnically Diverse Cohorts for the ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) PROJECT SUMMARY  The Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national sequencing initiative focused on identifying genetic risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in an effort to identify new pathways for prevention and new targets for drug development. The projects’ discovery phase included whole exome sequencing (WES) of 10,914 unrelated cases (N=5,778) and controls (N=5,136) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,019 familial samples. A majority of these samples are non-Hispanic white (NHW) in origin, making the addition of ethnically diverse samples to the study critical to identification of both shared and novel genetic risk factors for AD between populations. This ethnic diversity was emphasized in the ‘ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) Phase’ planning stage with a directive that additional existing cohorts with unrelated AD cases that ‘encompass the richest possible ethnic diversity’ be given the highest priority for inclusion.  To fulfill the goals of this RFA and this FUS Phase Mandate, this proposal identifies seven existing elderly cohorts of African-American (AA) and pan-HI ancestry with a total of 10,430 samples (N=2,322 AA AD cases and 1,843 AA controls and 2,928 Hispanic AD cases and 2,875 Hispanic controls) for WGS and processing in collaboration with existing NIH-funded AD infrastructure. Combining these cohorts with existing African America (AA) and Hispanic (HI) sequencing from the Washington Heights-Hamilton Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the ADSP will provide large ethnically diverse datasets for both validation of ADSP discovery phase findings and discovery of novel risk and/or protective variants for AD. Importantly, these data will allow for admixture mapping, a powerful method of gene mapping for diseases that show differential risk by ancestry, by comparing allele frequency differences between populations. They will also become an invaluable resource for the AD research community at-large, and will help to address the health disparities that contribute to AA and HI populations having higher rates of AD than NHW. Thus, we will address these important issues by creating a large dataset of AA and pan-HI AD cases and controls for study.  Specifically we propose to: 1) increase the ethnic diversity of the ADSP by assembling samples from existing cohorts with AA and HI AD cases and controls; 2) collaborate with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) in assemblage, storage, and distribution of DNA on these cohorts; 3) generating genome-wide SNP array data and WGS for all collected samples; and 4) collaborate with the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) in processing, quality controls, storage and distribution of the final datasets. Our overall goal is to enhance the discovery of AD risk factors by facilitating research on AD in ethnically diverse datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE To gather data and sequence 10,000 individuals from diverse cohorts in the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) creating an invaluable resource for the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research community at large. We will do this by 1) assembling samples from existing cohorts with African-American (AA) and Hispanic (HI) AD cases and controls in conjunction with Columbia University, 2) by collaborating with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) in assembling DNA on these individuals, 3) by generating genome-wide SNP array data at the University of Miami (UM) and whole genome sequencing data at New York Genome Center (NYGC), and 4) by collaborating with the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and the Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) in processing, storing and delivering final datasets.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Ethnically Diverse Cohorts for the ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS),9757653,U01AG057659,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Americas ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Mexican ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' drug development ', ' repository ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Validation ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' adjudicate ', ' Population ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' dbGaP ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' human genomics ', ' SNP array ', ' SNP chip ', ' admixture mapping ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' protective factors ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,5665149,0.12920033073107134

"The Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research The Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health of the Johns Hopkins University are proposing a new Alzheimer's-related Resources Center for Minority Aging Research (AD- RCMAR) in response to RFA-AG-18-002. The aims of this application are to: (1) mentor early- stage investigators from underrepresented backgrounds in minority aging and health disparities research, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD), using a life course perspective encompassing biological, behavioral, and community factors contributing to cognitive impairment and dementia in older minority adults; (2) conduct epidemiological, preventive, and intervention research that addresses ADRD in later life within a multi-level framework that encompasses individuals, families, social networks, and communities; and 3) engage communities and health care providers – especially family caregivers, primary care practices, communities of faith, and community organizations – as our partners in recognizing dementia and developing interventions with the potential to prevent cognitive decline and reduce ADRD dementia risk and disparities in minority older adults. The Johns Hopkins AD- RCMAR consists of: (1) an Administrative Core whose function is to provide governance and an administrative structure, to support research, to foster interactions between Cores and other Centers, and to ensure RCMAR Scientists develop mentoring relationships across the affiliated departments, schools, the intramural program at NIA in Baltimore, and nationally; (2) a Research Education Component to foster diverse junior investigators and mid-career investigators transitioning into ADRD-relevant research through support for individual pilot projects, career mentoring, scholar-to-scholar interactions, and role modeling; (3) a Community- Liaison and Recruitment Core to ensure the relevance of the ADRD research and to increase knowledge of engagement of community members in the research enterprise with the creation of a Community Resource Institute as a venue for community-investigator interaction; and (4) an Analysis Core as a foundation for methodological and statistical mentoring, including education and mentoring in mixed-methods research. An Executive Committee includes community representatives and a Scientific Advisory Panel consists of distinguished investigators with relevant expertise in minority aging, disparities, and ADRD. A pilot project program supported by all Cores to facilitate the development of RCMAR Scientists includes three initial pilot projects focusing on recruitment of minority populations for ADRD research, early diagnoses of dementia, and intervention development related to ADRD-related driving disparities. The burden of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) falls disproportionately on the minority older population. Research on minority aging to understand racial/ethnic disparities in ADRD and to develop interventions and preventive strategies to reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk is urgently needed. A goal of this application is to train and support early- stage investigators from underrepresented backgrounds who are carrying out ADRD-relevant research that supports cognitive health and well being in minority older adults.",The Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research,9770735,P30AG059298,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Social Network ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Detection ', ' Intramural Research Program ', ' Intramural Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Older Population ', ' investigator training ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' older driver ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community organizations ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' collaborative environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' recruit ', ' service delivery ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,P30,2019,1032968,0.06767835922567328
"National Social Life and Aging Project:  Wave 4 The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study which extends our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. The project is unique among nationally representative studies of older adults in the breadth and detail of health data collected, incorporating physical, psychological, sensory, functional, cognitive and social measures. In particular, we have unparalleled longitudinal measures of changes in the structure of social networks and relationships of respondents and their partners throughout the study as well as information on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). We propose to conduct in-home interviews in 2020–21 (Wave 4 [W4]) with all surviving respondents and their spouses/partners from the first three waves (W1-W3), providing 15 years of follow-up and four waves of data on this important cohort (aged 72-100 at W4). For innovations introduced in W2— a multi-domain measure of cognition (the MoCA-SA), detailed olfactory assessment, complete data from spouses/partners, an accelerometry study of sleep and daily activity, and more comprehensive measures in all domains—W4 will provide a third data point needed to model changes in health, associations, and causal relationships between them. We will enhance the data with new measures of cognition, including item response times, proxy reports, and diagnosis of ADRDs; linking to administrative data files, such as Medicare; and objectively measuring, concurrently, all five classic senses. As one example, W4 will allow the testing of key hypotheses regarding cognitive changes from normal function through dementia, providing important insights into Alzheimer's disease.  With these data, we aim to extend our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. Additionally, we will develop a framework for enrolling the oldest NSHAP subjects into internal and external investigator initiated studies addressing novel social, behavioral, and clinical questions (such as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and related dementias) in representative samples of this historically understudied population. With its rich and novel measures of social networks and of the biological, physical and psychological components of health—all measured longitudinally from both partners in a couple—NSHAP is uniquely poised to bridge the gap between large, epidemiological studies of social relationships and health and experimental studies of the mechanisms involved. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study which extends our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. In 2020-21, NSHAP W4 will collect information on the health and wellbeing of Americans ages 72 to 100 and their partners.

"Culture-Gene Relationship:  A Novel Model of Aging Cognitive Health Abstract  To reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), scientists and policy makers have called for new models of the disease. The proposed project tests a novel model of how culture and genes may interact to influence AD and cognitive health. This project will provide the first investigation of whether a modifiable, culture-based environmental factor, negative age beliefs, exacerbates the effect of the genetic-risk-factor apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4) on adverse cognitive outcomes, including risk for AD, and whether positive age beliefs increase the likelihood that APOE ε2 leads to beneficial cognitive outcomes, including reduced AD risk. The proposed project builds on our findings with older individuals that (a) negative age beliefs can lead to greater stress, worse cognitive outcomes, and a greater accumulation of AD biomarkers; and (b) positive age beliefs can protect against these outcomes. This project also builds on the finding that APOE ε4 and ε2 account for less than half of aging-cognition variance; age beliefs may help to explain the remaining variance. Our proposed project with older persons will examine four specific aims for the first time: Aim 1. To examine whether the APOE genotype moderates age beliefs' impact on cognitive outcomes. We predict: (a) APOE ε4 carriers will show a greater detrimental impact of negative age beliefs on cognitive outcomes, compared to non-APOE ε4 carriers; and (b) APOE ε2 carriers will show a greater beneficial impact of positive age beliefs on cognitive outcomes, compared to non-APOE ε2 carriers. Aim 2. To examine whether our age belief-APOE genotype model helps to explain disparities by race and sex on cognitive outcomes. Considering that members of marginalized groups may be more sensitive to age stereotypes, we predict: (a) African Americans will show a stronger additive influence of APOE ε4 and negative age beliefs on detrimental cognitive outcomes, as well as a stronger additive influence of APOE ε2 and positive age beliefs on beneficial cognitive outcome, compared to Whites; and (b) women, compared to men, will show the same pattern as older African Americans described in Aim 2a. Aim 3. To examine whether psychosocial factors, related to age beliefs, influence Aim 1 patterns. We predict: (a) those higher in vulnerability factors (e.g., perceived discrimination) will show a stronger additive influence of APOE ε4 and negative age beliefs on detrimental cognitive outcomes, as well as a weaker additive influence of APOE ε2 and positive age beliefs on beneficial cognitive outcomes; and (b) those higher in resiliency factors (e.g., feeling useful to others) will show the reverse pattern. Aim 4. To examine whether psychological and behavioral mechanisms link the age belief-genotype predictor to cognitive outcomes. We predict: stress and physical activity will act as mediators of this association.  This proposed project will draw on three longitudinal datasets with common key variables. This study meets the NIA priority to identify factors that could help explain disparities in AD risk by race and sex. Narrative  The proposed project presents and tests a new model of how culture and genes may interact to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive health.

"Role of PUFA-Gene Interactions in Health Disparities Overwhelming scientific evidence indicates that nutritional landscapes of contemporary populations interact with genetic variation among human populations resulting in evolutionary discordance and enhanced inflammatory responses associated with numerous diseases. As demanding as gene-diet interactions are for overall populations in developed countries, they manifest themselves in particularly negative ways in certain racial/ethnic groups. This is seen in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the US where data indicate that African Americans (AfAm) are about twice as likely to have AD and other dementias as European Americans (EuAm). The Central Hypothesis of the parent grant for this Supplement (Role of PUFA-Gene Interactions in Health Disparities [R01 AT008621]) is that a particular gene-diet interaction resulting from rapid changes in levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the modern Western diet leads to enhancement of biochemical networks that drive inflammation and exacerbate health disparities. The emergence of sophisticated technologies such as metabolomics/lipidomics along with the capacity to analyze large amounts of data and establish biochemical networks is dramatically enhancing the ability to determine mechanisms driving human diseases and identify molecular signatures that can determine disease status. The current supplement expands our hypotheses and leverages the experimental strategies and technological/data analysis advances (particularly lipidomics) made in the parent grant to address the question of whether there are different pathogenetic mechanisms that drive the disparities seen in the incidence of AD between AfAm versus EuAm patients. The transition to AD research by Dr. Chilton is catalyzed by a growing collaboration with Dr. Roberta Brinton, a leading international authority on AD and Director of the Center for Innovation in Brain Science at the University of Arizona. This Supplement tests three key hypotheses: 1) There are race-dependent biological mechanisms that contribute to the expression of AD; (2) Metabolic utilization of n-6 PUFAs in Western diets differs in AfAm and EuAm as a result of differences in allele frequencies of variants in desaturase enzymes (FADS 1 and 2). This results in increased ARA- relative to DHA-containing lyso-phospholipids and free fatty acids in the circulation of AfAm patients that can be transported across the BBB into the brain. (3) Combinations of lipid metabolic intermediates in circulation and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have the potential to serve as key biomarkers for AD status. These hypotheses will be tested utilizing lipidomic analyses of plasma and CSF from AfAm and EuAm cases and controls. Project Narrative: This project will test the hypothesis that a dramatic increase in a certain type of dietary fat (an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) over the past 50 years, together with altered metabolism based on genetics and ancestral background of human populations, contribute to Alzheimer’s disease and plays a key role in health disparities observed between African and European Ancestry populations. Thus, genetics may interact with dietary fat to impact the balance of fat metabolites that in turn drive brain inflammation and Alzheimer’s diseases more negatively in certain racial/ethnic populations more than others.",Role of PUFA-Gene Interactions in Health Disparities,9881902,R01AT008621,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Arizona ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Brain Inflammation ', ' Encephalitis ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fatty Acid Desaturating Enzymes ', ' Fatty Acid Desaturases ', ' Free Fatty Acids ', ' Nonesterified Fatty Acids ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Lysophospholipids ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Modernization ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphatides ', ' Phospholipids ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Shoulder ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' ω-6 ', ' Omega-6 PUFAs ', ' Omega-6 ', ' N-6 Fatty Acids ', ' Omega-6 Fatty Acids ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' disability ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Genetic Enhancement ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' American ', ' gene interaction ', ' authority ', ' desaturase ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Molecular ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' human disease ', ' parent grant ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' western diet ', ' racial minority ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,383750,0.14126135720213984
"Life Course Determinants of Epigenetic Age Acceleration and Subsequent Dementia PROJECT ABSTRACT  This proposal seeks to understand the impact of interactions between socioeconomic status (SES), genotype, and health behaviors on disparities in epigenetic age acceleration and cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. Under the guidance of primary mentor Dr. Sharon Kardia, the training and research plan will build upon Dr. Schmitz's expertise in health economics and genetic epidemiology to prepare her for an independent career that integrates social science, genetics, and epigenetics into aging research. The PI will pursue a program of training in epigenetics at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health that will advance her knowledge and skills in (1) epigenomic biology, (2) bioinformatics and related general programming, and (3) preprocessing and analysis of DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray data.  The proposed research plan will capitalize on a large sample of epigenome-wide data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (N=4,000) to construct measures of DNAm age in whole blood and test for associations with known genetic, social, and behavioral mechanisms of aging and cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. DNAm age been shown to predict age with high accuracy, and studies have linked positive deviations between DNAm age and chronological age (i.e. epigenetic age acceleration (age)) with age-related diseases and mortality, suggesting that epigenetic processes may play a role in healthy aging. However, few studies have investigated pathways between age and SES, and to date no study has evaluated whether the relationship between age and SES is moderated by genetic influences or mediated by risky health behaviors. This work builds on Dr. Schmitz's prior HRS research that used whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) and objective measures of the social environment to examine the effect of gene-environment interactions on physical health and cognitive function at older ages.  During the K99 phase, Dr. Schmitz will construct measures of DNAm age in the HRS to test for associations between age and disadvantaged SES, risky health behaviors, and demographic characteristics using longitudinal moderation-mediation methods. During the R00 phase, Dr. Schmitz will incorporate PGSs into the analyses to assess whether genetic propensity for educational attainment or cognition moderates the relationship between SES, age, and subsequent declines in cognitive function and incidence of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Comparative analyses will be conducted in an African American oversample (Nൎ1,000). R00 research will employ instrumental variables (IV) and dynamic panel methods to draw stronger claims regarding causality. Following these analyses, replication of main findings will be pursued in multi-ethnic cohorts that have comparable genetic, epigenetic, and social data. Results from this research program may shed light on the specific social and biological mechanisms that underpin the SES-mortality gradient. PROJECT NARRATIVE Research that can evaluate the joint effect of social and biological forces on age-related disease is needed to more accurately inform future research and policy intervention that seeks to extend life expectancy and quality of life among older adults. This study capitalizes on a large pilot sample of epigenome-wide data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (N=4,000) to understand the impact of socioeconomic status (SES), genotype, and risky health behaviors on disparities in epigenetic age acceleration and subsequent cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease.

"Racial and Geographic Disparities in Risk and Survival of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Abstract There exists a limited number of studies that assess health disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and even fewer for non-AD dementias. Insight from existing literature and our preliminary studies suggest that the most essential health disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) are related to race/ethnicity effects in AD risk and strong geographic gradient in mortality from AD. Our preliminary studies showed significant gaps between incidence rates for different race groups and mortality rates between East and West coast populations. In addition less significant disparities related to effects in rural/urban subpopulations and differences in survival from AD/ADRD were also identified. Detailed epidemiologic descriptions of these disparities, especially incorporating subgroups of AD-related dementias (ADRD), are lacking and the role of behavioral factors, comorbidity, time-dependent cognitive trajectories, and genetic effects in the developments of AD/ADRD are not sufficiently evaluated. Thus, there is a critical need to quantitatively describe the persistent disparities in the AD/ADRD outcomes and clarify the role of the multiple contributing factors. Our preliminary studies proved the ability to extract high-quality measures of the factors to be studied from the three datasets to be used in this study: 5%-Medicare, HRS-Medicare, and SEER-Medicare as well as Multiple Cause of Death database. Research in the project will be focused on i) re-evaluation of the disparities by calculating them with better accuracy and addressing limitations of our preliminary analyses, ii) multiple analyses designed to explain these disparities by analyzing the effects of potential mediators, iii) incorporating recent advanced methodological approaches such as a new partitioning approach for the decomposition of an overall trend into its causal components for analyses of these disparities in high volume data, and iv) incorporating new concepts for the explanation of these disparities, such as the contribution of over/underdiagnoses, heterogeneity in disease severity at time of diagnosis, analyses of patterns of conditions related to AD and ADRD, and the contribution of AD resilience to these disparities. Four Specific Aims planned in this study will deal with i) epidemiology of AD/ADRD, ii) behavior factors and comorbidity, iii) cognitive status and the effects of diagnosis severity and over/under diagnosis, and iv) genetic effects and cognitive resilience. The completion of these Aims will results not only in robust estimates of the disparities in AD/ADRD outcomes in diverse populations, but also, ultimately results in improvements in public health that can be achieved through reducing the identified disparities in AD/ADRD using targeted information based on the in-depth analyses conducted in this project. The expected outcome will be detailed disease-specific information presented in a quantitative form that provides the contribution of each studied factor to race/income-related health disparities in U.S. older adults. We will uncover the barriers in health-care provision that can be further used for improving primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention in the U.S. resulting, in their turn, in improved survival and higher life span. Narrative The processes causing the disparities in health outcomes in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are not well investigated. The objective of this study is to provide a series of estimates characterizing the effects of specific variables that explain the relationship between population groups and differences in health outcomes. The results of the study will uncover barriers in health-care provision the removal of which will aid in the development of public health interventions and improvements in preventive care for these serious health conditions ultimately leading to improved longevity in the U.S.",Racial and Geographic Disparities in Risk and Survival of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,9891704,R01AG066133,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Genetic ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' tertiary prevention ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' nursing home length of stay ', ' nursing home stay ', ' nursing home days ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' public health intervention ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' cognitive interview ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,767378,0.1782007314971342
"Dementia epidemiology, health service utilization and treatment costs among American Indian and Alaska Native Elders PROJECT SUMMARY  As the US population ages, the number of people living with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is projected to triple by 2050. Although the life expectancy of American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) is much shorter than that of other US populations, it has dramatically increased in the last few decades, with the expansion of the AI/AN elder population expected to continue. Compared to most US populations, AI/ANs bear a disproportionate burden of many established modifiable risk factors for dementia, such as diabetes, obesity, and smoking. However, our knowledge about dementia in this population remains to be severely limited. So far, only a handful of studies have examined dementia among AI/ANs, with reliable data on the prevalence or incidence of dementia in this population being nonexistent. Given so many gaps in our knowledge about dementia among AI/ANs, a systematic investigation is urgently needed to identify how problematic dementia is in this population and its impact on the Indian health system to enable more precise planning and prioritization of resources needed to support relevant health care policy. Here, leveraging on 16 years of longitudinal data available in the Indian Health Service (IHS) Data Project, a synthesis of existing IHS electronic health data for nearly 30% of the IHS service population (~ 640,000 AI/ANs), we propose to address 4 major knowledge gaps about dementia among AI/ANs as guided by the following specific aims: (1) Estimate dementia prevalence, incidence, and comorbidity rates among AI/AN elders by individual and community characteristics, such as age, gender, location, and county level socioeconomic status; (2) Characterize the association between dementia and potentially modifiable risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, binge drinking, traumatic brain injuries and depression; (3) Evaluate the influence of dementia and comorbidity status on health service utilization patterns, including inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy services; and (4) Examine the costs of providing treatment among AI/ANs with dementia, and factors that influence these costs such as comorbidity status. Our proposed analyses will provide a relatively accurate and complete picture for the epidemiology of diagnosed dementia among AI/ANs based on a large and geographically diverse sample, and contribute to the understanding of dementia and associated health service utilization in an extremely underserved population living in disadvantaged communities. Our findings promise to lay groundwork for future studies on dementia to address both the needs of AI/ANs and those of other similarly underserved populations.

"A Multidomain Approach to Preventing Dementia in African Americans: Cognitive Prescriptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT African Americans (AAs) are twice as likely to develop dementia than Whites, and evidence suggests that modifiable lifestyle factors account for much of this disparity. AAs also demonstrate poorer dementia knowledge than Whites. Yet, virtually no multi-domain dementia prevention interventions have targeted AAs. Lifespan approaches implementing behavioral therapies before manifestation of impairment may be particularly advantageous, as dementia pathology may precede symptoms by over 20 years. The current study will be the first to explore the feasibility and efficacy of an individualized approach dubbed Cognitive Prescriptions (CogRx) in middle-aged AAs. This approach targets five lifestyle areas: Physical Activity, Cognitive Activity, Diet, Sleep, and Social Activity. Deficiencies in these domains have been demonstrated observationally as behavioral risk factors for dementia. These malleable domains may be especially viable intervention targets, and may have positive secondary outcomes. At 3 and 6 months we will examine primary (i.e., lifestyle changes and dementia knowledge) and secondary (i.e., cognitive function and psychological function) outcomes across three groups: no-contact control, psychoeducation only, and psychoeducation + CogRx. The psychoeducation will target general dementia knowledge, including prevalence, prognosis, and general risk factor information, while the CogRx group will receive a tailored risk/protective factor profile across the five aforementioned domains while also addressing barriers to these areas. The CogRx condition will develop a tailored plan prioritizing deficient domains and integrate activities in their daily lives over the following 3-months. The CogRx condition will receive daily text-messaging reminders and adherence queries over the 3-months and will provide qualitative feedback for future implementation of this program at the 3- month follow-up. The current study will overcome limitations of prior multi-domain cognitive interventions by: 1) enrolling middle-aged adults with a focus on prevention, 2) examining a broad range of lifestyle domains, 3) using self-initiated “prescriptions” for behavioral changes rather than structured lab-based interventions or supplements/medications, 4) assessing adherence and self-efficacy, 5) tailoring the intervention to deficient areas, 6) examining psychological/mental health outcomes, 7) examining dementia knowledge. The theoretical underpinnings for this approach include the Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model, in that providing tailored risk factor information (i.e., susceptibility), concrete goals, and outcome expectations while also addressing self-efficacy and barriers will promote behavior change. The ultimate goal of this research is to: 1) yield new perspectives for implementation of person-centered behavioral modification interventions targeting cognitive outcomes in diverse populations, 2) impact clinical and public health recommendations for maintaining cognitive health in aging populations, and 3) reduce racial disparities in dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the increased risk for dementia in African Americans, the significant evidence on the role health behaviors may play in this risk, and evidence of less dementia knowledge in this group, virtually no studies have targeted this population in behavioral modification cognitive interventions. The current study will test the feasibility and initial efficacy of individualized cognitive prescriptions (CogRx) in middle-aged African Americans that combines dementia knowledge psychoeducation with a tailored risk and protective factor profile based on five lifestyle domains. The ultimate goal of this research is to: 1) yield new perspectives for implementation of person-centered behavioral modification interventions targeting cognitive outcomes in diverse populations, 2) impact clinical and public health recommendations for maintaining cognitive health in aging populations, and 3) reduce racial disparities in dementia prevalence.",A Multidomain Approach to Preventing

"Multi-modal Imaging in a Diverse Cohort: The Wake Forest ADCC Neuroimaging Core This application proposes the addition of a Neuroimaging Core (NIC) to the newly established Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine. The NIC will address a critical need to establish biomarkers that reliably differentiate Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from other conditions that affect cognition in aging. Recently, an AD research framework was developed for a biologically-based classification to enhance identification of disease mechanisms, to appropriately target therapeutic interventions, and to track therapeutic response and disease progression. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure structural changes and positron emission tomography (PET) to track changes in pathological hallmarks such as b-amyloid and tau, comprise a powerful approach to characterize the progressive pathology associated with cognitive decline and to differentiate AD from other dementias. To establish reliable biomarkers associated with AD and other conditions that impair cognition with aging will require a large collaborative effort and the national NIH ADC network is ideally suited to address this need. The Wake Forest ADCC can make unique contributions to the network; the NIC will conduct longitudinal, multimodal neuroimaging paired with phenotypic and genomic characterization of a diverse cohort of participants. The NIC will provide expertise and resources to complement the ADCC themes, which focus on: 1) early transitions from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD; 2) the role of metabolic and vascular risk in these transitions; and 3) ethnic differences modulating these relationships. The first aim of the NIC will be to leverage existing Clinical Core and imaging infrastructure, including research-dedicated PET and MRI, cyclotron, and advanced analytic pipelines to help identify the causes of AD and develop novel strategies for prevention and treatment. As a second aim, the NIC will optimize participation of underrepresented groups in neuroimaging protocols, with a special focus on African-Americans, to better understand and reduce disparities in their risk of AD and other dementias. The third aim will be to expand interactions with the ADC network and NACC, and with institutional partners through aligned neuroimaging methods and new collaborations. The final aim will be to provide training and consultation on the latest scientific advances in neuroimaging to ADCC-affiliated investigators. Through these aims, the Wake Forest ADCC NIC will further the understanding of AD pathology and its relationship to cognitive decline and will significantly enhance the Center’s contribution to the ADC network and to investigators worldwide. This application proposes the addition of a new Neuroimaging Core to the Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (ADCC). Establishment of this Neuroimaging Core will enable long-term, repeated observation of the pathological changes associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease using multiple neuroimaging techniques in well-characterized study participants. The Neuroimaging Core will help Wake Forest ADCC researchers differentiate AD from other dementias and address important scientific questions, such as the contributions of vascular and metabolic risk factors in multiple ethnic groups, and will greatly expand the resources that are provided by the ADCC to the broader Alzheimer’s disease research field. !",Multi-modal Imaging in a Diverse Cohort:

"A Culturally-Relevant Approach to Reducing Dementia Caregiver Stress in an Underserved Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans currently are the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S., thus, the number of Asian Americans with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers will also increase. Surprisingly, very little intervention work has focused on addressing caregiver needs in this population. Specifically, a large gap exists in the development of interventions to reduce caregiver stress and little is known about how cultural diversity impacts caregiver stress and intervention outcomes. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will give Dr. Meyer the skills, training, and mentoring necessary to conduct community-engaged interventions to reduce the burden of AD in culturally diverse family caregivers. The proposed mentored research activities for this K01 award are to refine and pilot test a theoretically-informed, culturally-relevant, community-based intervention informed by sociocultural stress and coping and social contextual models to reduce distress and enhance well-being in Vietnamese American dementia caregivers. By focusing on this large and underserved population, this K01 application is consistent with NIA Research Goal E: Improve our ability to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults. It als responds to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) to involve more racially/ethnically diverse older adults in research and to develop effective services to support ethnically diverse families. This application includes experiential and research activities in three critical areas fo Dr. Meyer's career development: (1) knowledge of AD and associated dementias (e.g., risk factors, assessment and diagnosis, course) and cognitive impairment and how they affect families, (2) methodological skills and cultural knowledge to conduct community-engaged intervention research, including formal training in aspects of community-based participatory research (e.g. mixed methods) and enhanced knowledge of Vietnamese culture and language, and (3) theoretical and methodological skills necessary to design, implement, and analyze scientifically rigorous interventions for culturally diverse populations (e.g., design issues, longitudinal data analysis). Mentored research training will occur in the context of a focused research project with two aims: (1) Refine and manualize a culturally- informed intervention to reduce distress and enhance well-being in Vietnamese dementia caregivers, and (2) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Completion of the proposed research and career development activities will generate data to inform the development of an R34 or R21 application and provide Dr. Meyer with the experience necessary to transition from observational/ descriptive to community-based intervention work. Dr. Meyer will leverage existing resources and expertise at three NIH-funded centers at UC Davis: the Alzheimer's disease Center, the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research, and the Clinical and Translational Science Center. These resources, along with the mentoring team's strong, collaborative relationships with local community-based organizations will provide an enriched environment that will help Dr. Meyer to be a successful and independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the number of Asian Americans rapidly grows, so too will the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers. Caregivers of persons with AD suffer a substantial burden emotionally, physically, and financially, and this may be especially true for immigrant and underserved Asians. The development of psychosocial interventions that address the diversity and complexity of caregiver distress in culturally diverse populations is a critical public health challenge.",A

"Alzheimer's care management in minority groups: Identifying warning signs and crisis points in transitions from informal to formal care management in African American and Latino populations Project Abstract Alzheimer's is a growing concern in Hispanic and African American populations, with increased incidence and earlier age of onset as compared to the non-Hispanic White population. Informal caregivers provide the majority of care for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD),with Hispanic and African American caregivers accessing formal care systems less frequently and at later stages compared to non-Hispanic White families. Community organizations serving persons with Alzheimer's in Milwaukee county long recognize the lag in informal care systems transitioning primary care management to formal paid care, waiting until a crisis in inability to provide care, and/or inability to maintain the health and safety for the patient within the informal care system occurs. However, it is unclear what early warning signs preceded the crisis and what formal care providers, including physicians, social work, nursing, family workers and dementia care specialists, know about warning signs and crisis in these families. Data and discussions from a multi-stakeholder community coalition suggest that formal and informal systems of care may diverge in their interpretation of early warning signs, crisis points and cultural considerations around care transitions. Thus assessing what both the caregiver and healthcare professional know about early warning signs and how both groups interpret this information will inform the development of culturally adapted, pre-crisis interventions. This study aims to identify both family and formal care providers' views of care transitions, warning signs and care crisis points, and where their views of these situations both converge and diverge. The proposed study will collect family and service provider level data from up to 240 African American and Hispanic family caregivers (including adult and youth key informants), and 50 service providers recruited through a community coalition, including the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Medical College of Wisconsin, The United Community Center, Alzheimer's Association and Milwaukee County Department on Aging. This study will be the first to identify culturally relevant warning signs to guide the development of culturally adapted informal and formal educational interventions with African American and Hispanic communities, designed to avert care crises. It will also nuance the caregiving paradigm through the inclusion of youth caregivers, providing the first insight into the youth view of caregiving transitions and what they see as warning signs and crisis points, adding dimension to informal caregiving knowledge and programming. The proposed study engages several community-based service providers, focusing on the need to understanding cultural issues in caregiving through the lens of organizations that are accessed and trusted by the target population. Results will contribute to the NIA mission to improve the well-being of AD patients and caregivers by developing a better understanding of caregiving needs and the disparities inherent in the transition from informal to formal care management. Narrative statement This study is relevant to both the mission of the NIA and public health by providing information on previously unknown warning signs and care crisis points leading to a transition of primary care between informal and formal care management in African American and Hispanic families with Alzheimer's or related dementias (ADRD). Utilizing a community based approach, this study uniquely engages adult and youth caregivers, and community based service providers to assess early warning signs and disparities identified by informal caregivers and formal care providers. Results are expected to inform care coordination and education interventions for underserved African American and Hispanic patients with ADRD, caregivers and formal acre providers.",Alzheimer's care management in minority groups: Identifying warning signs and crisis points in transitions from informal to formal care management in African American and Latino populations,9849713,R21AG061307,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Crisis Intervention ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Age of Onset ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' cooking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' forgetting ', ' Familiarity ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Emotional ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' elder care ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' community based service ', ' community organizations ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' efficacy testing ', ' community center ', ' informal care ', ' Informal care giver ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giving ', ' informal caregiving ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' Formal care giver ', ' Formal caregiver ', ' dementia care ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' service providers ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", "" Alzheimer's care "", "" Alzheimer's disease care "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2020,179446,0.0684988176461543
"Longitudinal Biological Pathways Leading to Alzheimer's Disease Health Disparities in Blacks PROJECT SUMMARY Blacks are more than twice as likely to develop dementia than Whites. However, controlling for many of the factors that put Blacks at greater risk, such as having less education and lower occupational status, does not eliminate these health disparities. Therefore, other race-related factors underlie the increased risk for dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). One possibility is that multiple levels of chronic stress found uniquely in Blacks, exacerbate these health disparities. As outlined by the NIA's Health Disparities Research Framework, these stressors stem from environmental factors such as residential segregation, sociocultural factors such as racism, and behavioral factors such as one's perceived control. It is clear that these types of stressors negatively impact mental health, but a large gap exists between a) these generalized stressors, b) neurobiological pathways, and c) a diagnosis of AD in Blacks. Because AD is a brain disease, this knowledge gap can be illuminated by understanding the biological progression from “normal” to AD in Blacks. According to the neurotoxicity hypothesis, prolonged exposure to stress increases the brain's vulnerability to pathological toxins and reduces the brain's ability to resist subtle brain damage. Thus, unique race-related stressors might lead to a brain environment that is more vulnerable to AD pathology (beta-amyloid and tau) and accelerates declines in brain structure and the associated cognitive declines that lead to AD in Blacks compared with Whites. By harmonizing data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and the Minority Aging Research Study, secondary analyses will be conducted to analyze the biological pathways that create and sustain race-related health disparities in AD. We will use multi-level model regression techniques to test the extent that 1) rates of longitudinal declines in cortical thickness will be associated with greater cognitive decline in Blacks than Whites and 2) rates of longitudinal declines in hippocampal volumes and a novel measure of hippocampal complexity will be associated with greater cognitive decline in Blacks than Whites. Addressing whether Blacks are more vulnerable to longitudinal cognitive decline through different neurodegenerative pathways than Whites would lead to a theoretical framework that would provide testable hypotheses of causes of these potential vulnerabilities (like racial stressors). PROJECT NARRATIVE We will examine the biological pathways that lead to a two- to four-fold increase in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in Blacks compared with Whites. This health disparity is a critical public health concern because the impact on healthcare resources and personal income currently is and will continue to be an enormous burden on society (an estimated $214 billion), especially in Blacks, who are the least likely to seek out early medical help, receive adequate treatment, and can afford such treatments. We anticipate that the study would allow us to define brain vulnerabilities within Blacks that could lead to future interventions that target those brain pathways with real promise to delay the onset

"Additional Sequencing for the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic contribution to AD remains unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is using large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. In the most recent wave of funding, the ADSP is sequencing individuals from the ADSP Follow-up Study (FUS) through AG057659 and AG062943. These efforts were specifically designed to improve racial and ethnic diversity in the ADSP datasets as well as to acquire unique and powerful data sets for gene discovery in NHW individuals, such as the Amish protective variant (AMISHPV) dataset, several large autopsy-confirmed series and the ADGC's early-onset AD dataset. The purpose of these studies has been to capitalize on differences in genetic backgrounds that may facilitate the identification of new protective and risk loci and ultimately address health disparities for AD and related disorders in underserved populations. Including the cohorts in this application, the ADSP-FUS will perform WGS on nearly 30,000 individuals. An added benefit of this application is the processing and delivery of high quality WGS and phenotype data on the new cohorts in this application. Specifically we propose to: (1) Increase the diversity and further enrich the clinical phenotype data of the ADSP through inclusion of ~1900 AD cases and controls from the Alzheimer Disease Center (ADC) Hispanic cohort, ~1500 AD cases and controls from the Faroe Islands, and ~3,200 AD cases and controls from the well characterized ethnically diverse A4 Clinical Trial Cohort; (2) work closely with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD) in assembling DNA and blood on these existing cohorts which will ultimately serve as a central resource for the Alzheimer's disease research community; (3) generate genome-wide SNP array data and WGS data for all collected samples using established resources; (4) collaborate with NIAGADS, GCAD and the HIHG CGESG-PGNC QC Teams in processing, storage, and delivery of final datasets to NIAGADS for public data release; and (5) harmonize clinical data from newly acquired and existing FUS datasets to generate high quality inferentially equivalent phenotypes and endophenotypes. This project will merge several new cohorts into the ADSP-FUS to further enhance the ADSP as an invaluable resource for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research community. These efforts will speed discoveries of targets for AD diagnosis, prevention, and treatment for all populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will provide data and sequence on an additional 6,600+ individuals to increase the diversity of the and sample sets in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), creating an invaluable resource for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research community at large.

"Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) aims to foster and enhance innovative research in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) with the long term goals to 1) advance ADRD-relevant social and behavioral science research in underserved and underrepresented communities while; 2) diversify the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging. This center will build on the existing deep infrastructure and research strengths in dementia and aging research at the University of Michigan (UM). The MCCFAD will emphasize research in three priority areas of: epidemiology, health economics, and culturally sensitive care. The rationale for these three areas is directly related to the current lack of a comprehensive understanding of the contextual complexities inherent in ADRD disparities, the need to enhance diversity in the professional research workforce addressing the brain and cognitive health of older adults, as well as dynamic changes in the demographic and multi-cultural composition of the U.S. population. The MCCFAD will promote diversifying the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging through collaborations with other NIA-sponsored Centers and programs and via connections with R1, R2 and R3 universities in Michigan. The Center will focus on the contexts in which ADRD is experienced. Knowledge concerning the contexts of ADRD is quite limited but has been shown to be critical for elucidating sociocultural, economic and behavioral contributors to and consequences of health disparities generally and ADRD disparities specifically. The Center's four Cores are: Administrative (AC), Research and Education (REC), Analytic (AnC), Community Liaison and Recruitment (CLRC) with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Advance ADRD-relevant disparities research in epidemiology, health economics, and culturally-sensitive care; Aim 2: Recruit and mentor 15 AD-RCMAR Scientists (RS) from the pilot-study investigator stage through professional publications and independent research applications and funding; Aim 3: Connect with African American, Arab American and Latino communities to broaden understanding of intra- and inter-cultural factors affecting participation in ADRD research. The Center profits from the groundbreaking, successful work of their extensive network of experienced mentors and experts. These resources, along with planned structure and activities will ensure that, upon receiving NIA designation as an AD-RCMAR, the MCCFAD will have a significant impact in diversifying the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging while enhancing research to better understand AD and related forms of dementia across various contexts. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer's Disease (MCCFAD) will focus on the social and behavioral dynamics in which Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are experienced. To address ADRD, one of the fastest growing health problems in the United States, the MCCFAD builds on longstanding strengths at the University of Michigan in 1) dementia research; 2) mentoring scientists from underrepresented backgrounds; 3) partnerships with Michigan NIA Centers; and 4) links to Michigan's two other major research universities, Michigan State University and Wayne State University. The MCCFAD will lead a coordinated effort to advance health disparity research in three priority areas: epidemiology, health economics, and culturally sensitive care, focusing on African Americans, Arab Americans and Latinos.

"Development of Culturally-Sensitive and Patient-Centered Feedback for Alzheimer's Dementia Risk Disclosure Project Summary: Development of Culturally-Sensitive and Patient-Centered Feedback for Alzheimer's Dementia Risk Disclosure With improvement in neuroimaging and biomarker measurement, earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been made possible. Similarly, these methods have informed risk for Dementia – Alzheimer's Type (DAT), the advanced phenotypic presentation of AD. Accordingly, patient interest in understanding their personal risk for DAT has grown exponentially, with up to 90% of the population requesting DAT feedback. While studies have produced general suggestions for providing feedback about individual risk factors, no study has systematically compared patient and family member preferences for the amount and type of risk disclosure information received (standard clinical information, genotype, neuroimaging, biomarkers). Without understanding the expectations of diverse patient populations for DAT risk disclosure, we cannot effectively communicate the information gained through recent scientific advances, creating a translational problem. Furthermore, a critical oversight of existing DAT risk disclosure literature is an inattention to the patient-specific factors that dictate preferences for and ability to adapt to DAT risk feedback. In particular, psychological and sociocultural differences experienced by African-American patients and families are critical factors dictating feedback preferences and utility, but have not previously been evaluated in risk disclosure literature. The lack of culturally-informed feedback protocols represents an ethical and practical challenge facing all AD researchers, and an opportunity to directly address a potential source of healthcare disparities in a vulnerable population. The proposed project will respond to these identified empirical gaps by developing semi-structured feedback protocols for DAT risk disclosure that are informed by patient-specific characteristics, preferences and rationale. In Year 1, we will utilize the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Core Center's longitudinal cohort to conduct a systematic assessment of the needs and desires of a racially diverse sample of cognitively intact or MCI-diagnosed patients and their caregivers (Specific Aim 1). Specifically, we will investigate the desired level of risk information (none, based on readily clinically available information, genetic information, quantitative neuroimaging, and/or amyloid and tau biomarker burden), as well as personal motivations for requesting this information, in a sample of African-American and White older adults. The needs assessment will also analyze patient-specific factors that influence risk disclosure preferences in these samples, through the lens of the Health Belief Model. In Year 2 we will develop and pilot patient-centered feedback protocols informed by the results of Year 1, with immediate and follow-up measurement of patient and informant satisfaction, comprehension, and psychological reactions (Specific Aim 2). These protocols will represent a foundational first step towards culturally-sensitive, flexible DAT risk disclosure, appropriate across demographic groups. Project Narrative The proposed project will develop semi-standardized risk disclosure protocols for Dementia – Alzheimer's type (DAT), informed by a needs assessment of racially diverse patients and informants with early AD changes. By understanding and integrating knowledge of recipient characteristics, preferences, and rationales, we will create patient-centered feedback protocols to effectively communicate complex clinical, genetic, neuroimaging, and biomarker-conferred risk for DAT. The project therefore addresses a critical ethical and practical challenge facing all AD researchers by directly investigating and responding to a source of health disparity in vulnerable minority

"Rhythm Experience and Africana Culture Trial (REACT) Abstract  African Americans are almost two times more likely than whites (i.e., Caucasians) to experience Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. For those over the age of 65, the prevalence of cognitive impairment is 8.8% in whites and 23.9% in African Americans. Even in the age range of 55-64, African Americans are 4 times more likely to experience cognitive impairment than their age-matched white counterparts. Increased risk of dementia among African Americans may be attributed to lower levels and quality of education, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and higher prevalence of vascular diseases, Type II diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, all of which are recognized as risk factors for dementia. A critical public health question emerges from these statistics that we intend to address in this proposal: Is there an effective method for reducing or eliminating the race disparities in cognitive and brain health? Fortunately, physical activity (PA) interventions may be effective at improving neurocognitive function and reducing risk for dementia. Despite these promising results, prior PA interventions have had few African Americans making it difficult to stratify results by race to determine whether African Americans respond to PA in a similar manner and magnitude as whites. In addition, the terms `physical activity' and `exercise' are often considered unpleasant, painful, and fatiguing, which can negatively influence interest, enrollment, and long-term adherence. Methods that increase PA without using the term PA (e.g., dancing) could be effective at improving health outcomes while simultaneously having a wider impact on translation and long- term adherence. Here we propose an innovative and culturally sensitive method of increasing PA in older (60- 80 yrs) African Americans. We propose a randomized intervention where 180 older African Americans are assigned to either a moderate intensity African Dance group 3 days per week (N=90) or to an African Education group 3 days per week (N=90) for 6-months. Both before and at the completion of the intervention, we will collect a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and MRI metrics of brain health and function to identify biological pathways by which PA influences neurocognitive health in an African American population. This proposal has the potential to utilize community-based activities to improve health of older African Americans. In addition, it could establish a platform (i.e., dance) to implement future interventions targeting minority populations to reduce health disparities. We have three primary aims: Aim 1. Examine whether a 6- month African Dance intervention improves cognitive performance compared to an educational control group. Aim 2. Examine whether African Dance influences brain morphology, task-evoked neural responses, cerebral blood flow, and resting state connectivity. Aim 3. Explore potential physiological and socioemotional mechanisms of the dance intervention. We will collect measures of physical and psychosocial health such as waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, mood, anxiety, depression, and loneliness and examine whether intervention-related changes to these measures mediate improvements in cognitive performance. Narrative In this randomized clinical trial, we will examine the effects of African Dance and Africana Education on cognitive and brain function in older African Americans. We will be collecting a battery of cognitive, neuroimaging, psychosocial, physical function measures, and blood-based biomarkers to examine the outcomes and mechanisms of the intervention.",Rhythm

"Study of Aging Latinas/os for Understanding Dementia in HIV (SALUD HIV) HIV remains a major public health problem, particularly for the Latina/o population. US-dwelling Latinas/os are at increased risk for HIV-infection compared to non-Hispanic whites and suffer a disproportionate burden of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) which may be amplified with age. HIV-infected (HIV+) Latinas/os of Puerto Rican origin have the highest prevalence of HAND (~78%) of any group in the US (HIV+ Mexican Americans: 44%; African Americans: ~40%, & non-Hispanic whites: ~40%). Older HIV+ Latinas/os (50± years) appear to be at even greater risk for HAND and cognitive decline than their non-Hispanic white counterparts, and the pattern of cognitive impairment in HAND appears to differ by ethnicity. In the general HIV population, HAND is characterized by impairments in processing speed, attention, and executive functioning consistent with involvement of the frontostriatal circuitry. HIV+ Puerto Rican Latinas/os present an atypical amnestic memory profile more consistent with medial temporal lobe (MTL) involvement. Despite these important disparities, differing cognitive profiles and possible differences in affected neural structures, the literature on HAND in Latinas/os is almost entirely cross-sectional, does not include HIV-uninfected (HIV-) controls, lacks studies focused on brain integrity in this population, and has yet to examine the mechanisms underlying these disparities. Utilizing a culturally-tailored approach, the goals of this study are to investigate whether older HIV+ Latinas/os of Puerto Rican origin demonstrate worse patterns of decline in cognitive function and brain integrity compared to other ethnic/HIV status groups, and to uncover the biological (e.g., neuroinflammatory biomarkers [sTREM2, sCD14, sTNFR-II, & IL-6], cardiovascular burden) and sociocultural (e.g., acculturation, social adversity, stress) mechanisms conferring risk for neurodegenerative and cognitive changes in this population. To that end, this multidisciplinary study will deploy a longitudinal observational design with 90 HIV+ and 90 HIV-matched control adults (both groups will include: 70% Latina/o and 30% non- Hispanic white; aged 60-80 yrs) over 36-months. All participants will complete laboratory, neuromedical, multimodal neuroimaging, and comprehensive cognitive and sociocultural assessments. Longitudinal structural equation models will test relationships between ethnicity, HIV, and biological and sociocultural factors on cognition (global, learning, memory, & processing speed) and MRI brain indices (white matter lesion & MTL gray matter volumes; MTL intrinsic activity, & hippocampal intra-network connectivity). Addressing disparities in cognitive and brain health outcomes in Latinas/os offers a vital opportunity to elucidate HAND neuropathogenesis, disentangle the biological and sociocultural aspects of cognitive aging through the lens of HIV-infection, and identify modifiable factors to mitigate risk for cognitive decline. As this population is the fastest-growing sector of the US aging population, identifying culturally-relevant intervention targets to lower age-related cognitive morbidity in Latinas/os is key for promoting brain health equity and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV remains a major public health problem, particularly for the US Latina/o population who is at increased risk for HIV-infection compared to non-Hispanic whites, and suffer a disproportionate burden of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), which may be amplified with age. Utilizing a biopsychosociocultural theoretical framework, the proposed multidisciplinary study will investigate whether older HIV+ Latinas/os of Puerto Rican origin demonstrate greater declines in cognition and brain integrity compared to other ethnic/HIV status groups, and to examine the biological (e.g., neuroinflammatory biomarkers [sTREM2, sCD14, sTNFR-II, & IL-6] and cardiovascular burden) and sociocultural (e.g., acculturation, social adversity, stress) mechanisms increasing risk for neurodegenerative and cognitive changes in this population. Addressing dementia and HAND health disparities in Latinas/os is vital for public health to: 1) improve our understanding of biological and sociocultural aspects of neurosenescence and cognitive aging through the lens of HIV infection; 2) advance dementia research in other conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease [AD] & related dementias [ADRDs]) by offering greater understanding of sociocultural variations in the neuropathogenesis of dementia; 3) inform culturally-relevant and targeted interventions that could lead to better Latina/o cognitive and health outcomes in HIV and other chronic conditions that disproportionately burden this population (e.g., AD, ADRDs); and 4) provide a framework for studying and addressing dementia and HAND in Latin American countries that also bear a heavy HIV burden.",Study of Aging Latinas/os for Understanding Dementia in HIV (SALUD HIV),9949264,R01AG065110,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cognition ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Memory ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Morbidity -

"Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks Project Summary Translational studies showing a mechanistic interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and sleep/circadian disruption has renewed interest in the maxim ‘sleep is of the brain, by the brain, and for the brain’. Relative to adults sleeping well, those exhibiting sleep deficiency (SD), defined as poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment, have greater AD risk (OR=1.55), cognitive decline (OR=1.68), or preclinical AD (OR=3.78). Since SD is observed early in the course of AD, it constitutes a prime target for prevention. Notwithstanding successes in delineating the mechanisms and functions of sleep, a critical gap remains in elucidating factors undergirding sleep disparities among blacks, marked by a greater AD risk burden. Blacks also shoulder a greater sleep burden as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the main SD indices, which are linked to increased vascular risks, inflammation, brain injury, and cognitive impairment. The multi-disciplinary team will utilize innovative dynamic and geospatial modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants of SD and its putative effects on the brain health of older blacks. We will leverage the success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup, comprising investigators with expertise in aging research, translational sleep and circadian sciences, brain health, health disparities, and geospatial and multi-level dynamic modeling. We will leverage the social capital and assets of our Community Steering Committee to enroll 504 blacks (60-75 years) from traditional and non-traditional venues to capture study endpoints. We will investigative the following aims: 1) To ascertain the psychosocial (social/emotional support, mood, discrimination, attitudes) and environmental (household [density, noise, air quality, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with SD; 2) To assess effects of SD on markers of brain injury (Hcy, NFL, GFAP, Tau & Amyloid-β peptides) and on neurocognitive functions (attention, language, memory, and executive function using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and Trail Making Test). The contributions of vascular risk (obesity, BP, lipid, and glucose/HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) will be weighted; 3) To characterize blacks who are at increased risk of SD using Bayesian machine-learning modeling and forecast through Agent-Based modeling which amalgamation of psychosocial and environmental changes will lead to a reduced SD burden and related brain health profile among older blacks over time (5, 10, & 20 yrs.). The investigative team will use novel home-based digital recorders, innovative brain health biomarkers, geospatial analytics and dynamic systems modeling to describe the mechanisms of SD and delineate their potential role in explaining observed disparities in markers of brain health of older blacks. Project Narrative Despite the high risk for sleep-related morbidity, there is a paucity of data on sleep-disrupting psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with sleep deficiency (poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment) among older blacks. Our multi-disciplinary team will use novel mHealth devices recording sleep/activity cycles, light, noise, air quality, temperature, and greenspace exposure; novel brain biomarkers; and geospatial analytics to assess effects on sleep deficiency and delineate their role in explaining disparities in the brain and cognitive health of older blacks.",Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks,9976783,R01AG067523,"['Activity Cycles ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Exhibits ', ' Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein ', ' Astroprotein ', ' GFA-Protein ', ' GFAP ', ' Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein ', ' Glial Intermediate Filament Protein ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Maxim ', ' Memory ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity -

"Cognitive impairment in Mexican Americans: a population-based study Abstract Hispanic/Latinos will comprise more than 30% of the U.S. population by mid-century, and Mexican Americans account for the largest share of this growing segment of society. This proposal aims to use door-to-door surveillance in Nueces County, Texas, a non-immigrant, bi-ethnic community, to determine the prevalence and trajectory over time of cognitive impairment and dementia in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will elucidate the mechanisms that explain the hypothesized ethnic disparity in Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer-related dementias by evaluating the roles of vascular disease risk factors, educational attainment and socio-economic status among others. This research will also delve deeply into the differences in informal caregiving for Mexican American and non-Hispanic whites with cognitive impairment and dementia. Caregiver burden and mental and physical health of caregivers will be examined toward efforts to develop interventions that build resilience in caregivers. A novel ability of this population-based study is to examine community resources for both patients and caregivers, and how these provisions differ by ethnicity. Using a rigorous mixed methods approach we will identify the gap between available resources and needs for those with cognitive impairment and dementia. In this way we will be well positioned to propose ethnic-specific testable interventions that promote mental and physical health for those with cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as for those family members who provide the care. This research will therefore lead to improved well- being, autonomy and outcomes among those with cognitive impairment and dementia and their caregivers. The investigative team members have conducted research in this community for 20 years and are experts in Mexican American culture and health, cognitive impairment and dementia, epidemiologic methods, community needs assessment and health behavior research. As the Mexican American population continues its tremendous growth and aging it is vitally important to better understand the prevalence and outcomes of cognitive impairment and dementia in this population, and to rapidly develop interventions that address the burden of these common conditions in Mexican American adults, families, and communities.

"Preventing Cognitive Decline and Dementia Among Older Chinese Immigrants: The Role of Activity, Engagement, Immigration Experience, and Neighborhood Environments 7. Project Summary/Abstract This proposed study aims to investigate the preventive effect of activity engagement profiles (AEP) on cognitive decline and to examine whether AEP mitigate immigration-related and neighborhood-related risks for dementia among community-dwelling US Chinese aging immigrants. With a fast growth rate, the US Chinese population increased from 2.9 to 4.9 million between 2000 and 2015, with 14% of them aged 65+ years. The lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer and related dementias (ADRD) in this population is comparable to that of non-Hispanic Whites. Our preliminary data analysis indicated that over 15% might have the presence of cognitive impairment (CI) at baseline, and about 8% incident CI at two-year follow-up interviews. The rapid growth of ADRD and of recent immigration of Chinese older adults call for population-based health interventions that are built on everyday activities. Guided by the community-based participatory research principles we have collaborated with over 20 community-based organizations and social services agencies in the Greater Chicago area. As such, four-wave PINE data (T1:2011-13; T2:2013-15; T3: 2015-17; T4:2017-19) have been collected. To our knowledge, PINE is the only longitudinal epidemiological study that has collected cognition data in a population-based sample of US Chinese older adults. In this secondary analysis of the largest and most comprehensive study of US Chinese aging population, we will consolidate discrete activity measures into unique patterns of AEP based on activity type, amount, and change over time. We will develop a database of Chinese immigrant communities by linking the PINE respondents’ residential census tract in 2010 with the individual-level data. We will test the validity of cognitive assessment using modern psychometric methods in this understudied population. The cognitive benefits of AEP will be examined in conjunction with immigration-related factors, individual characteristics, and neighborhood characteristics (e.g., ethnic density, neighborhood socioeconomic status, social cohesion, social disorder) using latent growth modeling approaches. Specifically, we aim to 1) examine the preventive effects of AEP on change trajectories of cognition; 2) assess whether AEP modify the effects of immigration-related factors on cognitive decline; and 3) assess whether AEP modify the effects of neighborhood factors on cognitive decline. Findings will point to activity intervention strategies based on distinct engagement patterns, the interplay between individual and neighborhood characteristics, and the person-environment fit wherein Chinese older adults can rely on and optimize neighborhood resources in cognitive promotion. Interventions based on daily activities that meet individual needs and fit in the context are urgently needed and would be cost-effective to address cognitive impairment and increasing burden on family caregiving. The present study will inform how active engagement with life and maintenance of cognitive function are interrelated to define and shape the aging process, which is especially important to older Chinese immigrants facing linguistic and social isolation. 8. Project Narrative This project will conduct the first comprehensive epidemiological study to investigate change trajectories of cognitive function and the preventive effects of activity engagement profiles, examining the risk and protective factors associated with immigration experience and neighborhood contexts in the aging Chinese immigrant population. This is consistent with NIH's goal of improving health equity and reducing health disparities in all racial/ethnic groups. Findings will have significant implication for developing cost-effective daily activity interventions for Alzheimer and related dementias (ADRD) and building supportive environments to promote cognitive health in the understudied population.","Preventing Cognitive Decline and Dementia Among Older Chinese Immigrants: The Role of Activity, Engagement, Immigration Experience, and Neighborhood Environments",9973330,R01AG067548,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Censuses ', ' Chicago ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Maintenance ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' rapid growth ', ' displaced people ', ' forced migrant ', ' involuntary migration ', ' displaced person ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' protective effect ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' family care giving ', ' family caregiving ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' cognitive benefits ', ' active life style ', ' active living ', ' active lifestyle ', ' protective factors ', ' enthusiastic atmosphere ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' supportive atmosphere ', ' supportive environment ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' social cohesion ', ' burden on families ', ' burden to families ', ' familial burden ', ' family burden ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,572160,0.040281822531815496
"Determining the effects of neighborhood disadvantage in preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The social and economic environment in which we live has a major impact on our physical and mental health and risk of developing diseases ranging from cancer to major depressive disorder to heart disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death and a major, and rising, contributor to health care expenditures in the United States. Socioeconomic disparities exist in the diagnosis, treatment and outcomes related to AD and socioeconomic disadvantage is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Understanding how exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage leads to increased AD risk could provide insight into new treatment and prevention efforts targeted at the most vulnerable populations. Despite this critical need, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and AD are currently unknown. To address this understudied topic, the proposed project will couple a validated, multi-dimensional index of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage with a rich longitudinal dataset including state of the art neuroimaging, cognitive testing and biochemical data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's disease Prevention (WRAP) and Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center study cohorts. Preliminary data generated for this project suggests that exposure to high levels of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage in cognitively unimpaired late-middle aged adults is associated with worse performance on a memory task, decreased volume of the hippocampus (a brain structure critical for memory processes) and elevated levels of AD biomarkers in the cerebral spinal fluid. These findings suggest a relationship between high levels of neighborhood disadvantage and pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease pathology in late middle age, a time of increased risk for eventually developing AD. The proposed project will specifically interrogate the relationship between exposure to neighborhood disadvantage in late-middle age and 1) longitudinal decline in performance on memory-related cognitive tasks, 2) longitudinal atrophy in associated memory- related brain regions and microstructural white matter changes in tracts connected to those regions and 3) how AD pathology (amyloid and tau) moderates these relationships. The results of this study will provide insight into the relationship between exposure to neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage during late middle age and preclinical AD. These studies will lay the groundwork for subsequent mechanistic studies of these relationships and can help inform policy targeted at ameliorating disparities in Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease disproportionately affects people with high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage, but little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that explain this relationship. This research project combines a robust metric of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage generated from the U.S Census and American Community Survey with neuroimaging and AD biomarker data from the longitudinal Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohorts to uncover relationships between neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage and pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease pathology. The results of this research will provide insight into potential pathways by which exposure to high levels of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases the risk of AD, and will have implications for addressing known disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",Determining the effects of neighborhood disadvantage in preclinical Alzheimer’s

"Development of a Faith-Based intervention in Dementia Caregiving Project Summary: Black Americans (BA) have a substantially higher occurrence of dementia compared to whites, experience delayed diagnoses and higher morbidity and mortality rates, and disproportionately receive dementia care and education. This disparity in addition to barriers such as the belief that memory loss/dementia is a normal part of aging, past discrimination in health services, and associated stigma, leaves the burden of care to informal caregivers. BA more often receive assistance at home (rather than nursing institutions) from family caregivers (CG) who also have the responsibility of making health care decisions for those who lack decisional capacity, and without prior information and training to prepare them for surrogate decision-making. There is an urgent need to increase knowledge about dementia and its risk factors (e.g., hypertension, sleep, stress, high cholesterol, diabetes, hearing loss, and depression) to minimize risks of cognitive decline, and improve brain health across the life course as this may lead to preventive measures, and timely diagnosis. We partner with the Black church to facilitate the adoption of a dementia education program with dementia caregivers, those diagnosed with mild dementia, and their family. Aim 1: Synthesize qualitative focus group data to disseminate in the Black American faith community, among church leaders and stakeholders. Complete analysis of qualitative data, foundational work supported by HCHDS, collected from 3 local Black Churches, and present findings back to participants and church leaders. Aim 2: Adapt current dementia caregiver educational materials and resources from USAgainstAlzheimer's (US2A) organization to use within church health/ wellness ministries. 1. a. Meet with previous church leaders from Aim 1 and newly recruited stakeholders and leaders appointed by the church pastor to adapt current caregiver educational materials based on the findings from aim 1 and b) identify delivery characteristics (e.g. words to describe, timing and approach to introducing dementia and brain health education, as well as background and skills of selected facilitators of program) to inform activities in Aim 3. 1. b. Train ministry leaders and appointed church congregants to facilitate dementia educational workshops with parishioners. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability of delivering church-based dementia education program, and examine the potential effects on participant knowledge gained, and satisfaction with the educational program among dementia caregivers. We will pilot test an educational intervention at 2 churches with dementia caregivers and those with mild dementia, and their families utilizing adapted materials from the US2A organization in a one day (6 hours) workshop consisting of three modules, 1) dementia awareness, 2) treatment, and 3) preventative measures.

"Metabolomics of Neurocognitive Risk for Dementia in Diabetes Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major epidemic associated with significant burdens on patients, families, and the public healthcare system. Its rise in prevalence is concomitant with an increase in diabetes-related comorbidities. Among these, diabetes has emerged as a reproducible risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying the risk for dementia in the disproportionately burdened T2D populations are poorly understood. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that metabolomic signatures of neurocognitive trajectory are present in diabetes and these signatures explain, in part, race disparities in cognitive decline between European Americans and African Americans with T2D. This hypothesis will be explored by re-examining the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS) cohort for neurocognitive trajectory using a well-established cognitive battery, literacy testing, and adjudicated physician diagnosis of dementia. Because neurodegenerative conditions, representative of cognitive decline, are progressive with pathology developing years prior to the observation of clinical symptoms and functional deficits, untargeted metabolomic analysis will be performed on baseline samples collected >10 years prior and correlated with cognitive trajectory. This approach offers the potential to identify relevant biomarkers before onset of overt disease. Finally, a comprehensive genetic analysis of the DHS participants to examine the genetic architecture of neurocognitive measures and metabolomic signatures of neurocognitive change will be performed. The composition of this study, inclusive of European American and African Americans participants, will provide generalizability of the findings. The timing of this study is critical to contrast changes in midlife to early-late adulthood to identify first stage pathophysiological changes facilitating the identification of relevant biomarkers with potential to improve the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify metabolomic signatures of cognitive trajectory in an aging adult cohort with comprehensive clinical (measures of subclinical vascular disease) and genetic data.",Metabolomics of Neurocognitive Risk for Dementia in Diabetes,9964315,R01AG058921,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart ', ' Joints ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' literacy ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Neurocognition ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' cognitive development ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' protective factors ', ' genetic architecture ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk prediction model ', ' clinical exam ', ' clinical examination ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,34586,0.1333742419690619
"Integrative Genomic Approaches for Understanding Sex Differences in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Women make up nearly two-thirds of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases in the United States and these differences are likely due to contributions from differential genetic and environmental effects between the sexes. While several candidate gene studies have identified sex-specific associations, no large-scale, genome- wide, sex-specific association analysis of AD has been conducted. Furthermore, the functional underpinnings of sex-specific genetic associations and how they relate to expression and epigenetic variations, are still largely unknown. We hypothesize that multiple genetic, epigenetic and gene-expression changes operate in a sex-specific manner to explain at least part of the sex disparity in AD prevalence. To this end, we propose new strategies for integrative analysis of DNA variants, gene expression, splicing and DNA methylation in a sex- aware framework, which will allow us to prioritize variants with the most regulatory potential and provide additional insight into the biological mechanisms of sex differences in AD. To accomplish these goals we will leverage existing large-scale genetic data from several consortia studies in AD, as well as expression and methylation data from brain tissue of AD cases and healthy individuals. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the sex-specific genetic architecture of AD through association and genetic correlation analysis; 2) Conduct transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify sex-specific changes relevant to AD; 3) Conduct region-centric analysis to identify sex-specific DNA methylation changes that contribute to AD; and 4) Prioritize sex-specific loci and develop sex-specific polygenic risk scores for AD through integrative analysis. Successful completion of this project will deliver the first large scale sex-specific genome-wide analysis of AD. It will also provide a paradigm for comprehensive and integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in a sex-aware framework. By focusing on integrative analysis of multiple types of `omics data, our study will provide a more complete understanding of the genetic and epigenetic programs underlying sex differences in AD, which will lead to better prevention, diagnosis and individualized treatment strategies. Project Narrative Women are approximately twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. This is likely due to an interplay of genetic and environmental factors acting differently in men and women. This project seeks to explain these sex differences.

"Marital Biography and Risk of Dementia in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  With the rapid aging of the U.S. population, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias have emerged as a serious public health problem. Identifying the risk/protective factors of dementia is crucial in designing evidence-based interventions to reduce dementia risk in late life. Marital relationships have long been recognized as one of the most important social relationships that affect individuals’ well-being throughout adulthood. However, little is known about whether and how marital relationships are related to dementia risk in late life. This study is designed to enrich our understanding of how marital biography influences the risk of dementia among adults ages 65 years and older in the United States. Guided by the life course perspective, the project has three specific aims. AIM 1. Examine the associations between marital biography components and risk of dementia in late life. We will examine whether and to what extent major components of marital biography influence dementia risk over the 18-year period in the United States. We hypothesize that marital instability and longer duration in unmarried states are associated with a higher risk of dementia. AIM 2: Identify the mechanisms linking marital biography and the risk of dementia in late life. We will test four potential mechanisms that could explain the associations between components of marital biography and the risk of dementia: 1) economic resources (e.g., income, wealth, and access to health care), 2) psychosocial factors (e.g., social integration and depression), 3) biomedical (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke), and 4) health behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking, and exercise). We hypothesize that the combination of these four factors will account for a significant proportion of the differences in dementia risk among people with different marital biographies. Aim 3: Examine sex and race differences in the associations and mechanisms discussed in Aims 1 and 2. Data will be drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2016). Discrete-time hazard models will be applied to predict dementia risk. The proposed project will provide the first in- depth and systematic analysis of how marital biography influences the risk of dementia in late life.

"The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study Project Summary Identification of successful prevention and treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has remained elusive, partially because clinical symptoms of AD have a late presentation in disease development, but also because there are not clear targets directly related to AD neuropathology for which definitive treatment is available. Thus, focusing on possible treatment and prevention targets that can be identified well before onset of clinical disease and which are known to be treatable is critical in addressing AD. The vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia, including AD, offers an important opportunity for prevention and treatment. Further, evidence suggests that vascular risk factors, including hypertension and diabetes, as well as brain cerebrovascular changes (i.e. white matter hyperintensities), contribute most to the development of cognitive decline and dementia when they are present in midlife (well before clinical AD usually presents). Some of this evidence has been established by the ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a community-based biracial cohort study of individuals from four US communities, with nearly 30 years of vascular risk factors and marker data, and its primary ancillary study, the ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC- NCS). The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study, the renewal of which is being proposed in this application, built on the valuable data available in ARIC and ARIC-NCS. By focusing on brain amyloid-β deposition, which in leading hypotheses is responsible for the development of AD, the ARIC-PET study further evaluated the associations between midlife vascular risk factors and AD. In the initial phase of this study, we completed 347 brain amyloid PET scans, using florbetapir PET, among participants from three ARIC sites. We found higher rates of brain amyloid in participants who were older, female, carried an APOE ϵ4 allele (the primary genetic risk factor for AD), and who were of black race. Although our data did not support a general association between midlife vascular risk factors and brain amyloid, for persons with “two hits”: a high genetic risk (carriers of an APOE ϵ4 allele) and elevated midlife vascular risk, our data do suggest more brain amyloid deposition. Finally, our data suggest that cognition is worse among participants who have both elevated brain amyloid and high amounts of brain cerebrovascular disease, on MRI. This renewal application proposes a repeat brain MRI and florbetapir (amyloid) PET scan among all surviving non-demented participants of ARIC-PET, to evaluate how vascular risk factors and brain subclinical vascular changes and APOE genotype each contribute to the progression of brain amyloid as well as the progression of clinical cognitive status, including conversion to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Further, we will evaluate progression of brain cerebrovascular changes as a risk factor for progression of brain amyloid and clinical cognitive status, which we hypothesize may provide a critical link to explain some of our observed racial disparities in amyloid deposition rates. The ARIC-PET cohort provides unique data in a biracial sample; data from its renewal could identify important targets for prevention. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that vascular risk factors play a major role in the development of dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET Amyloid imaging study used PET scans to further understand the role of vascular disease in Alzheimer’s, and the studies proposed in this renewal will test how change in vascular disease relates to change in brain amyloid and cognition. Vascular risk factors and vascular disease may represent a treatable way to reduce the burden of dementia in the US and worldwide.",The ARIC-PET Amyloid Imaging Study,9925759,R01AG040282,"['Alleles ',

"Disparities in the Life Course Origins of Cognitive Decline Disparities in the Life Course Origins of Cognitive Decline Project Summary/Abstract  A growing number of studies reveal that Black (African American) and Hispanic Americans have markedly higher prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia than do White (non-Hispanic) Americans.1-3 Despite the evidence, the reasons for the disparities remain a subject of continuing debate. In addition, the relatively modest literature on longitudinal studies of cognitive decline have been mixed, with some studies demonstrating equivalent or slower rates of decline,4-6 and others reporting faster rates of decline for minorities compared to older Whites.7-9 Discrepancies in these findings may be due to differences in the life course origins of cognitive decline. The purpose of this project is to explicate the life course origins of cognitive decline and the resources that mediate those relationships.  We investigate the influence of life course stressors on the risk of cognitive decline in later life among Black, White, and Hispanic Americans as well as the resources that reduce the risk of cognitive decline in these three groups. We focus on cognitive decline—an important hallmark of the development of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD)—and seek to identify resources that empower diverse groups of Americans to reduce the risk of early cognitive decline. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation is a mechanism by which stressors accumulated over the life course exact a toll on cognitive functioning but that this is remediable via social, psychological, and community resources. Although most of the extant research on the topic examines White adults, the present study investigates whether the mechanisms vary for Black, White, and Hispanic Americans. Resources such as social relationships and lifestyle factors vary across racial and ethnic communities, suggesting the value of investigating distinct mechanisms for amelioration.  We use eight waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), organized in two studies, to test hypotheses. Study 1 examines data from 9,872 adults (age 65+) in 2004 who are re-interviewed biennially, providing 14 years of observation. Study 2 uses information from 9,879 adults (age 65+) in 2010, incorporating rich data from the Life History Surveys launched in 2015 and 2017. There are three specific aims: 1. To examine disparities in the relationships between life course stressors and cognitive decline—an  important hallmark of the risk of ADRD. 2. To identify whether chronic inflammation is a mechanism for how life course stressors influence cognitive  decline among Black, White, and Hispanic older adults. 3. To determine if the life course resources that potentially mediate the relationships between life course  stressors and cognitive decline are distinct for Black, White, and Hispanic older adults.

"Enhanced Dementia Instruction and Tool in Home Hospice Care (EDITH-HC) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term objective of this K99/R00 application is to develop Dr. Elizabeth Luth’s capacity to conduct studies aimed at reducing caregiver burden and improving care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) nearing the end of life. In the K99 phase, the proposed project supports Dr. Luth in four training objectives that will allow her to develop and transition to an independent investigator who creates culturally inclusive, practical, and scalable solutions to improve end-of-life care for patients with dementia. First, she will extend her knowledge in core substantive areas including hospice care, dementia caregiving, and recruitment and retention. Second, she will learn to develop, implement, and disseminate behavioral interventions with an emphasis on clinical care settings, workforce training, and collaboration with community partners. Third, she will learn how to design and conduct clinical trials for ADRD patients and caregivers. Finally, for the fourth training objective, Dr. Luth will pursue professional development opportunities, specifically in the areas of grant writing and collaboration. The four research aims of this application will proceed as follows. Aim 1 will identify common challenges, strategies, and gaps in care for an understudied population; that is, community-dwelling patients with dementia near the end of life. This aim is achieved through interviewing and surveying African American and white family caregivers and hospice clinicians. Aim 2 uses key stakeholder (family caregivers, clinicians, experts) feedback to adapt dementia-focused training materials and to develop a problem solving tool for home hospice clinicians to improve care outcomes. Aim 3 examines the feasibility and acceptability of the training and tool and revises them based on an iterative feedback process with family caregivers and clinicians. Aim 4 determines the preliminary efficacy of the training program and tool to improve clinicians’ knowledge of dementia-related challenges in home hospice care, reduce family caregiver burden, and reduce hospice disenrollment through a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The proposed research works towards reducing disparities and achieving health equity by involving African American individuals in all stages of information gathering and intervention development and testing. The proposed project is consistent with the NIA’s mission to conduct behavioral research on aging and foster the development of research scientists in aging. It is also aligned with the NIA’s strategic goals of developing interventions to address Alzheimer’s Disease and improve the health of older adults in diverse populations. Dr. Luth proposes to pursue these development goals and begin the proposed research with the support of the Department of Medicine and Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, which provide an ideal environment of research support and resources to help her achieve her training and research goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project has the potential to increase our understanding of the challenges in caregiving for community-dwelling patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias nearing the end of life and strategies used to address those challenges. The project also has the potential to improve home hospice care delivery for patients with dementia and their family caregivers.

"Reducing Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer's-Type Dementia with MTM Services Compared to non-Hispanic Whites (Whites), racial/ethnic minorities suffer from higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and some associated vascular conditions, exhibit lower medication adherence, and incur higher healthcare costs. A critical barrier for resolving racial/ethnic disparities among AD patients is the lack of effective strategies to improve medication utilization among this population. Our Parent R01 examines the effects of medication therapy management (MTM) programs in the Medicare prescription drug benefit (Part D) on racial/ethnic disparities, but our original plan did not include AD-specific analysis mainly because of small sample size. With newly granted access to data for 100% Medicare beneficiaries, we now propose to examine the effects of MTM on medication utilization and health services utilization/costs among AD patients. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established MTM in 2006 to improve pharmacotherapy outcomes, but because of program design issues, CMS decided to modify MTM and launched a demonstration of the Enhanced MTM Model in 2017. While the existing MTM has been shown to lead to higher medication adherence among patients with vascular conditions, based on an interim report from 10/2019, Enhanced MTM failed to exert a positive impact on utilization of medications or health services. Our study will thus provide timely information when CMS ponders MTM policy options after completing the Enhanced MTM demonstration in 2022. Our long-term goal is to improve the health status of older adults among diverse populations by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization and health outcomes. We will analyze 100% Medicare Parts A/B/D data (2016-2017) linked to Area Health Resources Files. For medication utilization, we will measure initiation/discontinuation/persistence of antidementia medication and will apply utilization measures of medications, including those for vascular conditions, in Part D Star Ratings, a federal health-plan-quality evaluation system. Our expected outcomes include new information on: (1) effects of MTM on study outcomes among AD patients; (2) effects of MTM on racial/ethnic disparities in study outcomes among AD patients; and (3) measures of MTM utilization that exhibit disparity patterns among AD patients. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that MTM services have improved quality of medication utilization and reduced health services utilization/costs among AD patients. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that MTM has reduced racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization and health services utilization/costs among AD patients. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that racial/ethnic minorities received fewer/delayed MTM services than Whites among AD patients. Impact: Our results will provide empirical evidence to guide CMS policy-making for MTM, improve AD management, and assist the NIA/NIH in its strategic goals of “develop(ing) strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.” Because the existing MTM has been shown to improve medication utilization among individuals with vascular conditions, this study is highly likely to produce meaningful results. Our long-term goal is to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations by improving medication utilization and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in medication utilization and health outcomes. Our results will provide much-needed empirical evidence to guide policy- making by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, improve the management of Alzheimer’s disease, and assist the National Institute on Aging/National Institutes of Health in its strategic goals of informing “policy decisions,” and “understand(ing) health disparities and develop(ing) strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.”",Reducing Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer's-Type Dementia with MTM Services,10121850,R01AG040146,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Binomial Model ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physicians ', ' Policy Making ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Measures ', ' Medicare Part A ', ' Medicare Hospital Insurance Program ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Medication Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' health plans ', ' health plan ', "" Alzheimer's patient "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2020,380000,0.03220123869111679
"The UCSF Brain Health Assessment for the Detection of Cognitive Impairment Among Diverse Populations in Primary Care Efficient and user-friendly neurocognitive screens are needed that are sensitive to the variety of neurocognitive disorder presentations to primary care. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment was developed to efficiently measure the cognitive domains that can be affected in the earliest stages of neurocognitive decline, including memory, executive functions / speed, visuospatial skills, language, behavior, and function. Four subtests and an optional informant survey are administered via an appealing tablet interface and with automated scoring and provider feedback. Preliminary validation studies indicate excellent combined sensitivity and specificity to cognitive impairment among English-speaking older adults with moderate to high levels of education. The primary goals of the proposed work are to optimize and validate the BHA for older adults who are diverse in terms of education and language spoken, to perform cross-validation studies of other paradigms funded by this award, and to evaluate and address barriers to detecting cognitive impairment in primary care. Education and English as a second language each impact cognitive test performance and are barriers to accurate detection of cognitive impairment. This project will address these health disparities by including persons with diverse levels of education and persons whose primary language is Spanish, Mandarin, or Cantonese in both validation and implementation studies. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed English-speaking older adults with low, moderate, or high education. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed Spanish-, Cantonese-, or Mandarin-speaking older adults. In Aim 3, we will identify and address implementation challenges in primary care practices that serve patients diverse in terms of education and language spoken. If successful, this project will lead to increased detection of cognitive impairment in everyday community settings, which is essential to enable differential diagnosis and to improve medical management for people with cognitive impairment, including dementia, in the United States.

"Midcareer Investigator Award for Patient-Oriented Research in Dementia and Serious Illness Project Summary / Abstract Background: Healthcare spending is highly concentrated among a small seriously ill population. Yet, most high-cost patients are not in the last year of life and, despite high spending, quality of care for this group is often low, marked by poor communication, high burden of pain and other symptoms, and preference- discordant treatments. A key subset of this seriously ill population, persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, may experience the greatest burden of serious illness due to dementia's long course of illness, progressive functional impairment, and high degree of caregiver strain, the impact of which is often magnified among vulnerable and underserved subgroups. These issues are not well characterized over the course of illness and very little is known about the experience of those with both dementia and another serious illness, such as cancer or heart failure. Only by examining patient and families' experiences prospectively and over time can we begin to understand how these patterns are associated with patient care quality and family outcomes and thus appropriately target the interventions needed to improve care. Aims: Over the award period, I aim to expand my research and mentoring program by 1) building an innovative prospectively-framed sample, identified at onset of dementia, to examine patient and family outcomes (i.e., hospital and emergency department admissions, burdensome transitions, nursing home admission, and exhaustion of household wealth) over time; and 2) examining within this sample, differences in these patient and family outcomes between those with dementia compared to those who also have another serious illness (e.g., cancer). In both aims, we will also examine differences across vulnerable subgroups. Methods: Working in parallel across two nationally-representative, longitudinal cohorts, the Health and Retirement Study and the National Health and Aging Trends Study, linked to individual-level Medicare claims, we will identify incident dementia and other serious illnesses. By anchoring to the first observed date of illness, we will construct a longitudinal person-level dataset, including rich patient and family reported measures as well as healthcare claims. We will then use these data to examine the experiences and outcomes of older adults with dementia, with or without another serious illness, over time and also investigate disparities across vulnerable social and demographic subgroups. Public Health Significance: Older adults with dementia and other serious illnesses and their families are at risk for suffering due to low-quality, high-cost care, yet little prospective data on their experiences exist. This project will examine the longitudinal experience of those with dementia and their families beginning with the onset of dementia, and compare these experiences to those with another serious illness, such as cancer or heart failure. This study will also serve as a platform for mentoring junior investigators.

"Racial and Geographic Disparities in Risk and Survival of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Abstract There exists a limited number of studies that assess health disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and even fewer for non-AD dementias. Insight from existing literature and our preliminary studies suggest that the most essential health disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) are related to race/ethnicity effects in AD risk and strong geographic gradient in mortality from AD. Our preliminary studies showed significant gaps between incidence rates for different race groups and mortality rates between East and West coast populations. In addition less significant disparities related to effects in rural/urban subpopulations and differences in survival from AD/ADRD were also identified. Detailed epidemiologic descriptions of these disparities, especially incorporating subgroups of AD-related dementias (ADRD), are lacking and the role of behavioral factors, comorbidity, time-dependent cognitive trajectories, and genetic effects in the developments of AD/ADRD are not sufficiently evaluated. Thus, there is a critical need to quantitatively describe the persistent disparities in the AD/ADRD outcomes and clarify the role of the multiple contributing factors. Our preliminary studies proved the ability to extract high-quality measures of the factors to be studied from the three datasets to be used in this study: 5%-Medicare, HRS-Medicare, and SEER-Medicare as well as Multiple Cause of Death database. Research in the project will be focused on i) re-evaluation of the disparities by calculating them with better accuracy and addressing limitations of our preliminary analyses, ii) multiple analyses designed to explain these disparities by analyzing the effects of potential mediators, iii) incorporating recent advanced methodological approaches such as a new partitioning approach for the decomposition of an overall trend into its causal components for analyses of these disparities in high volume data, and iv) incorporating new concepts for the explanation of these disparities, such as the contribution of over/underdiagnoses, heterogeneity in disease severity at time of diagnosis, analyses of patterns of conditions related to AD and ADRD, and the contribution of AD resilience to these disparities. Four Specific Aims planned in this study will deal with i) epidemiology of AD/ADRD, ii) behavior factors and comorbidity, iii) cognitive status and the effects of diagnosis severity and over/under diagnosis, and iv) genetic effects and cognitive resilience. The completion of these Aims will results not only in robust estimates of the disparities in AD/ADRD outcomes in diverse populations, but also, ultimately results in improvements in public health that can be achieved through reducing the identified disparities in AD/ADRD using targeted information based on the in-depth analyses conducted in this project. The expected outcome will be detailed disease-specific information presented in a quantitative form that provides the contribution of each studied factor to race/income-related health disparities in U.S. older adults. We will uncover the barriers in health-care provision that can be further used for improving primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention in the U.S. resulting, in their turn, in improved survival and higher life span. Narrative The processes causing the disparities in health outcomes in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are not well investigated. The objective of this study is to provide a series of estimates characterizing the effects of specific variables that explain the relationship between population groups and differences in health outcomes. The results of the study will uncover barriers in health-care provision the removal of which will aid in the development of public health interventions and improvements in preventive care for these serious health conditions ultimately leading to improved longevity in the U.S.",Racial and Geographic Disparities in Risk and Survival of Alzheimer's Disease and Related

"Blood Pressure and ADRD in African Americans: the Jackson Heart Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are two to three times higher among African Americans (AAs) than among White older adults. Observational and clinical trial data, most recently from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial: Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (SPRINT-MIND), support that blood pressure is the most important modifiable vascular risk factor for MCI and dementia. However, the short duration of follow-up in SPRINT-MIND coupled with the failure to detect a statistically significant benefit of a lower blood pressure goal for incident dementia means that longer-term observational data will be necessary to fully address the implications of the clinical trial results. These questions are particularly salient for AAs, who have earlier onset of high blood pressure and are at higher risk of dementia, in particular cerebrovascular pathology. Even after considering race/ethnic differences in blood pressure level, the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in risk for dementia are not well understood. Additionally, despite facing a high burden of high blood pressure, some individuals are resilient, achieving better-than-expected outcomes. The specific factors that contribute to brain-health resilience are not well established. We propose to address these research gaps in an ancillary study to the 2020-2022 4th examination of ~2,700 participants in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an ongoing cohort study of well-characterized AAs. The JHS Exam 4 will include brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to ascertain cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration. We propose to add measures of cognition and function sufficient for classification of MCI and dementia, and innovative plasma biomarkers of amyloid (Ab42, Ab40), tau, and neurodegeneration (neurofilament light). The primary aims are as follows: Aim 1. Estimate the long-term associations of exposure to high 20-year time-weighted average blood pressure and blood pressure load on (1) cognitive performance; (2) prevalence of MCI and dementia; (3) markers of cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration quantified from MRI; and (4) plasma amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration. Aim 2. Examine whether sex, educational quality (i.e. reading level measured with the WRAT), and APOE-e4 and ABCA7 genotype, modify the associations of long-term exposure to high blood pressure and blood pressure load with cognitive outcomes. This study is responsive to PAR-19-070 and NOT- AG-18-047 (Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease) by adding cognitive assessments to a landmark cohort study of cardiovascular disease in AAs; leveraging existing and new data to understand risk and resilience factors for cognitive impairment; and drawing on the JHS cohort to understand vascular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in a minority population. This study is also proposed in the context of the updated National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer’s Association research framework in which the constructs of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration are featured prominently. Lastly, results from this study will inform future research and have implications for policies intended to improve brain aging in minority populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will quantify the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, examine the associations of long-term exposure to high blood pressure with established and novel measures of brain health, and determine the role of biologic factors and social determinants of health in modifying the risk of MCI and dementia among African Americans. The aims of the current proposal will both leverage extant data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), and add to the study measures of cognitive function sufficient for classification of MCI and dementia phenotypes and novel plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology at the JHS reexamination of cohort members in 2020-2022. This study is responsive to the recommendations from the National Alzheimer’s Project Act, and will both inform future research on vascular determinants of cognitive function and have significant

"The UCSF Brain Health Assessment for the Detection of Cognitive Impairment Among Diverse Populations in Primary Care PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Efficient and user-friendly neurocognitive screens are needed that are sensitive to the variety of neurocognitive disorder presentations to primary care. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment was developed to efficiently measure the cognitive domains that can be affected in the earliest stages of neurocognitive decline, including memory, executive functions / speed, visuospatial skills, language, behavior, and function. Four subtests and an optional informant survey are administered via an appealing tablet interface and with automated scoring and provider feedback. Preliminary validation studies indicate excellent combined sensitivity and specificity to cognitive impairment among English-speaking older adults with moderate to high levels of education. The primary goals of the proposed work are to optimize and validate the BHA for older adults who are diverse in terms of education and language spoken, to perform cross-validation studies of other paradigms funded by this award, and to evaluate and address barriers to detecting cognitive impairment in primary care. Education and English as a second language each impact cognitive test performance and are barriers to accurate detection of cognitive impairment. This project will address these health disparities by including persons with diverse levels of education and persons whose primary language is Spanish, Mandarin, or Cantonese in both validation and implementation studies. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed English-speaking older adults with low, moderate, or high education. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed Spanish-, Cantonese-, or Mandarin-speaking older adults. In Aim 3, we will identify and address implementation challenges in primary care practices that serve patients diverse in terms of education and language spoken. If successful, this project will lead to increased detection of cognitive impairment in everyday community settings, which is essential to enable differential diagnosis and to improve medical management for people with cognitive impairment, including dementia, in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early detection of neurocognitive disorders is highly beneficial for patients and families, yet cognitive impairment and dementia are frequently under-recognized. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment is designed to rapidly detect cognitive impairment in primary care and other everyday clinical settings. The proposed research will establish the feasibility of this assessment to increase cognitive impairment detection rates among patients with different levels of education and who speak English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin.",The UCSF Brain Health Assessment for the Detection of Cognitive Impairment Among Diverse Populations in Primary Care,10100827,UH3NS105557,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Data Collection ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Paste substance ', ' Pastes ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Specificity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Frequencies ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Educational Materials ', ' International ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' visual spatial ', ' Visuospatial ', ' user-friendly ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' stability testing ', ' Secure ', ' tablet device ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' neurocognitive disorder ', ' brain health ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' health assessment ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2020,72793,0.06448661145780235
"Critical Decision Making in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Mexican Americans Abstract With the continued growth and aging of the Mexican American (MA) population in the United States, we will see a tremendous expansion of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) in this important group. Understanding and reducing the impact of AD/ADRD in MAs is an important priority for public health and policy making. Currently, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the depth and determinants of disparities in AD/ADRD over time, and potential ways to lessen the impact of these disorders in MA communities. AD/ADRD affects not only the patient, but also family caregivers, who struggle with caring for a loved one facing an uncertain future with many complex decisions about their health and safety. These common yet difficult decisions such as driving cessation, nursing home placement, and use of life-sustaining treatments can have tremendous impact on both patient and caregiver across the spectrum of disease through the end of life. More data are needed on how the growing population of MAs approach these decisions and integrate socioeconomics, culture, and family. This information is necessary to develop future interventions to support these difficult decisions. MA culture also has strong values of family support that may have a positive influence on these decisions and help mitigate some of the negative aspects of caregiving. Using the population-based cohort of MAs and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) assembled from the highly successful “Cognitive impairment in Mexican Americans: a population-based study (R01 NS100687), we will extend the cohort follow-up to allow for enhanced understanding of ethnic disparities in AD/ADRD over time. The extended follow-up of this cohort will allow us to assess the longer-term trajectory of cognitive impairment affecting MA patients and caregivers and understand the prevalence, determinants, and impact of ethnic disparities in common decisions surrounding AD/ADRD. This project will address the following aims: 1) To extend the long-term assessment of trajectory and ethnic-specific predictors of progression to AD/ADRD, as well as the long-term life impact of AD/ADRD on families and caregivers, among a community-based cohort of Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites in Nueces County, Texas; 2) To assess the determinants and impact of decisions regarding two critical community transitions facing individuals with cognitive impairment: cessation of driving and transition to long-term skilled nursing facilities; and 3) To examine ethnic disparities in end-of-life treatment preferences among individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in a community-based cohort. This proposal will elucidate the impact of ethnicity and socioeconomic factors on AD/ADRD and related decision making across the aging spectrum and assist in the development of targeted decision support interventions among diverse populations. Narrative The Mexican American population in the U.S. is rapidly growing and aging. This project will study the relative development and long-term progression of cognitive impairment and dementia in Mexican Americans and non- Hispanic whites.

"ADRD plasma biomarkers and cognition in aging women with and without HIV infection ABSTRACT Chronic HIV infection is a 21st century phenomenon due to highly-effective medications called antiretroviral therapies (ART). Because of ART, people living with HIV infection are surviving to older ages when they are at risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). This has never been seen before. People living with HIV also experience cognitive problems and more nervous system illnesses related to the HIV infection. Women, in particular, are at higher vascular risk due to obesity and smoking, as well as certain types of ART that increase vascular risk. High vascular risk is related to ADRD. Identification of blood biomarkers that can tell us something about a person’s risk for ADRD is very important. A simple blood test will also help us better understand ADRD brain pathologies, or changes that lead to memory loss and clinical AD. Two of these pathologies are related to abnormal proteins in the brain, called amyloid and tau, and a third, is called neurodegeneration, or brain cell death. Vascular disease (blood vessel and circulation changes) is also common. Because women with HIV infection are already at high risk, exploring biomarkers of neurodegeneration and vascular health is paramount to understanding associations between HIV infection and ADRD, as well as cognitive impairments that come before ADRD. Candidate, state-of-the-art blood ADRD biomarkers include amyloid (A) proteins called Abeta-40 and Abeta42, and protein markers of brain damage called total tau (t-tau), phospho-tau (p-tau), and NeuroFilament Light chain (NFL). These biomarkers are usually measured in cerebrospinal fluid, the watery fluid that bathes the brain. Recent studies suggest that blood levels of these biomarkers may mirror levels observed in cerebrospinal fluid and are related to brain changes that occur in AD patients, such as brain shrinking due to nerve cell death, and other changes that may result from vascular disease. We have the great opportunity to explore repeated measures of these ADRD biomarkers Abeta-40, Abeta-42, t-tau, p-tau, and NFL, in association with cognition over 10 years in 390 women, who are at least 45 years old - 260 surviving with HIV infection and a comparison group of 130 uninfected women. This is an age when if AD were to develop, Abeta and tau would initially start to accumulate slowly and silently. We propose to use historical data from the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) WIHS women. In 2019, WIHS women were average 53 years old with measures of social, demographic, clinical, neurological and vascular outcomes, other illnesses, and risk factors, and ART use, as well as stored blood collected over time. In 2009, WIHS began cognitive measures every 2 years to measure different types of thinking, as well as global thinking. For the first time, we will link ADRD blood biomarkers to cognition over time in women with and without HIV infection. This will advance our understanding of brain aging in HIV. PROJECT NARRATIVE ADRD plasma biomarkers and cognition in aging women with and without HIV infection is an unexplored area of investigation and are keys to early detection of ADRD and identification of intervention windows. We will measure plasma Aß-40, Aß-42, T-tau, P-tau and NFL in stored plasma biospecimens from women enrolled in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (now MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS)), a longitudinal study of women with or without HIV infection.

"Alzheimer's disease biomarker disclosure in African Americans and Whites – Personal and programmatic consequences of knowing ATN status PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, using neuroimaging and spinal fluid procedures has shifted research towards symptom prevention and trials of disease-modifying therapies during the preclinical stage. Although AD is evolving from a clinical to a biomarker-based diagnosis characterized by amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (“ATN”), the psychological consequences of using this framework with cognitively unimpaired adults from diverse backgrounds remains unknown. Furthermore, few studies exist on AD biomarkers in African Americans, despite the increased prevalence and incidence of AD in this population. There is a critical need to understand how adults traditionally under-represented in research, such as African Americans, perceive AD biomarker-detected pathologic changes and to identify factors linked to positive (e.g., health-promoting behaviors that may reduce dementia risk) and negative (e.g., stigma and psychological distress) outcomes related to biomarker disclosure. In the absence of such knowledge, it will be difficult to develop ethical and culturally-sensitive biomarker disclosure approaches that minimize risk for negative psychological consequences. This gap, if left unaddressed, may contribute to continued difficulty recruiting and retaining African Americans into biomarker research, affecting the generalizability of those studies. The objective of this proposal is to identify personal/demographic, experiential, and AD-specific factors associated with willingness to enroll in biomarker research and subsequent likelihood for negative and positive outcomes related to disclosure. Results will be used to inform a future R01 application focused on developing and implementing ethical approaches for communicating biomarker information to a diverse population in a manner that minimizes stigma and psychological distress, empowers individuals to engage in health-promoting behaviors, and encourages enrollment and retention in AD-related research and clinical trials. This study proposes to conduct telephone-based surveys with cognitively unimpaired African Americans (n=150) and whites (n=150) enrolled in two longitudinal cohort studies, the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Our specific aims are to (1) identify factors that predict willingness to enroll in research measuring and disclosing AD biomarker data and (2) identify factors linked to negative and positive outcomes related to biomarker disclosure. Upon completion of these aims, our expected outcomes are to have identified factors associated with the decision to seek or avoid personal biomarker-disclosing research and the likelihood to experience negative or positive outcomes. This in turn is targeted to provide greater inclusivity of African Americans and other marginalized groups to participate in AD biomarker research. Research shifting the diagnosis and treatment of AD to biological markers without inclusion of these groups risks continued racial disparities in AD research, resulting in lower effectiveness in developing AD therapies that successfully generalize to the whole population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the push towards a biomarker-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be identified prior to symptoms, few studies exist on neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD in African Americans or on the psychological consequences of providing biomarker information to cognitively unimpaired adults.

"Reducing African Americans' Alzheimer's Disease Risk Through Exercise (RAATE) Abstract Alzheimer's Disease is steadily growing in prevelance, with a devastating public health impact. The prevelance of Alzheimer's Disease is higher in African Americans compared to white Americans, thereby constituting a health disparity. Interventions that prevent Alzheimer's Disease or change the course of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's Disease are needed. Most older adults do not achieve the recommended levels of physical activity, and this includes African Americans. Regular physical activity has proven to be a safe and effective means to enhance cognitive function in older adults ranging from cognitively healthy to mildly cognitively impaired. Therefore our study is focused on physical activity promotion, a potent approach to modifying multiple neurobiological pathways implicated in Alzheimer's Disease. We evaluate exercise benefits among elderly African Americans, who are understudied and in whom the natural course of neurodegeneration, exercise effects in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, and resulting clinical phenotypes may differ. A large body of exisiting data suggests that exercise improves cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, and thus has the potential to enhance perivascular clearance of amyloid and reduce chronic brain tissue ischemia, among other beneficial effects. At the same time, chronic exercise has been shown to decrease central levels of inflammatory markers and increase central levels of neurotrophic factors, which in turn promote protection against Alzheimer's Disease neurodegeneration pathways via a variety of mechanisms. While physical activity interventions have been shown to have positive effects on these factors and on resultant cognitive functioning in older adults, nearly all interventions have had a negligible representation of African Americans. Prior dara suggests that African Americans enter their elderly years against a backdrop of different lifespan exposures to a variety of factors relevant to neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, including cardiovascular risk, exercise, diet, and education. In addition, prior data suggests that the key genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Diease (APOE) may have differing consequences for Alzheimer's Diease risk among African Americans, and other genetic differences have the potential to influence the brain benefits of physical activity in this community. We will utilize a randomized clinical trial to address these questions. Participants will be randomized into a physical promotion intervention or a healthy aging information group for 52 weeks. All participants will be of normal cognitive function. We will assess cognitive function, brain structure and function, circulating hormones, objectively measured physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and telomere length. Our study will take the first step toward understanding whether the hypothesized benefits of exercise for the brain carry over to elderly African Americans. Narrative African American adults have two-times the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease compared to other ethnic groups. The current study (called “RAATE”) will determine if regular physical activity conducted over a year will reduce risk factors for developing Alzheimer's Disease in older African American adults. We will assess participants brain functioning, brain structure, memory, and chromosomes.",Reducing African Americans' Alzheimer's Disease Risk Through Exercise (RAATE),9869832,R01AG062200,"['Adult ',

"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: Renewal 2020 Steptoe, Andrew 2 R01AG017644-21A1 This application is for competitive renewal of funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) to cover two waves of data collection – wave 10 (2020/21) and wave 11 (2022/23). ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with the remaining funding coming from UK Government Departments (which have already agreed co-funding for these waves). The central aim is to provide a nationally representative population research platform for studying the unfolding dynamic relationships between mental, physical and cognitive health and functioning, economic position, social circumstances and well-being, as people move from work to retirement and into older age.  This application is focused on key current scientific issues relevant to population aging and public policy. These include the reasons behind the slowing in improvements in longevity at older ages; the interaction between genetic, biological, and psychosocial factors in healthy aging; the prevalence, determinants and economic and social consequences of dementia; the impact of retirement and later life labor market activity on health; the influence of pollution and other environmental exposures on health and cognition; the value of ‘social prescribing’ in health care; age discrimination and abuse; barriers to digital technology use among elders; and the role of early and mid-life experiences in aging. The new data needed to tackle these issues will be linked with existing waves, while innovations in methodology and linkage to registry data will be introduced to increase the value of the study for researchers worldwide while lowering costs and reducing participant burden.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are:  1. Introduce new measures of cognition and dementia, working patterns, social prescribing and social care, the use of digital technologies, domestic relationships and abuse, mental health, multimorbidity, early adult and mid-life experience, and actigraphy for measuring sleep and physical activity.  2. Maintain core content from previous waves on economics, social participation, cognitive function and dementia, health, biomarkers, genetics, social care, subjective well-being, and psychosocial factors.  3. Test and implement innovations in survey methods, including an ‘online first’ approach for some content.  4. Oversample ethnic minorities in the refreshment samples at each new wave.  5. Interview approximately 11,680 respondents in waves 10 and 10,770 in 11, with biomedical and physical performance data collection from 50% in each wave.  6. Build on the HCAP substudy to establish cross-walk to dementia and cognitive function in the full sample.  7. Create linkage with primary health care records, pollution data, and financial registry data.  8. Construct 11 waves of accessible and well-documented panel data, increasing accessibility and liaising with sister aging studies in the USA and elsewhere to maximize the international use of ELSA data. The increased longevity of the population is one of the greatest achievements of the modern age, but brings with it issues of concern to public health including more people with dementia, disability and chronic physical illness. Longitudinal data from large population samples help us understand the evolution of these issues, their determinants and their consequences for quality of life. The multidisciplinary English Longitudinal Study of Ageing provides a valuable complement to the US Health and Retirement Study, by collecting information about health and disability, cognitive impairment and dementia, social participation, wellbeing, biology, and genetics in a country that is in many ways comparable to the USA, but with contrasting profiles of social inequality and health and welfare systems.",English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: Renewal 2020,10051433,R01AG017644,"['Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid

"Rio Grande Valley Alzheimer's Resource Center for Minority Aging Research: Partnerships for Progress Summary OVERALL Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is an aging-associated disorder that disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who exhibit AD rates 1.5 times higher and average onset 7 years earlier than do older whites. Predicted growth of the US Hispanic population, particularly faster in Texas, portends further exacerbation of the disproportion- ate health and economic burdens of elevated AD in Hispanics. There is a shortage of researchers focused on AD and related disorders (ADRD) in Hispanics, particularly from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. To overcome these barriers, the proposed AD Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (AD-RCMAR) at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), one of the nation's largest Hispanic-serving institutions, will combine evidence-based mentoring and support mechanisms to develop and promote a first-rate regional and national cadre of researchers, particularly from under-represented groups, to analyze the complex mecha- nisms and interacting factors that contribute to Hispanics' disparate vulnerabilities to AD. The Center will sup- port identification of pathways and developmental time points at which changes in social circumstances and behavior can exert the largest favorable impacts on prevention and progression of AD among Hispanics. The UTRGV AD-RCMAR will exploit its unique resources to develop infrastructure and data collections that will at- tract and support researchers from multiple disciplines and at different scientific career stages, and allow them to conduct research aimed at reducing the impacts of AD on Hispanics. The socio-demographic profile of UTRGV reflects that of its local community, positioning the Center uniquely to advance studies of disparities in health and health care and contribute innovative solutions to improve minorities' health. We will achieve the Center's goals via 4 specific aims: 1) to identify, engage, mentor, and provide high-quality training and individu- alized career development support to outstanding faculty, especially from underrepresented groups; 2) to sup- port innovative, high-impact multidisciplinary pilot projects; 3) to provide expertise and resources for culturally- sensitive measurement and analysis of cognitive risk factors in older Hispanics, including behavioral, neuro- psychological, neuroimaging, and cardiovascular and genetic traits; and 4) to create the necessary expertise and resources to establish longitudinal research cohorts of older Hispanics and their families. We will achieve these aims through the creation of 4 Cores (Administrative; Research Education; Analysis; and Community Liaison/Recruitment) to support AD research. The Center will build upon the experience of investigators at the UTRGV Institute of Neuroscience and collaborators at the South Texas Diabetes & Obesity Institute, and Washington University's AD Research Center. Project Narrative Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is an aging-associated disorder that disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos, who represent the faster growing segment of the elderly population in the US and particularly in Texas. Build- ing on longstanding strengths in social, behavioral and biomedical research at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and facilitated by partnership with the Washington´s University Alzheimer´s Disease Research Center, the UTRGV AD-RCMAR will lead and coordinate an effort in South Texas to enhance the diversity of the research workforce of minority aging and develop infrastructure and data collections that will attract and support researchers from multiple disciplines and at different scientific career stages, and allow them to conduct research aimed at reducing

"Native Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR) OVERALL ABSTRACT American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) are increasingly concerned about Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), as these conditions will have a major impact on their communities. Although AI/ANs and NHPIs are culturally diverse and dispersed throughout the US, they share a high prevalence of ADRD risk factors. In addition, life expectancies for AI/ANs and NHPIs have improved over the last 50 years by as much as 30 years, resulting in a tripling of their population share of people aged 65 and older. The confluence of perceived need, high risk, and limited data motivates us to propose a Native Alzheimer’s Disease-related Resource Center in Minority Aging Research (NAD-RCMAR). Our research team offers unique scientific resources and opportunities as well as an extensive network of academic and community partnerships. Based at Washington State University (WSU), with collaborators at Stanford University and the University of Colorado, we will create an innovative program to understand, intervene on, and mitigate the ADRD-related health disparities experienced by AI/ANs and NHPIs. The Center’s theme will emphasize AI/AN and NHPI health disparities and aging from the individual to the population level. Our Research Education Component will fund meritorious Pilot Studies led by early-career investigators known as RCMAR Scientists. RCMAR Scientists will receive mentorship and training in methods, measurements, and study designs that meet high scientific standards and are culturally appropriate. They also will be mentored in the development of successful funding proposals so that they can pursue independent careers in ADRD research. Notably, 13 professionals who are either AI/AN or NHPI will participate as Co-Investigators, Consultants, or RCMAR Scientists. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Build infrastructure, assemble resources, and provide scientific expertise to enhance the diversity of the aging research workforce by mentoring promising junior and mid-level underrepresented minority scientists for sustained careers in ADRD research, focusing on AI/AN and NHPI populations; 2) Recruit RCMAR Scientists, especially those of AI/AN, NHPI, and other URM backgrounds, to conduct Pilot Studies in the social, behavioral, epidemiological, and clinical sciences on ADRD, and use these Pilot Studies as a vehicle for delivering mentorship and career guidance; and 3)Promote advances in ADRD research and increase the number of independent underrepresented minority researchers, with an emphasis on AI/AN and NHPI health faculty, who can address the health and well-being of AI/AN and NHPI elders, health disparities, and aging from the individual to the societal level. NAD-RCMAR will also capitalize on the national network of Satellite Centers created by Drs. Buchwald and Manson and led by AI/AN researchers. These Satellite Centers will ensure that our efforts are national in scope, especially our recruitment of RCMAR Scientists, our identification of datasets relevant to ADRD in AI/ANs and NHPIs, and our dissemination of results. This work will help address NIA’s research priorities for ADRD among underrepresented minorities, as articulated in the 2012 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Our Center responds to NIA’s interest in diversifying the scientific workforce. OVERALL NARRATIVE We will launch an effort to describe, understand, intervene on, and mitigate the Alzheimer’s disease health disparities experienced by American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. We will achieve this goal by funding social and behavioral Pilot Studies that advance the field, emphasizing the recruitment and mentorship of Native junior and mid-level researchers. These trainees will receive training on methods and analyses so that their work meets high scientific standards, while being culturally appropriate. This work will advance Alzheimer’s disease research and increase the number of independent investigators focused on Alzheimer’s disease disparities experienced by our target populations.",Native

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Ethnically Diverse Cohorts for the ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) PROJECT SUMMARY  The Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national sequencing initiative focused on identifying genetic risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in an effort to identify new pathways for prevention and new targets for drug development. The projects’ discovery phase included whole exome sequencing (WES) of 10,914 unrelated cases (N=5,778) and controls (N=5,136) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,019 familial samples. A majority of these samples are non-Hispanic white (NHW) in origin, making the addition of ethnically diverse samples to the study critical to identification of both shared and novel genetic risk factors for AD between populations. This ethnic diversity was emphasized in the ‘ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) Phase’ planning stage with a directive that additional existing cohorts with unrelated AD cases that ‘encompass the richest possible ethnic diversity’ be given the highest priority for inclusion.  To fulfill the goals of this RFA and this FUS Phase Mandate, this proposal identifies seven existing elderly cohorts of African-American (AA) and pan-HI ancestry with a total of 10,430 samples (N=2,322 AA AD cases and 1,843 AA controls and 2,928 Hispanic AD cases and 2,875 Hispanic controls) for WGS and processing in collaboration with existing NIH-funded AD infrastructure. Combining these cohorts with existing African America (AA) and Hispanic (HI) sequencing from the Washington Heights-Hamilton Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the ADSP will provide large ethnically diverse datasets for both validation of ADSP discovery phase findings and discovery of novel risk and/or protective variants for AD. Importantly, these data will allow for admixture mapping, a powerful method of gene mapping for diseases that show differential risk by ancestry, by comparing allele frequency differences between populations. They will also become an invaluable resource for the AD research community at-large, and will help to address the health disparities that contribute to AA and HI populations having higher rates of AD than NHW. Thus, we will address these important issues by creating a large dataset of AA and pan-HI AD cases and controls for study.  Specifically we propose to: 1) increase the ethnic diversity of the ADSP by assembling samples from existing cohorts with AA and HI AD cases and controls; 2) collaborate with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) in assemblage, storage, and distribution of DNA on these cohorts; 3) generating genome-wide SNP array data and WGS for all collected samples; and 4) collaborate with the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and The Genome Center for Alzheimer’s Disease (GCAD) in processing, quality controls, storage and distribution of the final datasets.

"Foundations of Representative Engagement, Valid & Effective Recruitment (FOREVER) in AD Research More than one-quarter of clinical trials in the United States fail to enroll a sufficient number of participants, introducing significant delay, cost, and uncertainty in evaluating the merit of promising clinical interventions and research designs. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) trials already face a shortfall of thousands of eligible participants, a number that will rise exponentially as primary and secondary prevention research opportunities develop over the next several years. Given this shortfall, advances in participant recruitment and clinical research design are urgently needed to address barriers to participation. While the identification and quantification of successful recruitment strategy is complex and multi-factorial, the field lacks empirically rigorous models and methods in the science of recruitment, engagement, and retention (RER). These factors are compounded for underrepresented and marginalized populations, and a dearth of peer-reviewed research on the optimization of recruitment tactics hinders our ability to address research recruitment disparities, and slows the pace of science for large observational studies, longitudinal projects, and large-scale clinical trials. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop robust mechanisms of efficacy in RER, a basic sciences approach to sustainable and inclusive recruitment into ADRD studies. The current proposal develops this science through deep community canvassing and data mapping tools to establish population norms on RER (Part 1), surveys ADRD research sites to develop innovative, data-driven RER novel metrics and interventions (Part 2), and establishes communications frameworks to improve literacy of RER and ADRD research for both research and lay communities (Part 3). This proposal thus develops, operationalizes, and implements innovative approaches to address challenges in effective research recruitment by advancing a mechanistic, theory-driven emphasis on RER. I focus on participation and recruitment barriers disproportionately experienced by racial and ethnic minorities; LGBT/queer populations; rural residents; native tribal communities; low income neighborhoods; individuals with less than a high-school education, and particularly the intersections of these identities . While this five-year proposal aims to firmly establish a sustainable science of RER for ADRD research, I also aim to leverage these innovations to both build and sustain reciprocal relationships between local, diverse communities and ADRD research study sites to advance progress in dementia research. Research studies and clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias attract smaller and increasingly less-representative populations, which may impact the effectiveness of scientific research; moreover, this is a problem set to grow in coming years. I propose the development of a testable, scalable science of recruitment, engagement, and retention to address this problem. This work will create a robust foundation, with information, tools, and literacy-building for research and lay communities, to support researchers and underrepresented communities working together to improve both the efficiency and inclusivity of research study samples.","Foundations of Representative Engagement, Valid & Effective Recruitment (FOREVER) in AD Research",10094911,DP1AG069873,"['Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' literacy ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Research Peer Review ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' tribal community ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' eligible participant ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' queer ', ' Homework Exercises ', ' Problem Sets ', ' racial minority ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' recruit ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' ']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,DP1,2020,3312624,0.0377481492528793
"ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS) Renewal The vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is a critical area of research related to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the AD-related dementias (ADRD), particularly given its value in identifying areas for intervention and prevention. This proposal is a renewal application to the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS), a community-based cohort from four U.S. communities, which, when first funded in 2011-2013, added detailed cognitive evaluation and adjudication of mild cognitive impairment (MCI and dementia, along with brain imaging and new vascular and cardiac markers, to 25 years of careful measurement and collection of cardiovascular risk factors, markers, and events through the parent ARIC study. Our previous studies have demonstrated the importance of midlife vascular risk factors in the development of later-life cognitive decline, dementia, and amyloid deposition, and, given the biracial structure of the cohort, have considered racial disparities in some of these risk factors and outcomes. In this renewal, we propose to not only study these cognitive impairments at older cohort ages with greater rates of MCI and dementia, in order to identify subsets which may offer potential avenues for late-life prevention of AD/ADRD's, but also to consider if similar midlife risk factors impact late-life physical function declines, as this may represent a parallel and possibly alternative pathway to prevention of both physical function impairment and AD/ADRD's. Furthermore, we will evaluate factors associated with maintenance of cognitive and physical function, as well as the concept of cognitive reserve: better-than-expected scores or less-than-expected decline for an observed level of brain pathology. To pursue these questions, we will perform annual visits of the ARIC cohort, for four total visits, with detailed neurocognitive testing and brain imaging with MRI and florbetapir PET in 1000 participants, to build upon the prior 30+ years' worth of detailed vascular risk factor and marker and lifestyle measurements, starting when participants were middle-aged. The size and diversity of our cohort allows us to conduct sex- and race-specific analyses. This renewal will provide valuable information about opportunities for prevention for AD/ADRD's, with direct relevance not only to the recent ADRD summit recommendations, but also the first goal of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) to prevent and treat AD by 2025. Through our ongoing data sharing endeavors and collaborations with other studies, as well as the opportunities provided for ancillary studies building on the ARIC NCS study, the study will reach beyond the proposed aims described here. One of the most promising avenues for prevention of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias is through the prevention of vascular risk. This renewal application will build upon our prior studies, which demonstrated the importance of midlife vascular risk factors in the development of cognitive decline and dementia, by also considering factors associated with maintenance of both cognitive and physical function. Finally, this study will identify potential targets for prevention by evaluating a concept called cognitive reserve, which refers to maintenance of cognitive function despite abnormalities seen on brain imaging; this set of studies could contribute to prevention and reduction in the worldwide burden of Alzheimer's and other dementias.",ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS)

"MyCog - Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings Cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia are significant public health burdens that can have profound social and emotional effects on older adults. Early detection of CI is imperative in order to identify potentially treatable underlying causal conditions, and in cases where cure is not possible, to provide supportive services to minimize the effects of CI. While primary care and other clinical settings are ideal places for identifying CI, it frequently goes undetected. Available screening tools may be unsuitable for implementation in such settings because of their length, cost, or need for specialized equipment or highly trained administrators. Our project, MyCog: Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings, will create a brief, readily available, standard set of CI screening measures applicable for use in diverse settings and with diverse populations. Comprised of two cognitive measures drawn from the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function® and the Everyday Cognition self- and informant-report measures and implemented as a downloadable app, MyCog will be validated in a large sample of older adults (ages 65+) enrolled in “LitCog III: Health Literacy and Cognitive Function among Older Adults”. Field testing MyCog within LitCog III will allow validation in multiple clinical workflows and in African-Americans, a health disparities population. Our proposed project will 1) Create a standalone MyCog App using existing NIHTB cognition tests and Everyday Cognition self-/proxy report measures that will report screening results as either “No CI detected”, or `CI detected” and provide follow-up recommendations and guidelines for each outcome; 2) Validate MyCog (UH3 Phase) in primary care settings and determine its sensitivity in detecting early indicators of CI using an existing cohort (LitCog III) of well-characterized, ethnically and racially diverse adults ages 65- 85; 3) Evaluate the success of MyCog clinical implementation in primary care settings; 4) Optimize MyCog for use in clinical settings by adjusting scoring algorithms to maximize efficiency and incorporating features that facilitate clinical integration; and 5) if selected to do so, coordinate consortium-wide activities. Cognitive impairment (CI) is increasing in the US as our elderly population increases, and therefore early detection of CI is critical for ensuring its appropriate management. This project will create a brief CI screening battery (the MyCog App), available in English and Spanish versions, that can be easily implemented in everyday clinical settings with diverse populations. MyCog, comprised of existing measures of cognitive function, will be validated in a large, general population sample of elderly individuals, including many African Americans and people with low socioeconomic status who are at increased risk of experiencing health disparities.",MyCog - Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings,10001644,UH3NS105562,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Americas ', ' Cognition ', ' Equipment ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' processing speed ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' LOINC ', ' Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' rapid detection ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' implantation ', ' usability ', ' primary care setting ', ' standard measure ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' clinical implementation ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,UH3,2020,1975525,0.02189676239387307
"Life Course Determinants of Epigenetic Age Acceleration and Subsequent Dementia PROJECT ABSTRACT  This proposal seeks to understand the impact of interactions between socioeconomic status (SES), genotype, and health behaviors on disparities in epigenetic age acceleration and cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. Under the guidance of primary mentor Dr. Sharon Kardia, the training and research plan will build upon Dr. Schmitz's expertise in health economics and genetic epidemiology to prepare her for an independent career that integrates social science, genetics, and epigenetics into aging research. The PI will pursue a program of training in epigenetics at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health that will advance her knowledge and skills in (1) epigenomic biology, (2) bioinformatics and related general programming, and (3) preprocessing and analysis of DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray data.  The proposed research plan will capitalize on a large sample of epigenome-wide data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (N=4,000) to construct measures of DNAm age in whole blood and test for associations with known genetic, social, and behavioral mechanisms of aging and cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease. DNAm age been shown to predict age with high accuracy, and studies have linked positive deviations between DNAm age and chronological age (i.e. epigenetic age acceleration (age)) with age-related diseases and mortality, suggesting that epigenetic processes may play a role in healthy aging. However, few studies have investigated pathways between age and SES, and to date no study has evaluated whether the relationship between age and SES is moderated by genetic influences or mediated by risky health behaviors. This work builds on Dr. Schmitz's prior HRS research that used whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) and objective measures of the social environment to examine the effect of gene-environment interactions on physical health and cognitive function at older ages.  During the K99 phase, Dr. Schmitz will construct measures of DNAm age in the HRS to test for associations between age and disadvantaged SES, risky health behaviors, and demographic characteristics using longitudinal moderation-mediation methods. During the R00 phase, Dr. Schmitz will incorporate PGSs into the analyses to assess whether genetic propensity for educational attainment or cognition moderates the relationship between SES, age, and subsequent declines in cognitive function and incidence of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Comparative analyses will be conducted in an African American oversample (Nൎ1,000). R00 research will employ instrumental variables (IV) and dynamic panel methods to draw stronger claims regarding causality. Following these analyses, replication of main findings will be pursued in multi-ethnic cohorts that have comparable genetic, epigenetic, and social data. Results from this research program may shed light on the specific social and biological mechanisms that underpin the SES-mortality gradient. PROJECT NARRATIVE Research that can evaluate the joint effect of social and biological forces on age-related disease is needed to more accurately inform future research and policy intervention that seeks to extend life expectancy and quality of life among older adults. This study capitalizes on a large pilot sample of epigenome-wide data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (N=4,000) to understand the impact of socioeconomic status (SES), genotype, and risky health behaviors on disparities in epigenetic age acceleration and subsequent cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease.

"UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Core Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT African Americans (AA) and Latinos, the two largest minority groups in the U.S., are disproportionality affected by Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) as well as a number of other comorbid medical conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, etc.). There is evidence from population-based studies that general rates of disability are higher among minorities, and thus Aim 1 will examine whether there are disparities in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) difficulties among AA and Latinos compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Understanding, preventing, and ameliorating potential health disparities is a major public health priority because poorer functional outcomes translate into disparities in quality of life and greater economic burden. Aim 2 will examine whether there are differences in key factors that are associated with functional abilities across groups. Regardless of whether there are disparities in overall level of IADL disability, there are likely to be different contributing factors (e.g., cognition, physical functioning, and medical co-morbidities). This study will address an important gap in knowledge about potential disparities and contributors to functional outcomes, which has important implications for developing effective public health policies and tailoring interventions. This supplement would allow Dr. Chan to reduce her clinical responsibilities and increase her dedicated research time, which would work towards her long-term career goal of developing an independent program of research in ADRD related disparities among ethnic minorities.

"Reducing Disparities in Dementia and VCID Outcomes in a Multicultural Rural Population ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect millions of Americans. Persons living in rural areas face increased prevalence (OR=1.1) and incidence (OR=1.2) of ADRD compared to urban/suburban dwellers with increased disparities affecting health outcomes. Underlying factors that may increase ADRD risk and disparities in health outcomes include: poverty; low education; poor health literacy; poor nutrition; tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse; limited access to care (specialists, diagnostic testing); migrant or marginal immigration status; and non- and underinsurance. In addition to rurality, race and ethnicity may play a role in ADRD. African Americans are 2 times as likely and Hispanics are 1.5 times more likely than Whites to develop ADRD that may be due to different risk profiles, particularly vascular risks. These social, biologic, and genetic determinants increase risk for multiple chronic conditions associated with vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We propose to study health disparities associated with ADRD and more specifically VCID in culturally heterogeneous older adults living in a rural setting compared with older adults living in an urban/suburban setting. Comparison populations reside either in the (a) western rural portion of Palm Beach County, FL (locally referred to as “the Glades”) or (b) the more metropolitan and affluent coastal portion of Palm Beach County (locally referred to as “the Coast”). The overall HYPOTHESIS is that rurality, combined with low SES, cultural characteristics, vascular risk factors, environment and lifestyle factors, and genetic traits synergistically increase the risk for ADRD and in particular VCID. These same factors contribute to disparities in health outcomes for rural populations compared to similar groups of older adults from urban/suburban communities. We propose these SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) Conduct a cross-sectional, population- based study of the Glades with phenotype and genotype of participants to determine the prevalence of ADRD/VCID; (2) Conduct a longitudinal study of individuals randomly selected from Aim 1 and compare to an age- and racial/ethnicity-matched sample of suburban/urban older adults recruited for longitudinal follow-up; (3) Evaluate cross-sectional relationships at baseline, 18mos, and 36mos between clinical, functional, psychosocial, genetic, and biomarker variables and cognitive performance for the cohort as a whole, and stratified by relevant biological variables; and (4) Model baseline and longitudinal clinical, functional, psychosocial, behavioral, genetic, and biomarker variables to predict cognitive impairment and rate of progression from normal cognition to MCI, and MCI to ADRD/VCID for the cohort as a whole, and stratified by relevant biological variables. Our short-term goals are to determine prevalence and profile of transition from normal aging to ADRD/VCID, in a rural population compared to urban/suburban settings; identify and characterize unique genetic and biomarker features; and explore social and biologic determinants of brain health. Our long-term goal is to reduce health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The unique combination of social, biological, and genetic determinants of health, cultural and racial characteristics, rural locality, vascular risk factors, and lack of access to care synergistically increase the risk for VCID. The proposed work will be among the first population-based studies specifically exploring the clinical, cognitive, biomarker, and genetic characterization of VCID in a multicultural, underserved, rural population.

"Cross Sectional and Longitudinal Racial Disparity in Molecular Biomarkers of Alzheimer Disease Currently, almost all molecular biomarker studies in Alzheimer disease (AD) and clinical trials on AD have been largely limited to Caucasian participants. The fundamental question is whether AD, as currently defined, is the same disease for African Americans, the largest under-represented group (URG) in the US, and Caucasians, both in the preclinical and symptomatic stages. Conflicting results have thus far appeared in the literature about this very question, largely due to the limited sample sizes of African Americans in published studies. We propose to tackle these problems by implementing a multi-center and longitudinal study with a central and standardized re-processing of all currently existing and prospectively collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural scans, and positron emission tomography (PET) beta-amyloid and PET tau imaging scans, in addition to a harmonization of clinical and cognitive outcomes. We will join forces with five major biomarker studies of AD: the Washington University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC), University of Pennsylvania AD Core Center, Emory University ADRC, Harvard Aging Brain Study, and the Anti- Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's trial. We will assemble likely the largest biomarker data set of African Americans, and analyze resulting AD biomarker and cognitive data in a comprehensive manner to examine the racial disparity in both the preclinical and the symptomatic stages. We will further assess the roles that AD risk factors, APOE ε4 status, family history, age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, and vascular burden play in cross sectional and longitudinal differences between African Americans and Caucasians. We will also determine the racial differences in the predictability of AD biomarkers to concurrent and longitudinal cognitive outcomes. These racial differences, if confirmed by the proposed study on the largest African Americans biomarker cohort, may imply potentially differential treatment responses between the races, and hence will have profound implications to the design and analyses of ongoing and future prevention and treatment trials of AD. This project proposes to assemble the largest biomarker cohort of African Americans for Alzheimer disease (AD) by leveraging on both the existing biomarker samples and data from five major biomarker studies of AD and prospectively collected biomarker samples and imaging scans from these studies. The potential racial disparity in molecular biomarkers of AD, as well as in their predictability to subsequent cognitive outcomes, if confirmed by the proposed study on the largest AA biomarker cohort, may imply differential treatment responses between races, and hence will have profound implications to the design and analyses of ongoing and future prevention and treatment trials of

"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Online Small-Group Self-Management Workshop for Rural Caregivers of Individuals with Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT SUMMARY  Among 13 million informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias, an estimated 1.4 million live in rural areas of the US. These caregivers are a vulnerable group due to their physical isolation and well-documented rural disparities in health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is an pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers so that they can sustain their own well-being and effective caregiving within the home environments of their loved ones.  Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home environment and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related forms of dementia. In our evaluations of the program in non-randomized studies, caregivers experienced significant improvements in stress, depression symptoms, and self-efficacy and partners experienced improved well-being.  Building on these encouraging preliminary findings, we now propose to conduct a hybrid effectiveness- implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: 320 in the intervention (workshop) group and 320 in the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited through 19 community organizations (serving rural communities in 17 states). Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depression symptoms. We hypothesize that stress scores and depression symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. We will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. We will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.  If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 13 million informal, mostly unpaid caregivers (“caregivers”) provide critical support to US adults living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, enabling them the remain in their homes and communities. But many dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to these responsibilities, including caregivers who live in rural settings where resources and support may be difficult to access. The proposed project will determine whether a 6-week online self-management and skills-building workshop called Building Better Caregivers improves the well-being of isolated dementia caregivers who live in rural settings and also whether the workshop has the potential to be widely disseminated to such caregivers throughout rural America.",Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Online Small-Group Self-Management Workshop for Rural Caregivers of Individuals with Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias,9939435,R01AG057855,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Program Accessibility ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Friends ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Family member ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' uptake ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' rural disparities ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' loved ones ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' attentional control ', ' care receiver ', ' care recipients ', ' Informal care giver ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia caregiving ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' stress symptom ', ' rural America ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' recruit ', ' self-management program ', ' clinical implementation ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' effectiveness implementation trial ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,793239,0.06764121251806139
"Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research ABSTRACT Despite experiencing Alzheimer’s-related health problems at a disproportionate rate, African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Insufficient enrollment of African Americans in this line of research is a nationally-recognized problem. This is highly concerning not only because of the need for unbiased, representative samples in basic science and clinical research, but also because involving persons from underrepresented minority groups is crucial to advancing our understanding of, and ultimately combating, health disparities. In response to PAR-15- 349 “Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease”, we propose to develop and evaluate a novel strategy that uses a storytelling campaign to enhance recruitment of African American adults into research at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center. In Specific Aim 1, we will build on our promising pilot work to refine and evaluate community members’ acceptance of a storytelling strategy for communicating Alzheimer’s-related research participation experiences of African Americans in mid and late life. The storytelling strategy will highlight African Americans’ research participation narratives, as derived from a series of ethnographic interviews and told using short videos. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the effect of this storytelling strategy on recruitment of African Americans into ADRD research. Videos developed in Aim 1 will be incorporated into all existing ADRC recruitment efforts, ranging from community events to social media strategies. The primary outcome for Aim 2 will be the proportion of African Americans recruited to the ADRC Clinical Core over an 18 month period, with the preceding 18 month period serving as the comparator. Specific Aim 3 will use path analysis modeling to explore the mechanisms by which a storytelling strategy increases enrollment of African Americans into ADRD research in general, and into a specific study designed to address health disparities. Realizing the goals of this study will increase racial and ethnic diversity in ADRD research at a leading NIA-funded ADRC and ultimately, help to reduce cognitive health disparities amongst African Americans. Findings from this study will directly inform best practices for increasing diversity within the national AD Centers network, with significant implications for a range of underrepresented populations. Furthermore, these findings will also have applications in other disease contexts in which scientific progress is constrained by insufficient recruitment of persons from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups. This project will examine how a strategy called storytelling may help to increase research participation among persons of African American ethnicity. The project will focus on recruitment to research studies related to Alzheimer’s disease, which is particularly important because 1) Alzheimer’s poses a substantial threat to public health, 2) African Americans experience Alzheimer’s-related health problems at disproportionately high rates compared to non-Hispanic whites, and 3) , African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Findings from this study will inform best practices for recruitment throughout the NIA-funded national network of Alzheimer Disease Research Centers, and resources developed through this project will be shared accordingly.",Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research,9918213,R01AG054518,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Support Groups ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' health economics ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' combat ', ' primary outcome ', ' social media ', ' Care giver support ', ' Caregiver support ', ' dementia care ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racial minority ', ' relative cost ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,568289,0.10309370202789803
"Old SCHOOL Hip Hop: A randomized controlled trial to improve dementia knowledge Objectives: The goals of this proposal are to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel culturally- tailored dementia education intervention to a) teach young children to recognize dementia symptoms and demonstrate an appropriate action plan (which we have termed dementia literacy) and b) have these dementia literate children teach and improve dementia literacy their parents and grandparents. Background: Dementia is common among elderly individuals, becomes more prevalent with age, is medically refractory, reduces life expectancy, and diminishes quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Cultural barriers to dementia diagnosis exist and are potentially modifiable. Interventions that target younger generations may shift cultural perceptions and improve acceptance of dementia and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Emerging evidence suggests that early cognitive impairment may have modifiable or preventable components and a combination of medical and lifestyle interventions may delay or reduce cognitive decline, particularly when delivered early in the course of disease. Health literacy, including perceptions of cognitive aging and awareness of possible modifiable determinants, could be unrealized barriers to diminishing the health disparity of dementia. Youth education programs focused on dementia could increase community dementia awareness, improve AD literacy of parents and grandparents of dementia- literate children, shift cultural perceptions of AD to improve its acceptance, and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Such an approach could uniquely engage minority populations who are least engaged and at greatest risk for AD. Methods: The Intervention. “Old SCHOOL Hip Hop” (Seniors Can Have Optimal aging and Ongoing Longevity) is a validated model using a brief multimedia culturally tailored intervention designed to teach minority children key dementia signs and symptoms, and actions taken when dementia is recognized, which is early clinical evaluation by a physician. Twenty schools (with 3000 total students) will be randomly assigned to either the OSHH intervention arm or attentional control. This program will test the hypotheses that the program will lead to significant improvement of dementia knowledge in parents, and that gains are influenced by child knowledge, the degree of child-parent communication about the topic, and socioeconomic status. The program is additionally designed to create a novel, brief “dementia action test” to fulfill a critical missing tool for efficiently assessing dementia recognition and behavioral response. This project offers a unique opportunity effectively improve multigenerational community dementia knowledge in an era increasingly moving toward time-dependent multimodal disease modifying therapy. Our group's innovative model, pilot data, and recently completed and randomized controlled trial of a similar program in stroke support our approach and collective skill sets and experience providing an unparalleled opportunity to both meet project goals and establish several key steps to meaningfully impact dementia health literacy and potentially health outcomes including early access to care.",Old SCHOOL Hip Hop: A randomized controlled trial to improve dementia knowledge,9928858,R01AG054536,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly

"Alzheimer's Disease administrative supplement for NIH grant Novel mechanism controlling calcium signaling to treat and prevent neurodegeneration in early stage glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The present administrative supplement application responds to NOT-AG-20-008, “Alzheimer's- focused administrative supplements for NIH grants that are not focused on Alzheimer's disease”. Under the parent grant for the present administrative supplement, R01 grant 1R01EY030747-01, entitled “Novel pro-drug pharmacotherapy to prevent neuronal and cell degeneration in AMD”, we are targeting a novel signaling pathway for the development of a novel pharmacological intervention to control degeneration of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and nerve cells in the retina due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. Specifically, we plan to develop a new therapeutic strategy in the multidisciplinary research project of the parent award using established models of human AMD, a novel chemical antioxidant strategy to protect RPE cells and neurons from apoptosis. The research proposed in the present administrative supplement application will allow us to build on these novel preclinical data sets and thereby to develop the novel therapeutic strategy for neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that similar to RPE cells and retinal neurons affected by AMD, oxidative stress resulting from AD pathology reducing viability and function of CNS neurons can be attenuated by the novel therapeutic strategy under development in the parent award. To this end, a novel intervention approach will be developed that can be exploited to devise novel treatments that can be delivered to CNS neurons affected by AD protecting them from oxidative stress mediated damage and loss of function. Three- dimensional (3D) bio-printed human neural cell constructs will be used as in vitro models for AD and for drug discovery in AD and related dementias employing experimental strategies aligned with the parent award. The proposed experiments will determine the potential of the targeted novel therapeutic strategy for neuroprotective and anti-oxidant therapies in AD. The innovative strategy has the potential to generate a first-in-class pharmacotherapy approach for AD. The strategy's potentially high impact lies in its capacity to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature and to complement current and future treatment designs and rationales. Project Narrative The parent grant for the present administrative supplement, determines the potential of new chemical compounds to produce a therapy approach to treat cells of the retina that were damaged due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). As the retina and the brain share the same pathways that enable this therapy approach and nerve cells affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD) display similar damage and loss of function as cells of the retina affected by AMD, translating the drug development approach of the parent grant to AD has the potential to result in novel preventative and therapeutic approaches for AD. As AD affects significant and increasing portions of the U.S. population including minorities affected by disparities in health care delivery, determining causes, mechanisms of action and subsequently potential treatment strategies, as proposed here, will contribute to improving health care, health and performance requiring cognitive and memory tasks.",Alzheimer's Disease administrative supplement

"Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center ABSTRACT - OVERVIEW The overall goal of the proposed renewal of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (Rush ADCC) is to continue to support the performance of cutting edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of MCI, AD, and other common dementias, by providing researchers with a stimulating multi-disciplinary environment, and unique and highly valued clinical and post-mortem data, and ante- and post-mortem biologic specimens. The Rush ADCC has been in continuous operation since 1991. It has eight Cores carefully designed to support a variety of timely and important areas of research including studies: 1) of the transition from normal aging to MCI and to the earliest stages of dementia with substantial participation by racial and ethnic minorities, 2) linking risk factors to normal aging, incident MCI and incident AD, and to post-mortem indices of AD and mixed pathologies, 3) that incorporate contemporary high throughput biochemical and molecular data into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, and 4) that link neuroimaging and biofluid biomarkers to contemporary biochemical and molecular data, 5) that support drug discovery pipelines, and 6) that support studies of impaired motor function. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADCC as a whole. The Clinical Core will collect UDS and additional data on Blacks without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Religious Orders Study (ROS) Core will follow older members of Catholic religious communities who have agreed to annual evaluation and brain donation at death. The Latino Core will collect the same data as in ROS on older Latinos without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Neuropathology Core will process, store, evaluate and distribute biospecimens obtained by the Clinical, ROS, and Latino Cores. The Outreach and Recruitment Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities into the Clinical and Latino Cores, and other NIA funded initiatives. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to provide the infrastructure that allows all other Cores to be maximally successful and impactful, and will provide statistical support to users of ADCC resources especially junior investigators and trainees. The new Research and Education Component will provide a structured program of mentorship across the ADCC, Rush University of the Rush ADCC strategic partners. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERVIEW The prevention of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia is a major public health priority.

"Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans Although African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss— with double the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to white Americans—we do not sufficiently understand the causes of this health disparity, nor how to best focus future interventional efforts to remediate this health crisis among older African Americans. Stress, sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyles, poor cardiovascular fitness, depressive symptoms, high body mass, and low education are all known risk factors for cognitive decline and AD; their widespread presence among African Americans, particularly in low socioeconomic communities, suggests that some or all of these may be key to the high rates of dementia and Alzheimer's among African Americans. However, little is known about the relative importance (and interactions) among these different risk factors for AD in African Americans. Additionally, there is a dearth of data on the neural changes that occur across the lifespan in older African Americans-- especially those at highest risk for AD-- and how these relate to behavioral and lifestyle risk factors for AD.  This revised R01 resubmission—including four months of pilot data from our R56 bridge award and retitled “Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans”—will address the aforementioned gaps in understanding minority health disparities in Alzheimer's disease. We will test 360 African Americans, ages 65-85, on a battery of neuropsychological, cognitive, health, fitness, genetic, and lifestyle assessments. Our sample includes 240 newly recruited participants as well as 120 legacy participants recruited during the current R56 grant. Half (180) will receive brain imaging using MRI, addressing the paucity of available neuroimaging data on older African Americans. Two aspects of our plans are especially innovative and significant to project success.  First, we address barriers to African-American research participation and retention through our ten-year history of partnership, cooperation, and trust with the African-American communities of Greater Newark through Rutgers University-Newark's African American Brain Health Initiative: A University-Community Partnership (www.brainhealth.rutgers.edu). Our long-term relationships with community-based organizations have been critical to our past successes and involve year-round programs for community outreach, education, and engagement that bolster our research recruitment and retention. Many of these efforts are funded through a five-year grant to the PI from the NJ Department of Health's Office of Minority and Multicultural Health.  Second, we address the need for evaluating and validating novel cognitive assessments that are sensitive to the earliest stages of prodromal Alzheimer's disease by having all participants complete the Rutgers Generalization Tasks, innovative cognitive assessments developed by the Co-I (Myers) and PI (Gluck). These tasks are derived from prior neurocomputational models of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus, brain regions disrupted in the earliest stages of prodromal AD. As these tasks are based on non-verbal animal conditioning paradigms, they may be especially valuable for tracking cognitive changes in our population, which is affected by low levels of education or verbal fluency. We hypothesize that deficits in generalization—the ability to apply previously learned rules to novel task demands and new stimuli—will correlate with, and longitudinally predict, cognitive decline and neural changes in prodromal AD. Aim #1. CROSS-SECTIONAL BEHAVIORAL ANALYSES: We will evaluate (1) how variations in health, physical fitness and activity are correlated with cognitive function, and (2) how the influence of these variables is mediated by education, social support, and genetics, in modulating the risk of cognitive decline and AD in elderly African Americans.!Predictions: Low levels of physical activity and cardiovascular fitness and high body mass, will be correlated with poorer performance on the Rutgers Generalization Tasks. Aim #2. NEURAL MECHANISM ANALYSES: Using multimodal MRI to capture brain structure, function, and  white matter integrity, we evaluate how the relationships in Aim #1 are mediated by neural mechanisms.  Predictions: Poorer generalization performance (and low levels of physical activity and fitness) will be associated with reduced hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortical thickness, intra-hippocampal and EC- hippocampal connectivity, and decreased FA and increased MD in the hippocampus and EC. Aim #3. LONGITUDINAL PREDICTIVE ANALYSES: To identify longitudinal aspects of the relationships  described in Aim #1 and Aim #2, along with predictors of future cognitive decline and progression to aMCI  and AD, we will test all participants at baseline and every two years thereafter (providing us data from three  time-points for the legacy R56 cohort, and two time-points for the newly recruited participants).  Predictions: Participants who progress to aMCI or AD will show early impairments on the generalization  tasks (correlated with neurodegeneration) prior to deficits in standardized memory assessments, as well as  being more likely to have a history of lower physical activity and poorer cardiovascular fitness. The proposed R01, building on our ongoing R56 data collection, will overcome current limitations to understanding the high rate of cognitive decline and AD in older African Americans, while providing further clinical and neuroimaging validation of innovative cognitive assessments, the Rutgers Generalization Tasks, which may prove useful for detecting and measuring cognitive changes in early prodromal AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE With this resubmission of R01 AG053961-01, now retitled “Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans,” the African-American Brain Health Initiative (AABHI) at Rutgers University-Newark seeks to investigate (1) the relative contributions of different modifiable health and lifestyle factors to age-related cognitive decline in African Americans, (2) the neural processes mediating these contributions, and, (3) identify early predictors of cognitive decline and conversion to aMCI and AD, and understand how the health and lifestyle behaviors influence risk for subsequent cognitive decline. Although African Americans are at elevated risk for age-related cognitive decline and memory loss—with double the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to white Americans—we do not sufficiently understand the causes of this health disparity, nor how to best focus future interventional efforts to remediate this health crisis among older African Americans. Stress, sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyles, poor cardiovascular fitness, depressive symptoms, high body mass, and low education are all known risk factors for cognitive decline and AD; their widespread presence among African Americans, particularly in low socioeconomic communities, suggests that some or all of these may be key to the high rates of dementia and Alzheimer's among African Americans. However, little is known about the relative importance (and interactions) among these different risk factors for AD in African Americans. Additionally, there is a dearth of data on the neural changes that occur across the lifespan in older African Americans-- especially those at highest risk for AD-- and how these relate to behavioral and lifestyle risk factors for AD. Our study attempts to resolve this issue by examining the cognitive, neural, and lifestyle factors associated with cognitive resilience and, conversely, those that predict early cognitive decline in older African Americans.",Risk Factors for Future Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in Older African Americans,9898203,R01AG053961,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Memory ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Physical Fitness ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' deficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' sleep debt ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep loss ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' base ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physical activity ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Stimulus ', ' Trust ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Genetic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Bridging Award ', ' Howard Temin Award ', ' Cognitive ', ' life-style factor ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' Minority ', ' conditioning ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' community partnership ', ' brain health ', ' recruit ', ' cardiovascular fitness ', ' prodromal AD ', "" prodromal Alzheimer's "", "" prodromal Alzheimer's disease "", ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' ']",NIA,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R01,2020,665008,0.18855501389307366
"Racial Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias:  The Role of Blood Pressure Throughout Adulthood PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health burden and disproportionately affect African Americans. The mechanisms underlying this disparity are not well-understood, but elevated blood pressure could be key. Compared with whites, African Americans have higher prevalence, earlier age of onset, and greater severity of hypertension. Thus, older African Americans tend to have greater cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure throughout adulthood than older whites. No prior research, however, has quantified the contribution of hypertension to racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. There are significant methodological challenges to addressing this important question, including (1) measurement of cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure from the age of onset of hypertension through late adulthood, (2) measurement of cognitive function in diverse populations, and (3) possible survival bias, which is likely to differentially affect African Americans. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify the extent to which elevated blood pressure from mid- through late- adulthood mediates racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This project uses an innovative approach to examine this important question with existing data from two diverse Northern California cohorts: the University of California, Davis Aging Diversity Cohort and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Multiphasic Health Checkup cohort, which links mid-adulthood physical examinations with long-term medical record information. Analyses will address the three major methodologic challenges outlined above by examining cumulative exposure to elevated blood pressure as measured at multiple points in adulthood, developing a novel neuroimaging-based brain health index in a diverse population, and quantifying the potential magnitude of survival bias using comprehensive midlife data to account for differential survival. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) measuring and modeling cognitive function in diverse populations, (2) clinical assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, (3) assessing brain health with neuroimaging, and (4) the biology of vascular disease relevant to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career focused on identifying modifiable determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in diverse populations. The methodological challenges addressed in this project are common to many areas of research on disparities in aging and cumulative exposure to risk factors throughout the lifecourse for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health problem and disproportionally affect African American older adults. Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias have been identified as a national priority by the National Alzheimer’s Project Act.

"Social-biological dimensions of ADRD risk and resilience in a Native American cohort PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This expansion of the Stress and Resilience in Dementia (STRIDE) study explores modifiable social-biological pathways associated with cognitive and brain-based Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) markers in a cohort of middle-aged and older members of a Midwestern tribal community. Incidence and prevalence of ADRD are rising across sociodemographic strata, but social disadvantage exacerbates risk and strong evidence suggests that African Americans and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations bear particularly high ADRD burden. Social and racial disparities in cognitive aging are clearly multifactorial but are currently underexplained. Intersecting disadvantage markers including race, geography, and socioeconomic status correlate with chronic exposure to stressors that can provoke neuroendocrine and vascular dysfunction and the premature onset of morbidity and age-related declines. However, AI/AN communities remain severely underrepresented in cognitive aging research, and “weathering” processes that plausibly link socioenvironmental adversity to ADRD-associated brain and cognitive changes have not been explored. Social resources that promote resilience are also unknown. The long-term goal of this STRIDE project is to elucidate mechanisms by which social disadvantage contributes to ADRD risk in an underserved AI/AN community, and to pinpoint community-specific individual, social, and structural resources that mitigate that risk. The short-term objective of this pilot study is to identify social and biological factors associated with ADRD markers in a cohort of AI/AN community members, and establish preliminary methods and data that will facilitate future resilience-focused research. STRIDE builds on a partnership between the tribal Commission on Aging and the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), and leverages rich existing cognitive and biomarker data available through the ADRC. The collection of multidimensional stress data including both self-reported burden and a validated index of physiological weathering allow for preliminarily modeling the influence of life-spanning stressors and resources on population-relevant ADRD markers. Aim 1: In a group of 80 AI/AN participants, examine relationships between social/physiological stress indices and markers of ADRD risk including (i) cognitive decline and (ii) in sub-set of AI/AN participants, key ADRD biomarkers such as β-amyloid42. Aim 2 (Exploratory): Characterize self-reported social resources salient to AI/AN populations and examine (i) relationships with ADRD markers and (ii) modification of relationships in Aim 1 by relevant resources. Impact: Achieving STRIDE pilot aims will establish methods and early data on community-specific social determinants of cognitive health, and identify stress-linked biological mediators that can serve as proximal outcomes in future risk reduction studies.  In so doing, STRIDE contributes to a growing body of research that seeks to recognize, understand, and reduce the growing ADRD crisis facing AI/AN communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it explores modifiable mechanisms contributing to dementia risk in American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), who are disproportionately impacted by the disease. The project integrates social and physiological data that are salient for a large Midwestern tribe with comprehensive cognitive and biomarker characterization to map novel pathways linking life-spanning social contexts to cognitive aging processes. Our long-term goal is to pinpoint social and structural resources that can mitigate socially-rooted dementia burden in AI/AN communities – the short-term objective is to establish preliminary methods, measures, and data that further that goal.",Social-biological dimensions of ADRD risk and resilience in a Native American cohort,9902304,R03AG063303,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Morbidity -

"National Social Life and Aging Project:  Wave 4 The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study which extends our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. The project is unique among nationally representative studies of older adults in the breadth and detail of health data collected, incorporating physical, psychological, sensory, functional, cognitive and social measures. In particular, we have unparalleled longitudinal measures of changes in the structure of social networks and relationships of respondents and their partners throughout the study as well as information on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). We propose to conduct in-home interviews in 2020–21 (Wave 4 [W4]) with all surviving respondents and their spouses/partners from the first three waves (W1-W3), providing 15 years of follow-up and four waves of data on this important cohort (aged 72-100 at W4). For innovations introduced in W2— a multi-domain measure of cognition (the MoCA-SA), detailed olfactory assessment, complete data from spouses/partners, an accelerometry study of sleep and daily activity, and more comprehensive measures in all domains—W4 will provide a third data point needed to model changes in health, associations, and causal relationships between them. We will enhance the data with new measures of cognition, including item response times, proxy reports, and diagnosis of ADRDs; linking to administrative data files, such as Medicare; and objectively measuring, concurrently, all five classic senses. As one example, W4 will allow the testing of key hypotheses regarding cognitive changes from normal function through dementia, providing important insights into Alzheimer's disease.  With these data, we aim to extend our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. Additionally, we will develop a framework for enrolling the oldest NSHAP subjects into internal and external investigator initiated studies addressing novel social, behavioral, and clinical questions (such as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and related dementias) in representative samples of this historically understudied population. With its rich and novel measures of social networks and of the biological, physical and psychological components of health—all measured longitudinally from both partners in a couple—NSHAP is uniquely poised to bridge the gap between large, epidemiological studies of social relationships and health and experimental studies of the mechanisms involved. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a longitudinal study which extends our understanding of the mechanisms through which the trajectories of social connectivity and health are intertwined in an aging population. In 2020-21, NSHAP W4 will collect information on the health and wellbeing of Americans ages 72 to 100 and their partners.

"Neurovascular and metabolic sex differences in contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia including Alzheimer's disease Project summary  Fifty million people worldwide are living with dementia and a new case of dementia is diagnosed every 3 seconds. Dementia is a major cause of disability among older people and it has a profound health and economic impact, not only on people with dementia, but also on their caregivers, families and the larger society. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the main dementia afflicting 5.8 million Americans and nearly two-thirds (3.6 million) are women. Long-held view for the cause of this disparity pointed at the greater female life-span. However recent emerging evidence shows that the lifetime risk, incidence and severity of cognitive impairment and dementia are much higher among older women than in older men. This positions aging and female gender as two of the major risk factors for sporadic AD, particularly after menopause, but the biological basis of the sex-based distinctions in dementia onset and progression remain elusive. In a significant portion of the human studies the gender is regressed out and the data is pooled together to increase the effect size. Until recently, the bulk of the animal studies used only males in effort to keep the cost low by reducing the experimental groups. As a direct consequence, even though metabolic and vascular dysfunctions are now accepted to be major contributors to cognitive impairment and dementia, the sex differences for this influence are largely unknown.  The goal of this project is to deliver an integrative view on sex differences in dynamic neurovascular coupling and real time neuroenergetics in rodent dementia models, particularly AD. Our central hypothesis is that vascular and metabolic dysfunctions in cognitive impairment and dementia interact with neuroendocrine regulators to drive pathology in a sex-specific manner. Our approach combines in vivo multimodal vascular and metabolic brain imaging with single cell transcriptomics to relate functional aspects of neurovascular resilience to specific cell types and uncover personalized molecular targets for therapy. We conjecture that both males and females with dementia experience decline in vascular and metabolic function that contributes to the disease etiology, however the severity, mechanism and timeline between the sexes is different. Our preliminary data in AD models shows that both sexes have decline in cerebral blood flow during the disease onset with female mice having more severe reductions and specific patters. We will measure the concomitant drop in tissue oxygenation where the with sex differences is still unclear and look for changes of glycolytic rates in the brain. We will correlate an array of vascular and metabolic measures with well described hallmarks of AD such as vascular and tissue amyloid plaques. At time points where we can observe the highest functional changes, we will use single-cell transcriptomics to look which cell types drive the neuroenergetic shifts. We aim to elucidate how the particular gene clusters sorted by the function of their protein products relate to the functional vascular and metabolic events we observe. Finally, in a prove-of-concept effort we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of pharmacogenetic and optogenetic modulation of neurons in the hypothalamus that play role in late life neurogenic hypertension.  The investigation into sex differences and symptom modulation of neurodegeneration is in its infancy. Identifying the mechanisms underlying sex differences in etiology, onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease will provide valuable insights leading to tailored therapeutics that will benefit all humans. Project narrative  The objective is to uncover and probe the mechanistic pathways behind the sex differences in vascular and metabolic contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. Then highlight those differences and develop reasonable diagnostic and treatment strategies that are readily translatable in humans. The proposed research is relevant to human health because its results will benefit both sexes and in a long run will improve categorically the patient preventive, diagnostic and treatment care. It will allow earlier diagnosis of cognitive decline and dementia on a sex-specific timeline, it will improve personalized medicine and provide more accurate biomarkers for treatment

"Resilience Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease The overall aim of this longitudinal study is to identify new, modifiable mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) among a multi-ethnic cohort of approximately 2,000 older adults. The incidence of AD is higher for African Americans and Hispanics, compared to non-Hispanic Whites, even after controlling for the “usual suspects” in disparities research: traditional socioeconomic indicators and vascular health. Persistent and unexplained disparities suggest two possibilities that have not been well-examined: (1) known AD risk factors exhibit differential impact across race/ethnicity and/or (2) yet unmeasured factors increase AD risk for minorities. Our research team has identified multiple factors that have stronger cognitive impact among older African Americans or Hispanics, including depressive symptoms and MRI markers of brain pathology. These variables, along with poor vascular health and lower education/income, may be less impactful among Whites because membership in a majority group is associated with social-environmental resources that promote resilience. In the current proposal, resilience is conceptualized as better-than-expected outcomes given level of AD risk factors or brain pathology. This study will examine how resources that differ across race/ethnicity in our cohort (e.g., perceived social status, quality of education, and the perception that life outcomes are controllable) promote resilience at multiple points in the AD pathogenic pathway using repeat MRI and cognitive assessments across three time points. Because racial/ethnic minorities face unique stressors (e.g., acculturative stress, racial discrimination), we will also test whether these experiences influence the progression of MRI markers of brain pathology, cognitive decline, and incident AD. Our overarching hypothesis is that AD disparities persist because racial/ethnic minorities have depleted resources to adapt to known AD risk factors and brain pathology and/or unique, yet unmeasured AD risk factors. Specific aims are to (1) identify risk factors relevant to minority populations and examine whether they predict advancing brain pathology, cognitive decline, and incident AD among African Americans or Hispanics, (2) determine which resources explain racial/ethnic differences in the impact of known AD risk factors on advancing brain pathology (i.e., brain resilience), and (3) determine which resources explain racial/ethnic differences in the impact of advancing brain pathology on cognitive decline and incident AD (i.e., cognitive resilience). The prevalence of AD and the societal burden associated with AD treatment and care are on the rise because the U.S. population is aging. The proportion of U.S. elders who are African American or Hispanic is also increasing. These groups are at higher risk for AD than similarly aged non-Hispanic Whites, even after traditional socioeconomic indicators and cardiovascular health are taken into account. It is therefore critical to identify other, modifiable factors that reduce AD risk and eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in AD.",Resilience Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease,9953938,R01AG054520,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social position ', ' social standing ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' regional atrophy ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1073571,0.1744195925757889
"Factors of Resilience to Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias among Latinx: The Role of Bilingualism Project Summary/Abstract As the population ages, Latinx communities, families, and healthcare systems will be confronted by the growing crisis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Identifying factors that confer resilience to ADRD among aging Latinx communities is of critical importance to successfully reduce disparities. Some studies find that bilinguals are at reduced AD risk compared to monolinguals, but other studies do not find evidence of a bilingual advantage. Little attention has been given to within-group differences among bilinguals, such as age of second language (L2) acquisition, proficiency, and frequency of language use, and how these differences 1) are related to cognitive function in older age, 2) if they buffer the effects of neuropathology on cognitive decline, and 3) how cognitive decline in AD can influence language use among bilinguals. Determination of the aspects of bilingualism that confer resilience to AD could lead to novel interventions to mitigate cognitive aging and ADRD disparities. The overall aim of this proposed research is to determine whether aspects of bilingualism, including age of acquisition, language use, and proficiency, buffer the effects of neuroimaging markers of pathology (i.e., AD biomarkers and cerebrovascular disease) on cognition and cognitive decline within middle- and older-aged Latinx adults. The central hypothesis is that early age of L2 acquisition, greater daily use of both L1 and L2, and greater L2 proficiency will confer cognitive reserve, independent of confounding sociocultural factors (i.e., education, socioeconomic status, immigration). Aims 1a and 1b (K99) focus on identifying which aspects of bilingualism are associated with cognition and which moderate the relationship between imaging markers and cognition. Aims 2a and 2b (R00) proposes to determine the relationship between bilingualism and imaging markers on cognitive decline and determine whether change in cognitive status is associated with changes in bilingualism. The proposed study will harmonize data from Latinx adults currently enrolled in three longitudinal cohorts with available amyloid and tau PET, MRI, and cognitive assessments: the Offspring study and the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project at Columbia University, and the University of California-Davis Diversity Aging Cohort. To accomplish these goals, the applicant will build on his strengths in cultural neuropsychology, health disparities, and statistical methods by obtaining training during the K99 phase on 1) expanding knowledge of the cognitive neuroscience and psycholinguistics of bilingualism; 2) modeling neuroimaging data; 3) the operationalization and measurement of resilience among aging Latinx populations; and 4) enhancing statistical methods focused on data harmonization, casual inference methods and latent variable modeling. This K99/R00 proposal lays the foundation for an independent research career focused on mechanisms underlying the protective factors of bilingualism and biculturalism in cognitive aging in a diverse population. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Latinx are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared with non- Hispanic whites. Bilingualism may reduce ADRD risk but prior studies lack detailed characterization of within- group differences among bilinguals such as age of second language (L2) acquisition, L2 proficiency, and frequency of dual language use and its relationship to cognition in the presence of neuropathology. The current study will elucidate mechanisms underlying the relationship among bilingualism, neuroimaging markers of pathology, and cognitive function, which has the potential to inform novel interventions to preserve cognitive function and reduce ADRD disparities.",Factors of Resilience to Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias among Latinx: The Role of

"Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment among Mexican Americans PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this research is to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI): (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early detection and treatment. AD is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia and the 5th leading cause of death for those over 65 (8th leading cause of death for U.S. Hispanics). AD has an annual health care cost that is greater than that of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. While death rates from CVD and cancer have declined in recent decades, death rates have steadily increased for AD. The Mexican American elderly population is among the fastest growing segments of the population; however, little research on MCI and AD has been conducted among this underserved group. Here we will leverage our ongoing Health & Aging Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE) study to identify different pathways for MCI and AD among Mexican Americans, define subtle neuroanatomical and blood-based biomarker changes that are related to future risk of MCI and AD as well as provide evidence to support the utility of our AD blood-based detection tool that can be implemented in primary care settings. The current research team consists of leading experts in Mexican American cognitive aging, the epidemiology of MCI and AD as well as biomarkers of MCI and AD (neuroimaging and blood-based). The project will leverage a substantial existing infrastructure and HABLE cohort to address the two health disparities outlined above through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 - Examine the impact of higher rates of metabolic burden and depressive symptomatology on MCI and AD among community-dwelling Mexican Americans; Specific Aim 2 - Examine neuroimaging and blood-based biomarkers associated with MCI and AD among Mexican Americans; and Specific Aim 3: Validate our blood-based AD screening tool as the first-step in a multi-stage diagnostic process among Mexican Americans. The current project will address significant health disparities faced by Mexican American elders suffering from and at risk for MCI and AD. The identification of novel pathways related to disproportionate burden of diabetes and depression can lead to novel ethnic-specific interventions. The identification of a blood-based screening tool for AD will provide primary care providers a way of meeting the needs of a rapidly growing elderly Mexican American population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly growing number of patients suffering from Alzheimer's (AD), little work has been conducted on AD among Mexican Americans. Here we propose to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from AD (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early diagnosis methods. The relevance of this project is the identification of potentially different pathways to AD among Mexican Americans (directly related to increased rates of diabetes and depression and the health disparity of earlier age of onset) as well as the provision of a blood-based screening tool for AD that can be implemented in primary care clinics.",Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild

"Lifestyle Behaviors and Racial Differences in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: One in ten Americans age 65 and older are currently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Although Alzheimer’s disease was identified more than 100 years ago, racial disparities in the disease continue to persist. Research has consistently indicated that among all racial groups, African Americans have the highest Alzheimer’s disease risk, which is nearly twice as high compared to White older adults. Despite the wide scientific evidence for this disparity, the reasons for these racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease risk remain unclear. Prior research indicates that lifestyle behaviors are associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. Further, African Americans have been noted to have a higher prevalence of poor lifestyle behaviors associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as physical inactivity and cigarette smoking. While numerous studies have explored how lifestyle behaviors are associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk, there has been no research that has examined whether lifestyle behaviors contribute to racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease. This proposed study explores engagement in three particular lifestyle behaviors: physical activity, cigarette smoking, and social contacts. With this in consideration, the central objective of this study is to investigate the influence of lifestyle behaviors on the differential risk for Alzheimer’s disease/dementia between White and African American older adults. To better understand this relationship, this study has three aims: 1) To determine the influence of lifestyle behaviors on Alzheimer’s disease/dementia risk among older adults, 2) To determine how lifestyle behaviors influence racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease/dementia risk between White and African American older adults, and 3) To determine how race moderates the relationship between lifestyle behaviors and Alzheimer’s disease/dementia risk among older adults. METHODS: This study will use secondary data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a longitudinal panel study that surveys a nationally representative sample of more than 12,000 older adults age 65 and older within the United States. All available NHATS data from 2011 to 2016 will be used for this study. The dependent variable is age of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia diagnosis. The primary independent variables are individual and cumulative engagement in physical activity, smoking, and social contacts. Each aim will be analyzed with Cox proportional hazard models, while controlling for sociodemographics and health. IMPLICATIONS: Findings from this study will offer major implications for public health by providing insight into how certain lifestyle behaviors can influence the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Further, findings from this study may reveal whether lifestyle behaviors contribute to racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease, which may be crucial in addressing racial disparities by indicating which lifestyle behaviors may be especially protective in reducing Alzheimer’s disease risk among African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide insight into how lifestyle behaviors can influence Alzheimer’s disease risk, which could be used by health care professionals to provide targeted interventions for individuals already at a high risk for Alzheimer’s disease due to pre-existing risk factors such as genetics and co-morbidities. Findings may also reveal whether lifestyle behaviors contribute to racial differences in Alzheimer’s disease, which may be crucial in addressing racial disparities by indicating which lifestyle behaviors may be especially protective in reducing Alzheimer’s disease risk among African Americans. Further, findings from this study may encourage public health professionals and policymakers to collaborate and develop Alzheimer’s disease prevention strategies by promoting engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors in daily life, which is important given that there remains no definitive cure or treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.",Lifestyle Behaviors and Racial Differences in Alzheimer's Disease,9870862,R36AG061426,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Smoker ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' American ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' trend ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' AD prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' high risk ', ' nongenetic ', ' non-genetic ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' social engagement ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R36,2020,53001,0.060617560764061704
"Rush Alzheimer's Disease Core Center ABSTRACT - OVERVIEW The overall goal of the proposed renewal of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center (Rush ADCC) is to continue to support the performance of cutting edge and innovative research on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of MCI, AD, and other common dementias, by providing researchers with a stimulating multi-disciplinary environment, and unique and highly valued clinical and post-mortem data, and ante- and post-mortem biologic specimens. The Rush ADCC has been in continuous operation since 1991. It has eight Cores carefully designed to support a variety of timely and important areas of research including studies: 1) of the transition from normal aging to MCI and to the earliest stages of dementia with substantial participation by racial and ethnic minorities, 2) linking risk factors to normal aging, incident MCI and incident AD, and to post-mortem indices of AD and mixed pathologies, 3) that incorporate contemporary high throughput biochemical and molecular data into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, and 4) that link neuroimaging and biofluid biomarkers to contemporary biochemical and molecular data, 5) that support drug discovery pipelines, and 6) that support studies of impaired motor function. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADCC as a whole. The Clinical Core will collect UDS and additional data on Blacks without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Religious Orders Study (ROS) Core will follow older members of Catholic religious communities who have agreed to annual evaluation and brain donation at death. The Latino Core will collect the same data as in ROS on older Latinos without dementia and work to obtain brain autopsy. The Neuropathology Core will process, store, evaluate and distribute biospecimens obtained by the Clinical, ROS, and Latino Cores. The Outreach and Recruitment Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities into the Clinical and Latino Cores, and other NIA funded initiatives. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to provide the infrastructure that allows all other Cores to be maximally successful and impactful, and will provide statistical support to users of ADCC resources especially junior investigators and trainees. The new Research and Education Component will provide a structured program of mentorship across the ADCC, Rush University of the Rush ADCC strategic partners. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERVIEW The prevention of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia is a major public health priority.

"Human vs. Rodent Amyloid-beta Fibrils We propose to compare the structures of human and rodent (mouse and naked mole rat) amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils using solid-state NMR. Transgenic mouse models are a mainstay of Alzheimer’s disease research. Many of these models include overexpression of Aβ, with various mixtures of human and endogenous mouse peptides in the different models. Although a great deal has been learned about the structure of human Aβ fibrils, much less is known about mouse Aβ, and species differences between rodent and human Aβ aggregates is underappreciated. This difference, however, could bear importantly on studies of neurotoxicity of Aβ. Some transgenic mouse models include massive overexpression of Aβ, and while this leads to some cognitive impairment, the burden of amyloid deposition seems disproportionately great compared to the neurological findings. There are several possible, non-mutually exclusive explanations for this discrepancy. Here, we propose to study one of them: that mouse and rodent Aβ aggregates differ structurally. It has been amply demonstrated that human Aβ peptides display polymorphism: that is, a single polypeptide can form different fibril structures depending on fibrillization conditions. These polymorphs differ in cyto-/neurotoxicity. Thus, this proposal is guided by the hypothesis that structural differences in mouse and human Aβ aggregates could lead to differences in neurological effects. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we will compare human and rodent Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils. The proposal has two Specific Aims. The first is to compare the structures of Aβ fibrils from mouse, naked mole rat and human peptides using SS-NMR. These peptides differ at several key residues in the N- terminal domain of Aβ. Preliminary data (TEM, NMR) indicate that fibrils from these 3 species (rationale for these choices is given in the proposal), formed under rigorous controlled, identical conditions, adopt different structures. Aim 1 will continue these investigations. The second specific aim is to study and compare the structures of mouse and human brain-seeded Aβ fibrils. We have published several papers on producing “replicate fibrils” for solid-state NMR, by seeding with authentic human brain amyloid from patients who died with Alzheimer's disease. We now propose to apply these methods to compare human and mouse brain amyloid-seeded Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils. Future plans are 1) to extend this work, in an R01 application, to a comparison of the cyto-/neurotoxicity of polymorphs directly; and 2) an application of these seeding techniques to examine brain amyloid-seeded soluble oligomers of Aβ peptides. This is a proposal to compare human and rodent (mouse and naked mole rat) Aβ40 and Aβ42 (amyloid-β) fibrils using solid-state NMR. Despite the widespread use of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, with overexpression Aβ, relatively little is known about the structure rodent Aβ fibrils, and how these differences might relate to neurotoxicity. We will compare polymorphism of human and rodent Aβ fibrils using expressed peptide and brain amyloid-seeded fibrils, and in future work, relate structural differences to possible differences in cytotoxicity.",Human vs. Rodent Amyloid-beta Fibrils,9955764,R21AG067036,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Future ', ' Gangliosides ', ' Sialoglycosphingolipids ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' cross-link ', ' crosslink ', ' species difference ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Inequality ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nervous System Finding ', ' Neurologic Finding ', ' Neurological observations ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' Molerats ', ' Mole Rats ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' divalent metal ', ' Transmission Electron Microscopy ', ' Structure ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' polypeptide ', ' Address ', ' Amyloid Fibrils ', ' cytotoxic ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Neurologic Effect ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' N-terminal ', ' Impairment ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' Amyloid β oligomer ', ' amyloid beta oligomer ', ' aβ oligomer ', ' abeta oligomer ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' AD model ', ' alzheimer model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' amyloid structure ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' SSNMR ', ' solid state NMR ', ' solid state nuclear magnetic resonance ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' Polymorph ', ' A β-42 ', ' A β42 ', ' A-beta 42 ', ' A-beta42 ', ' Abeta-42 ', ' Abeta42 ', ' Amyloid beta42 ', ' Amyloid β-42 ', ' Amyloid β42 ', ' Amyloidβ-42 ', ' Amyloidβ42 ', ' Aβ-42 ', ' Aβ42 ', ' Amyloid beta-42 ', ' Aβ burden ', ' a-beta burden ', ' abeta burden ', ' amyloid burden ', ' beta amyloid burden ', ' βamyloid burden ', ' β-amyloid burden ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2020,445500,0.06845548278629582
"Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Ethnic Factors: The Case of Arab Americans Alzheimer’s Disease Risk and Ethnic Factors: The Case of Arab Americans Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afflicts 11% of the U.S. population aged 65 and over, and half of these cases go undiagnosed. The incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD is higher among many racial/ ethnic minorities, but rates among Arab Americans, who possess more cardiovascular risk factors than whites, are unknown. The first of its kind, this study will collect regionally representative data from Arab Americans (N=600) aged 65 and over living in the metro-Detroit area, home to the largest and most visible Arab American community in the U.S. Additionally, we will leverage an existing sample of black and white older adults from the Survey of Social Relations (SRS) to compare and contrast prevalence of AD and the role of structural factors among Arab Americans to other populations in the same geographic area. The planned project will form the basis of a future prospective study to advance understanding of racial/ethnic health disparities in AD incidence. The specific aims are to: 1) Characterize cognition and AD risk among Arab Americans in metro-Detroit; 2) Determine the contribution of immigrant factors to cognition and AD risk among older Arab Americans; 3) Identify aspects of social networks that have greatest effects on cognition and AD risk. This project will produce currently unavailable normative data that will assist practitioners in the assessment of AD in English and Arabic speaking Arab American elders. With a focus on AD disparities, and socio-behavioral factors, these data will provide opportunities to compare to regional and national data on other racial/ethnic minorities in the quest to quantify health disparities and identify mechanisms that cause and sustain them. In addition to delineating health disparities, studying Arab Americans can refine our understanding of immigrant health in the U.S. Further, the study of social networks among diverse racial/ethnic groups will reveal how and why social ties form and function as a protective factor (direct and buffering) on cognitive health. Understanding the role of structural and cultural factors will refine theory about AD disparities and provide key information to better develop intervention strategies for effective management of this growing and high-cost disease.

"Midlife cognitive aging in Hispanic/Latinos:  Predictors and mechanisms of decline PROJECT SUMMARY Individuals from Hispanic/Latino backgrounds have a 50% increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to non-Hispanic white individuals. With the changing demographic trends in the United States, the prevalence of AD in the Hispanic/Latino population is expected to increase nine fold over the next 50 years. In addition to the patient, the burden of AD takes a significant toll on the families of loved ones with dementia, their communities, and the healthcare system. The difference in prevalence of AD is rooted in social disparities rather than differences in genetic vulnerability between Hispanic/Latino and white populations. It is critical to identify the specific social determinants in Hispanic/Latino populations that can be leveraged to develop culturally informed interventions that aim to maintain cognitive health and slow or prevent the progression toward mild cognitive impairment and clinical dementia. Midlife is a particularly important, yet understudied, period of the lifespan for cognitive aging. Prevention and intervention efforts are likely to be more effective if started before significant neuropathology accumulates in the brain. The objective of this proposal is to identify midlife factors and associated processes that contribute to health disparities in cognitive decline and risk of dementia. We will leverage an existing longitudinal study of midlife adults – the California Families Project – to couple more than 10 years of repeated assessments across middle adulthood with new data collection on the risk/protective factors and cognitive outcomes. This project will test socioeconomic (e.g., education, financial hardship), personality (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness), social (e.g., discrimination, social support), and acculturation (e.g., cultural values, acculturative stress) risk/protective factors for cognitive functioning in midlife Hispanic/Latino adults and the behavioral (e.g., physical inactivity, smoking), psychosocial (e.g., depressive symptoms, delay discounting), and physiological (e.g., inflammation, cellular biomarkers) mechanisms that explain these associations. This work will lead to new knowledge on midlife predictors of cognition and risk of AD, identify social determinants and pathways that create and sustain health disparities for Hispanic/Latino populations, and point to new prevention and intervention targets for promoting healthy cognitive aging in midlife and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults of Latino origin have a 50% increased risk of the disease compared to non-Latino white adults, a difference due to social determinants rather than differences in genetic vulnerability.

"Psychosocial stressors and the hippocampal memory system in African American seniors PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A larger percentage of African Americans than Americans of European ancestry have Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying causes of this health disparity are not well understood. African American seniors perform worse than white seniors on a range of cognitive tests. Differences in socioeconomic and health status account for large portions of this disparity, but differences remain. Although race has no biological basis, discrimination related to racial minority status is a salient chronic psychosocial stressor in African Americans that has negative health consequences, contributing to obesity, hypertension, and other conditions. This suggests that psychosocial chronic stress due to experiences of racism may contribute to the health disparities in AD and cognition. The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that, together with the entorhinal cortex, is negatively impacted by both AD and chronic stress. Stress models have shown that the rate of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which is the generation of new neurons in the adult brain, is negatively affected by chronic stress, aging, and AD. In addition, the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex have a high concentration of glucocorticoid receptors, which are binding sites for the “stress hormone” cortisol. Another well-established modulator of adult neurogenesis is aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise and chronic stress are both potent, but opposite modulators of adult neurogenesis. Increasing physical activity is one of the most effective interventions for slowing down cognitive decline in aging and AD. The goal of this research is to examine how psycho-social chronic stress due to experiences of racism affects the hippocampal memory system (Aim 1), and to examine an association between moderate-intensity physical activity and hippocampal function and structure (Aim 2A) comparing African American seniors with those of European ancestry. We will then investigate whether cortisol, measured in saliva, mediates, i.e. explains, the association between chronic stress and brain integrity, and whether moderate-intensity physical activity and race moderate the strength of the correlation between chronic stress and integrity of the hippocampus and of cortical regions known to be affected by AD (Aim 2B). We will address these questions with high-resolution functional and structural MRI to examine brain integrity. These neuroimaging techniques have the resolution to zoom in on the dentate gyrus subfield of the hippocampus, which is the primary area where adult neurogenesis occurs, while at the same time allowing examination of cortical AD signature regions. We will leverage the availability of an African American cohort in the Health Outreach Program for the Elderly (HOPE) registry at the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center. The proposed work could generate a new hypothesis: individuals experiencing chronic psychosocial stress due to racism may show accelerated cognitive decline consistent with AD. In the future this new hypothesis could then be tested by following HOPE participants longitudinally and could examine exercise training as a modulator. Reducing the AD health disparity among racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. is a critical public health goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE A greater number of African Americans than Americans of European ancestry have Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the contributing factors are not well understood. The proposed project will examine the contributions of chronic psychosocial stress due to experiences of racial discrimination and other chronic stressors on the hippocampal memory system comparing African American seniors with those of European ancestry, and will investigate how the strength of this association may be modulated by moderate-intensity physical activity. Individuals experiencing chronic psychosocial stress due to racial minority status may show accelerated cognitive decline consistent with AD; a positive outcome of this work will suggest potential avenues for reducing the AD health disparity, which is a pressing public health concern.",Psychosocial stressors and the hippocampal memory system in African American

"Incident Vascular Brain Injury, Probable Alzheimer's Disease, and Cognitive Change in Elderly American Indians PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A workshop convened in 2013 by National Institute of Aging and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke prioritized research on cognitive impairment of multiple etiologies, contributions of vascular brain injury (VBI) to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and disparities involving race, ethnicity, socioeconomics, and rural residence. VBI is a leading cause of accelerated brain aging and a major risk factor for stroke, cognitive decline, depression, and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few studies have evaluated VBI, cognitive impairment, and AD in American Indians (AIs), who bear a heavy burden of risk factors for these conditions. This exclusion is unfortunate, since the distinctive history, risk profiles, environmental stressors, social environments, and healthcare systems of AIs likely result in patterns of disease that differ substantially from other populations. Our research team has conducted the only cohort study to date of covert VBI in AIs. In 2010-2013, Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians study completed standardized clinical examinations, neuropsychological testing, and cranial MRI on more than 1,000 AIs aged 64-95 years from 10 tribes in 3 states. In 2016, we began re-examination of surviving participants using the same protocols, augmented by assessment for probable AD. However, the particular grant mechanism from the National Institute on Aging that provides funding for this follow-up examination is limited to data collection, with no resources allocated for analysis. In this proposal, we will capitalize on the accumulated longitudinal data to apply sophisticated imaging and analysis methods to quantify and evaluate associations for incident VBI, neurodegeneration, and changes in cognitive status in this elderly minority population. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) establish normative and diagnostic standards for mild cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly AIs, and evaluate associations and determinants for incident VBI, cerebral atrophy, cognitive decline, and probable AD; (2) conduct cluster analyses to identify novel neuroimaging profiles that predict subgroups of elderly AIs at highest risk for cerebral atrophy, cognitive decline, and probable AD; and (3) complete a rigorous career development plan that will position the applicant as an independent investigator and leader in innovative neuroepidemiology research with minority populations. This proposal leverages a timely opportunity to generate the first population-based estimates of and address novel scientific questions on VBI and cognitive impairment in AIs, a minority population with pervasive health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE American Indians bear a disproportionate burden of the complications of cardiovascular risk, which may cause damage to the brain and result in cognitive impairment. In addition, little is known about other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, in this group. We will establish the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes related to new onset of these conditions, and of problems in memory, concentration, and thinking among American Indians residing across three regions of the US.","Incident Vascular Brain Injury, Probable Alzheimer's Disease, and Cognitive Change in Elderly American Indians",9894705,K01AG057821,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders

"MRI markers of brain aging and risk factors for cognitive decline in older African Americans ABSTRACT The aging research community has identified numerous risk factors associated with the full spectrum of cognition including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and there is greater understanding of the underlying brain mechanisms. Unfortunately, the vast majority of knowledge comes from studies of primarily non-Hispanic Whites. Although African Americans bear a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment, the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying these disparities remain elusive. The overall goal of the proposed study is to investigate the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms linking culturally-relevant psychosocial risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD in older African Americans. Existing literature with MRI data in older African Americans has focused almost exclusively on cross-sectional associations of cognition or incident AD, and has examined traditional risk factors. Very few studies of African Americans have examined culturally relevant risk factors with repeated measures of cognitive function and brain integrity over time to test the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms linking risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD. We propose to interrogate changes in structural and functional integrity on MRI as key neurobiologic substrates linking these socially relevant risk factors to cognitive decline and risk of AD in African Americans. Leveraging the well-established infrastructure of the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), including available data on risk factors, and repeated measures of cognitive function, we will use a multi-modal neuroimaging approach to acquire antemortem MRI scans on 400 African Americans and quantify change in a number of brain MRI indices to address the Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine the relation of change in brain MRI indices with rate of cognitive decline and risk of AD among older African Americans; Aim 2 will examine the relation of early and mid-life cultural risk factors with change in structural and functional brain MRI indices among older African Americans; Aim 3 will determine if change in brain MRI indices affects the relation of early- and mid-life risk factors to rate of decline and risk of AD among older African Americans; and taking advantage of neuroimaging and cognitive function data available at no cost from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), Aim 4 will identify racial differences in the relation of change in MRI structural and functional brain integrity to cognitive decline. Cognitive impairment associated with aging is a large and growing public health problem that disproportionately burdens African Americans. Knowledge of the neurobiologic pathways linking risk factors to cognitive decline will ultimately provide targets for future prevention/intervention studies, and will have a strong and sustained impact on the field. NARRATIVE The proposed study has great public health relevance.

"OLFACTORY IMPAIRMENT IN OFFSPRING STUDY OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE We plan to test the 12-item BSIT, a short, standardized, cross-culturally validated subset of the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), in an add-on study to the recently funded project “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease” (RF1 AG054070). Middle-aged offspring (age 40-64) of parents who participated in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) are being studied with clinical and neuropsychological evaluation (n=3,000), high-resolution structural MRI (n=1,000), and Aβ PET (n=150). In the years 2004-2010, over one-third (n=1,369) of the intensively studied parent cohort had odor identification testing with the full 40-item UPSIT.  Odor identification impairment distinguishes dementia from cognitively intact controls, predicts transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, and predicts cognitive decline in older adults without dementia better than episodic verbal memory deficits. Further, odor identification impairment has been associated with increased mortality even after controlling for dementia and medical comorbidity in older adults, and in this offspring study, mortality will become an important outcome if longitudinal follow-up is instituted eventually. In the proposed cross-sectional study, we hypothesize that in the cohort of 3,000 offspring, lower BSIT scores (impaired odor identification) will be associated with increased age and the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele, and correlate with impaired cognitive ability in Whites (increased incipient AD pathology) to a greater extent than in African Americans or Hispanics (increased incipient cerebrovascular pathology). In the 1,000 offspring that get MRI brain scans, we expect that lower BSIT scores will be associated with smaller hippocampal volume and cortical thinning in Whites but not African Americans or Hispanics. In the 150 offspring that get amyloid PET scans, lower BSIT scores are anticipated to be associated with greater amyloid uptake among Whites, but not among African Americans or Hispanics. We will also evaluate BSIT in the offspring in relation to parental BSIT performance and risk of AD in the parents. We have begun pilot work in administering the BSIT to the first 300 offspring being studied, and expect to be able to assess all study participants with the BSIT, without loss of any BSIT data, if this proposal is funded. Our overarching goal is to identify priority biological or social factors for intervention during the preclinical stage of AD, and determine whether strategies to prevent AD should differ across race/ethnicity. Adding odor identification testing furthers these goals in the existing project and allows for the testing of specific hypotheses that will enhance our understanding of the associations and potential utility of this inexpensive early biomarker of AD.   Based on the knowledge that impairment in odor identification predicts both cognitive decline and the transition from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults, we plan to test the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) in 3,000 offspring as an add-on study to the recently funded project “Offspring study of mechanisms for racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease” (RF1 AG054070). Middle-aged offspring (age 40-64) of parents who participated in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) are being studied with clinical and neuropsychological evaluation (n=3,000), high-resolution structural MRI (n=1,000), and amyloid PET imaging (n=150).

"Supplement to Recruitment Innovations to Enhance Diversity in AD Research Project Abstract Despite experiencing Alzheimer’s-related health problems at a disproportionate rate, African Americans are consistently and severely underrepresented in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) research projects. Insufficient enrollment of African Americans in this line of research is a nationally-recognized problem. This is highly concerning not only because of the need for unbiased, representative samples in basic science and clinical research, but also because involving persons from underrepresented minority groups is crucial to advancing our understanding of, and ultimately combating, health disparities. In response to PAR-15-349 “Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease”, we propose to develop and evaluate a novel strategy that uses a storytelling campaign to enhance recruitment of African American adults into research at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center. In Specific Aim 1, we will build on our promising pilot work to refine and evaluate community members’ acceptance of a storytelling strategy for communicating Alzheimer’s-related research participation experiences of African Americans in mid and late life. The storytelling strategy will highlight African Americans’ research participation narratives, as derived from a series of ethnographic interviews and told using short videos. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the effect of this storytelling strategy on recruitment of African Americans into ADRD research. Videos developed in Aim 1 will be incorporated into all existing ADRC recruitment efforts, ranging from community events to social media strategies. The primary outcome for Aim 2 will be the proportion of African Americans recruited to the ADRC Clinical Core over an 18 month period, with the preceding 18 month period serving as the comparator. Specific Aim 3 will use path analysis modeling to explore the mechanisms by which a storytelling strategy increases enrollment of African Americans into ADRD research in general, and into a specific study designed to address health disparities. Realizing the goals of this study will increase racial and ethnic diversity in ADRD research at a leading NIA-funded ADRC and ultimately, help to reduce cognitive health disparities amongst African Americans. Findings from this study will directly inform best practices for increasing diversity within the national AD Centers network, with significant implications for a range of underrepresented populations. Furthermore, these findings will also have applications in other disease contexts in which scientific progress is constrained by insufficient recruitment of persons from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups.

"Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this application, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a presidentially initiated effort to understand the genetics of AD in hopes of developing new targets for therapies. Currently lacking in these efforts, however, is the inclusion of African American (AA) populations and the generalization of research findings to AA communities. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we propose a set of experiments that will complement the activities in the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases while addressing the issue of health disparities in AA AD research.",Replication and Extension of ADSP Discoveries in African-Americans,9933766,U01AG052410,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' Pedigree ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' falls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Community Networks ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' exhaustion ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' SNP chip ', ' single nucleotide polymorphism array ', ' single nucleotide polymorphism chip ', ' SNP array ', ' admixture mapping ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' genetic architecture ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' genomic locus ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2020,1803901,0.04163752629583948
"Gene by Early Life Environment Interaction on Cognitive Decline Project Summary/Abstract  Cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s dementia greatly impact the health and quality of life of older adults, as well as their families and support systems. Prior research has identified environmental and genetic risk factors for pathological cognitive decline and described pathophysiologic processes. The Apolipoprotein (ApoE) ε4 allele is well established as the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and has also been shown to be associated with dementia, cognitive decline and progressive memory loss. Risk estimates vary widely, suggesting that other factors, potentially including both other genes and environmental exposures, could modify the effect of ApoE on cognitive outcomes. Indeed, there is evidence that genetic penetrance of ApoE variants do vary by engagement in cognitively stimulating activities in adulthood and older ages, physical activity in adulthood and older ages, and education achieved. Most studies that have considered whether socio-environmental conditions modify the effect of genetic polymorphisms on late-life cognitive outcomes have examined individual educational attainment or social and environmental measurements taken later in life as potential effect modifiers. There is less evidence as to whether early-life circumstance might modify genetic effects. This is a striking gap, as there is a substantial body of research exploring the relationship between early life circumstances and late-life health outcomes, including cognition. Further, the primary mechanism by which the ApoE ε4 allele is thought to negatively impact cognitive outcomes is via increased neuropathological burden. There is some evidence that early life cognitive ability is associated with neuropathological burden. However, other environmental measures, such as level of education, have not shown any associations with neuropathology, and instead appear to influence cognitive capacity despite accumulation of AD related neuropathologies, i.e. by creating cognitive reserve. In this study, I plan to explore whether the penetrance of genetic risk for cognitive decline varies by early life environment, operationalized as birth cohort, childhood socioeconomic status, and childhood adversity. Further, I plan to examine whether individual early life factors modify genetic effects on neuropathological damage or on cognitive function given the level of neuropathological damage (i.e. via cognitive reserve). Project Narrative This project will examine whether early life conditions modify the genetic penetrance of risk alleles associated with cognitive pathologies in old age. The findings will contribute the understanding of the development of both neuropathologies and resilience to such pathologies.",Gene by Early Life Environment Interaction on Cognitive Decline,9853621,F31AG059395,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Masks ', ' Pathology ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Measures ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Penetrance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' neuropathology ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' high risk ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' health data ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' cognitive ability ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' family support ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' childhood adversity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,45520,0.1040843542749115
"Detecting Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Rural Underserved Communities through Community Based Participatory Research Project Summary There is currently no effective methodology for early detection and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in rural minority older adults, despite their increased risk. The overall objective of this K01 is to propel the development of Dr. Lisa Wiese as an independent researcher in community based participatory research (CBPR) interventions that position her for achieving her career goal of empowering these underserved residents to age-in-place and delay costly institutionalization. Research: The proposed research, Detecting Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in Rural Underserved Communities through Community Based Participatory Research adapts Schoenberg’s proven model of faith-based interventions of education, screening, and referral for rural Appalachian residents (Faith Moves Mountains [FMM] 2009, 2011, 2012, 2016), to a different population and disease. We will apply the FMM intervention to increase a) AD knowledge and awareness of benefits of cognitive screening b) cognitive screening frequency among rural, minority and older adults (SA1). We will assess acceptance of dementia risk disclosure and referral, and evaluate adherence for follow-through with providers (SA2). We will examine the impact of FMM on local healthcare providers’ rates of AD diagnosis and treatment of both referred and non-referred patients (SA3). The findings from this study will inform the discovery of best practices for detection, diagnosis, and early intervention for rural and minority older populations at risk for AD; two groups vastly underrepresented in AD research. Candidate: Dr. Wiese is in her fourth year as an Assistant Professor of Nursing at Florida Atlantic University. Four training goals are designed to enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent, successfully funded investigator: 1. Gain expertise in CBPR for designing and testing a culturally relevant intervention. 2. Enhance skills in developing advanced statistical models for analyzing intervention research. 3. Expand understanding of state of the science regarding aging, health disparities, and AD. 4. Develop leadership skills for executing multicenter studies and mentoring junior researchers. Mentors/Environment: The current career development plan includes experiential learning with Dr. Galvin (as the primary mentor) in his clinical research setting. It also includes training in CBPR, learning advanced statistics through completion of well-established academic coursework, updating knowledge regarding science of aging, disease, and disparities through attendance at National Institute of Aging and Hartford Institutes, and increasing skills as a leader and scholar through monthly Skype or face-to-face meetings with the co-mentor Dr. Lingler, and collaborators Drs. Schoenberg and Williams. Dr. Wiese will continue to receive support from her own institution through internal grants, faculty education, and travel for networking and scholarship. The Office of Nursing Research and Scholarship, which assisted Dr. Wiese with successfully securing several previous small grants, including a summer research release, and multiple publications, has multiple avenues to support junior faculty. Project Narrative The short-term goal of this K01 is the development of the PI as an independent investigator in Community Based Participatory Research to improve health of two groups who are vastly underrepresented in aging research: rural and minority older adults. The K research proposal is the PI’s next step in discovering best practices for Alzheimer’s disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment in these underserved communities. The long-term goal is to mitigate disparities facing rural and minority older adults, thereby empowering their ability to age-in-place and delay costly institutionalization.",Detecting Alzheimer's

"PLAN: Dementia Literacy Education and Navigation for Korean Elders with Probable Dementia and their Caregivers Despite a higher prevalence of dementia, ethnic minority elders in the U.S. are underdiagnosed and at greater risk of not receiving appropriate care than their white counterparts. Early detection of dementia allows for a transition to early dementia care for community-dwelling elderly that may delay or slow deterioration of cognitive functions and functional disabilities and enable families to adequately plan for the potential challenges of dementia caregiving. Currently, little is known about how to effectively identify undiagnosed individuals with probable dementia in community-based settings that serve diverse racial and ethnic minorities and how to transition them into the health care system for necessary diagnostic follow-up and care for dementia. This proposed research addresses the critical gaps by focusing on dementia assessments and follow-up in one of the fastest-growing ethnic minority populations—Korean Americans (KAs). Our collaborative, interdisciplinary research team has more than 10 years of community-based, participatory research experience in the KA community and has laid the groundwork for the current application. In particular, we have conducted the first community-based epidemiological study which estimated the prevalence of dementia among KA elders. Moreover, we successfully trained bilingual community health workers (CHWs) and obtained evidence to support the feasibility and efficacy of using CHWs to assess dementia in community- residing Korean elders and promote linkage to medical service for dementia among KA elders with probable dementia while improving caregiver psychological outcomes. To this end, the goals of our study are to identify community-residing Korean elderly with probable dementia and to test the effects of dementia literacy training and navigation assistance by CHWs to transition affected Korean elders and their caregivers into the healthcare system for adequate diagnostic follow-up and care. CHWs have been used to eliminate health disparities in resource-poor communities with positive outcomes. The adoption of trained CHWs for cognitive health is a new strategic approach which could be highly applicable to many linguistic and/or socially-isolated racial/ethnic minority communities with limited resources. Early detection of dementia allows for a transition to early dementia care that may delay or slow deterioration of cognitive functions and functional disabilities and enable families to adequately plan for the potential challenges of dementia caregiving. Currently, little is known about how to effectively evaluate and screen undiagnosed individuals with probable dementia in community-based settings that serve diverse racial/ethnic minorities and how to transition them into the healthcare system for necessary diagnostic follow-up and care for dementia.

"The Role of Mid-life Psychosocial Stressors, Social Resources and Physiological Dysregulation in Understanding Race Differences in Cognitive Decline ABSTRACT As individuals age, gradual changes in memory, learning and decision-making naturally occur; however, accelerated rates of cognitive decline may be signs of impending impairment and dementia. Racial and ethnic minorities carry a greater dementia burden than whites with a prevalence and incidence rate approximately 2-3 times higher among blacks than whites. These disparities are often attributed to differences in socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, chronic conditions and childhood conditions. While accounting for these factors tends to reduce these disparities, the black-white difference often persists, warranting examination of other determinants of this inequity, particularly at earlier stages of the life course. Recent research suggest that cognitive decline among blacks begins during mid-life. This earlier rate of decline may be due to differential exposure to mid-life acute and chronic stressors. Older racial and ethnic minorities generally report greater exposure to stress compared to whites, which puts them at greater risk for poor health. These stressors can accelerate dysregulation of key physiological systems, including the cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems, which are associated with cognitive outcomes. Thus, race differences in stress exposure that lead to differences in physiological functioning may be one pathway through which stressors differentially affect the cognitive function of blacks and whites. Additionally, social resources, such as social support, engagement and integration are associated with positive cognitive outcomes and may protect against the negative effects of acute and chronic stressors on change in cognitive function. The overarching goal of this proposal is to assess the role of acute and chronic stressors, social resources and physiological dysregulation on black-white differences in change in cognitive function. We will: determine whether acute and chronic stressors during mid- life are associated with cognitive decline and whether they explain black-white differences in cognitive decline (Aim 1); examine whether change in physiological dysregulation mediates the relationship between mid-life stress and cognitive decline (Aim 2); and, determine whether mid-life availability of social resources influences the relationship between stress and cognitive decline (Aim 3). Finally, we will test a conceptual model for cognitive decline that incorporates acute and chronic stressors, social resources and physiological dysregulation across race- and sex-specific groups (Aim 4). To achieve these aims, we will use data from the Health and Retirement Study and linear mixed effects models that include random intercepts and random slopes. The findings from this research will improve our understanding of mid-life factors that influence aging and disparities in cognitive function, thus aligning with Goal B and F of the National Institute on Aging’s Strategic Plan. This research will also help identify points of intervention and modifiable risk and protective factors for cognitive decline, which aligns with the objectives of PA-18-850. PROJECT NARRATIVE The burden of dementia disproportionately affects blacks with a prevalence 2-3 times higher than whites. This disparity may be due to earlier declines in cognitive function among blacks, their disproportionate exposure to stressors and limited access to protective resources during mid-life. To improve our understanding of racial disparities in cognitive function and inform dementia prevention efforts, this project investigates the roles of mid-life acute and chronic stressors, social resources, and physiological dysregulation on black-white difference in cognitive decline.","The Role of Mid-life Psychosocial Stressors, Social Resources and Physiological Dysregulation in Understanding Race Differences in Cognitive Decline",10057959,R21AG065654,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' processing speed ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' stressor ', ' Intercept ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' life-style factor ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Life Stress ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health data ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' family support ', ' black/white disparity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' social engagement ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' protective factors ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,327013,0.07161207621986104
"New Mexico Alzheimer's Disease Research Center ABSTRACT (Overall Core) This proposal is to establish in New Mexico an exploratory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (NM eADRC). The Center goals are: 1) to build infrastructure and hire faculty to enhance Alzheimer's disease (AD) research; 2) to meet the needs of rural communities with health disparities, and 3) to use multimodal biomarkers, including CSF and MRI, to incorporate vascular disease into the new NIA-AA Alzheimer's disease (AD) biological definition, improving patient stratefication. This P20 NM eADRC will build toward the P30 ADRC. We plan to hire new faculty with expertise in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (RD). Infrastructure needs for care of the elderly will be met by the construction of new 7 million dollar building that will house three centers: Movement disorders, Geriatrics, and Center for Memory and Aging, creating synergy in care of the elderly. The NM eADRC will address the unmet needs in dementia care related to disparities, particularly in the large American Indian (AI) population. There are challenges to improving dementia care to AI that include cultural insensitivity, low income and educational levels, and long distances to travel for specialist care. We will overcome these barriers by using community health representatives to perform cognitive screening and a program for mobile on-site screening and testing (MOSST) that includes neuropsychological testing and mobile 1.5T MRI for imaging. This will fill a gap in the national AD databases for data on minorities. Vascular disease is a major co-morbidity with AD that accelerates the cognitive decline. It is estimated that up to 70% of nongenetic AD is mixed dementia (MX), making this an important group to identify prior to autopsy. We have developed biomarkers that can successfully stratify patients. This involves the use of CSF and MRI studies, and allows for the addition of the vascular feature (V) to the amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) components of the NIA-AA formula for diagnosis of AD. Biomarkers in the CSF have been identified by the MarkVCID consortium that indicate inflammation, which occurs when both AD and vascular disease are present. The NM eADRC will measure these unique biomarkers in the newly recruited participants, and provide these services to other ADRCs that are interested. The blood- brain barrier (BBB) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. We plan to measure BBB permeability in gray and white matter in patients with AD and RD along with VCID and MX to better understand its role in dementia. The NM eADRC will be nidus for AD research to a large community of researchers around the state and will be major center within the Medical School Administrative structure. With the ability to bring in new faculty, build new buildings, and bring together the community of scientists interested in dementia in NM, it will make a huge impact that will provide the infrastructure for a successful P30 Center application. Narrative – NM eADRC The New Mexico exploratory Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (NM eADRC) will bridge the gap in health disparities in American Indian (AI) rural communities with mobile MRI and on-site testing, will offer expertise in MRI and biomarkers for vascular disease, and will fund new faculty and infrastructure for the University of New Mexico healthy brain initiative.",New Mexico

"Ethnic-specific Effects of Mitochondrial DNA Variants and Environmental Factors on Cognitive Functioning and Dementia Among U.S race/ethnic groups over 75 years of age, African Americans exhibit the highest cognitive impairment prevalence (32%) followed by Hispanics (23%) and Non-Hispanic Whites (10%). Our proposal implements multiple novel genomic tools designed to capture ethnic-specific targets of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) within the mitochondrial DNA. A novel aspect of our proposal is that we can rapidly translate human mitochondrial genetic associations into cellular and animal experimental paradigms and infer whether these mtSNPs modify mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs), which are a group of micro-peptides that display profound effects on metabolic and neurodegenerative disease processes. We provide evidence in this proposal that we have already identified three mtSNPs in Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics that associate with AD phenotypes in an ethnic-specific fashion through MDPs. In this proposal, we will conduct several novel genetic analyses: (1) Mitochondrial Genome Wide Association Studies (MiWAS), (2) Mitochondrial Genome Wide GxE and GxG Interaction Studies (MiWIS), and (3) mitochondria RNASeq differential expression analysis (mito-transcriptomics), in three large, longitudinal multi-ethnic cohorts with comparable repeated measures of cognitive decline as well as lifestyle and metabolic factors (e.g., body mass index, diabetes, and physical activity). Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohorts, we will conduct discovery MiWAS and MiWIS for Non-Hispanic Whites (n~14,300), African Americans (n~13,400), and Hispanics (n~2,420). We will test replication of findings from HRS and REGARDS on cognitive decline and diagnosis of clinical AD using the diverse Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC) cohorts (n~4,500). We will conduct mito-transcriptomics for all ethnic groups in HRS (n~4,000; white blood cells) and in RADC (n~640; brain prefrontal cortex). Our central hypothesis is that specific mtSNPs and mitochondrial gene expression will predict clinical AD diagnosis and cognitive decline differently by ethnicity. For this project, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team to: 1) Identify ethnic-specific mtSNPs that predict cognitive decline, ADRD, and AD. 2) Identify ethnic-specific mtSNPs that interact with lifestyle factors or nuclear SNPs to affect cognitive decline, ADRD, and AD. 3) Investigate whether genes that encode mitochondrial-derived peptides are differentially expressed relative to AD or ADRD status in different ethnicities.  This project permits discovery of mitochondrial genetic targets that can be explored as precision-based, ethnic-specific, potential ADRD treatment targets, in the form of micro-peptides derived from the mitochondria. Findings from this proposal will be instrumental to AD therapeutic discovery because the makeup of the national population is becoming more ethnically diverse. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD), for which no effective therapy exists, affect millions of people in the US, cost hundreds of billions of dollars in caregiving expenses, and are a source of important racial and ethnic disparities. Education and lifestyle contribute to these disparities, and this project will clarify how genetic factors may also be involved through the application of three novel tools to study mitochondrial genetic variation: 1) mitochondrial genome-wide association studies (MiWAS), 2) mitochondria-wide gene and environment (GxE) interaction scans (MiWIS), and 3) mito-transcriptomics. The proposed analyses will help explain ethnic differences in AD risk and guide immediate diagnostic insights, targeted lifestyle interventions, and novel therapeutic target

"APRISE Dementia (Assessing Population-based Radiological brain health in Stroke Epidemiology-Dementia) DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT: Dementia is a major burden, costing more than cancer and heart disease, and expected to double by 2060, and disproportionately in African-Americans. Among the parameters leading to post stroke dementia (PSD), vascular causes, including small vessel disease, represent a silent epidemic in need of further characterization epidemiologically. Further population-based studies of PSD, both in terms of incidence and characterization, are needed in the United States to allow for national projections and public health planning. Currently, we also lack an established prediction tool for PSD. A Framingham-like “Risk Function Tool for Post-Stroke Dementia,” especially one incorporating the full gamut of modern imaging parameters developed in a racially diverse population, would likely identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions. Moreover, it may reveal novel causal pathways and risk factors for future investigation. We propose an ancillary study to the NIH-funded Assessing Population-based Radiological brain health in Stroke Epidemiology (APRISE) study entitled, APRISE-Dementia. Our objective is to build on the GCNKSS and APRISE infrastructures which will have radiologically characterized the full stroke/TIA population of Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky from 2015 and created the first modern, largely MRI-based characterization of brain health in a contemporary stroke/TIA population, and determine the population-based incidence, clinical and demographic features, and predictors of PSD up to five years after the incident stroke/TIA. Our specific aim is to create a prediction model of PSD incorporating imaging parameters in a biracial ischemic stroke/hemorrhagic stroke/TIA population using state-of-the-art modeling approaches. We hypothesize that diagnosis of PSD (within five years from index stroke event) will be better predicted by incorporating imaging parameters compared to traditional vascular risk factors alone. We will achieve these goals in a remarkably cost- and time-efficient manner by leveraging the extensive imaging, clinical and demographic data of stroke/TIA patients from 2015 already being collected in the currently funded APRISE and GCKNSS grants. Our project will not only provide the first population-level incidence of PSD projected nationally and innovatively utilize the entire imaging spectrum of brain health for prediction, but it will also generate novel hypotheses for prospective validation and refinement in the prospective NINDS/NIA- funded U19 DISCOVERY cohort. With the infrastructures already in place, we are uniquely ready to address these urgent questions. NARRATIVE Post-stroke dementia (PSD) rates in the US are not well understood and would allow for better public health planning. The APRISE-Dementia study will analyze medical records to determine the population-level rate of PSD and to create prediction models that use state-of-the-art modeling and brain imaging

"State and Local Educational Contexts of Older U.S. Adults and Their Association with Cognitive Impairment and Dementia PROJECT SUMMARY Educational attainment, often conceptualized and measured as a human capital attribute, is one of the strongest predictors of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) among older adults and perhaps the most important protective factor against cognitive impairment and dementia. Recently documented declines in prevalence and incidence of dementia have been attributed to historical increases in educational attainment. As trends in rising educational attainment slow, it is expected that reductions in the prevalence of ADRD will as well. While it is true that variability in levels of educational attainment has diminished over time, older adults experienced vastly different educational contexts across birth cohorts and by race, particularly Black older adults who grew up in the U.S. South. Consider that from 1920 to 1980, per-pupil spending increased 6-fold, funding allocation became more evenly split between state and local governments, and de jure school segregation was declared unconstitutional. Thus, even if educational attainment remains steady in more recent cohorts, inequities in early life educational contexts may serve to differentiate individuals in their risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. Our project addresses this neglected area of dementia research by addressing four questions: (1) what were the state and local educational contexts experienced by Black and White older adults across birth cohorts; (2) does education operate differently to reduce risk for cognitive impairment or dementia when it is attained under more (or less) advantaged educational contexts among Black and White older adults; (3) do life course pathways encompassing occupation, marriage, behavior, and health explain the relationship between educational contexts and cognitive impairment and dementia and does this vary by educational attainment; and (4) how does state-level variation in the timing of school desegregation efforts and in the extent of court mandated desegregation orders relate to cognitive impairment among Black and White older adults who lived in the U.S. South during school? We will answer these questions through the creation of a rich, longitudinal data resource of state and local educational contexts that we will link to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of U.S. adults over 50. We will estimate variation in these relationships by birth cohort and race. Expected outcomes of this study include (a) the development of the Education Contextual Data Resource (ECDR) that we will make available to the scientific community to answer other timely questions about educational contexts and ADRD, significantly expanding the reach of our project’s impact; and (b) insights into broader population trends in ADRD prevalence and racial disparities in ADRD, allowing us to identify the subgroups at greatest risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide important insights into broader population trends in ADRD prevalence and racial disparities in ADRD by considering how education operates differently to reduce risk for cognitive impairment and dementia under more (or less) advantaged educational contexts. The proposed research is relevant to several NIA priorities in the area of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), including identifying early life risk and protective factors for ADRD and the linkage of administrative data to existing longitudinal cohort studies.",State and Local Educational Contexts of Older U.S. Adults and Their Association with Cognitive Impairment and Dementia,10290755,R01AG067536,"['demographics ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Preservice teacher ', ' future faculty ', ' pre-service teacher ', ' student teacher ', ' Future Teacher ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Population-based trends ', ' Population trends ', ' data resource ', ' protective factors ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Marriage ', ' Local Government ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Public Health ', ' Pupil ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Schools ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' court ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Desegregation ', ' Funding ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Shapes ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Occupational ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' behavioral health ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' human capital ', ' neglect ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' user-friendly ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' ']",NIA,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,379346,0.07179374065285317
"Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Core Center Overall – Project Summary  This application proposes a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSOM) to provide a comprehensive infrastructure for research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD. Our Center will provide innovative resources to examine the contributions of metabolic and vascular factors to early phase transitions from normal aging to MCI and then to AD and other dementias, through coordinated research spanning the translational spectrum. Wake Forest is uniquely equipped to rapidly develop a high-impact ADCC because it has: 1) a deep, interdisciplinary foundation in aging research; 2) specialized expertise in metabolic and vascular factors and their relationship to cognitive aging and dementia; 3) strong ties to an ethnically diverse community with high prevalence of dementia and metabolic/vascular disorders; and 4) exceptional institutional support. The rationale for our theme is based on research showing that metabolic and vascular disorders are highly prevalent, modifiable factors that contribute to the transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias. To promote innovative translational research focused on these factors, the ADCC will enroll an observational multi-ethnic cohort from an existing 15-year study of metabolic/vascular risk, and leverage their extensive data by adding key endpoints to characterize AD and other dementias. The Clinical Core will enroll a separate cohort enriched for metabolic/vascular risk, along with participants with AD. The ADCC will focus on African-American (AA) and other underserved groups who are twice as likely to develop AD, and have high rates of diabetes and vascular disease. Specialized resources will be available to ADCC investigators, including non-human primate (NHP) models for translational research. A repository of human and NHP biospecimens, genetic/epigenetic data, and extensive clinical data will be available to NACC, NCRAD, and other investigators. The ADCC will also serve as a resource for a broad spectrum of AD initiatives. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Establish a comprehensive integrated research infrastructure focused on phase transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and other dementias, and provide special resources to accelerate research on metabolic and vascular factors; 2) Optimize the participation of AA adults to better understand the causes underlying their increased risk of AD and dementia; 3) Expand relationships with the national ADCC network and key affiliates such as NACC and NCRAD; 4) Provide training in translational research to new investigators, and education regarding AD and dementia to professionals, patients and families, and the community. The prevalence of metabolic and vascular risk factors, their importance to AD expression, the strengths of the Wake Forest scientific community in these research areas, and our outstanding institutional commitment are indicators that NIH funding will be successfully leveraged to establish an ADCC that will make high-impact contributions to the field. Overall – Project Narrative  This application seeks to establish a new Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (ADCC) at Wake Forest School of Medicine that will provide a comprehensive infrastructure for translational, interdisciplinary research on the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of AD and related disorders. Our ADCC will focus on the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and then to AD and other dementias, and understanding the contribution of metabolic and vascular factors to these transitions. The ADCC will enroll a diverse group of ~1,000 adults to facilitate the discovery of new biomarkers and promising targets for prevention and therapy. We will also utilize novel nonhuman primate models to promote pivotal mechanistic and translational research. Finally, we will educate new investigators in translational research practices, and health professionals, afflicted adults, their families, and their communities about AD and strategies for reducing

"Arterial stiffness, brain morphology, cognition, and dementia in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos Cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are pressing public health concerns as the population ages. In the U.S., Hispanics/Latinos have a higher MCI and ADRD risk compared with other population groups, and they are expected to contribute disproportionately to the expected increase in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ADRD. Factors explaining this disparity are unknown. Higher central arterial stiffness is posited to alter microvasculature structure and function in the brain contributing to cerebral small vessel disease and with cognitive impairment and risk of ADRD in older white and black adults. No reports to date have examined these associations in a large, diverse Hispanic/Latino population. Similarly, the important roles of sex, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes in these associations have not been assessed. U.S. Hispanics/Latinos have a high burden of cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with both greater arterial stiffness and risk of ADRD and could contribute to the health disparity in MCI and ADRD. We propose to address these gaps in an ancillary study to the 2019-2022 Visit 3 examination of ~9,297 participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), an ongoing cohort study of well-characterized U.S. Hispanic/Latinos. We propose to add pulse wave velocity, a non-invasive arterial stiffness measurement, to participants ≥45 years old during Visit 3 (n ~7,020). All other data will be available from HCHS/SOL and its two ancillary studies. The Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) will provide data on cognitive performance and MCI and dementia classification for cohort members ≥45 years old at Visit 3 (~6,272). INCA-MRI will provide brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data on a sample of cohort members (2017-2019, n ~2,800). The study aims are the following: Aim 1. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and cerebral small vessel disease (cerebral white matter hyperintensities, white matter integrity, and infarcts) overall and by sex. Aim 2. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and domain-specific cognitive function overall and by sex in participants ≥45 years old. Aim 3. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and MCI and ADRD overall and by sex in participants ≥45 years old. For all aims, we will evaluate obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes as potential modifiers. This cost-efficient ancillary study will, for the first time, contribute novel information on the association of central arterial stiffness and brain structure and function in a large sample of Hispanic/Latinos, a population burdened with a high levels of metabolic impairments. Additionally, the inclusion of middle-aged adults will provide insights into opportunities for early intervention prior to onset of overt disease. Understanding how arterial stiffness influences cognitive impairment and ADRD will contribute novel information on identifying potential targets for intervention, reducing health disparities, and the promoting cognitive resilience. This study examines the relationship of stiffening of the arteries and damage to small vessels in the brain, reduced cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease-associated dementias. We propose to add a measure of stiffness of the arteries to the 2019-2022 re-examination of an existing, NHLBI sponsored cohort, the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos; information on risk factors, damage to small vessels in the brain, cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's associated dementias will come from the existing study and its sub studies. This study will provide new information on how stiffening of the arteries relates to brain structure and function in Hispanics/Latinos that can inform public health efforts to reduce health disparities and to identify potential targets to lower the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease associated dementias.","Arterial stiffness, brain morphology, cognition, and dementia in

"The Engaging Communities of Hispanics for Aging Research (ECHAR) Network Abstract Hispanics/Latinos (H/Ls), the largest ethnic minority in the U.S., are 50% likelier than non-Hispanic whites to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD). H/Ls also live longer, develop AD symptoms earlier, are diagnosed at later stages, and are less likely to be treated. It is projected that U.S. H/Ls living with Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD) will increase by over 800% by 2060. Despite comprising 17% of the U.S. population, H/Ls represent less than 1% of participants in NIH-funded clinical trials and less than 8% of NIH AD Research Centers, greatly limiting understanding of underlying causes of disparities. There is a critical need to increase recruitment of H/Ls into AD research, but health literacy gaps may impact research participation. Without engaging H/Ls to address AD health literacy, engaging larger numbers of H/Ls into research will be unlikely. The long-term goal of the proposed Engaging Communities of Hispanics for Aging Research (ECHAR) Network is to address effective recruitment of H/Ls into aging and ADRD research. The overall objective of the proposed collaborative, transdisciplinary network is to engage, educate, and motivate H/L community members for participation in ADRD research by addressing ADRD-related communication. Resting on a central hypothesis that poor health literacy sustains health disparities, examining and leveraging community knowledge will inform development of targeted recruitment strategies. Given the nature of this complex, multi- factorial problem, effective recruitment of H/Ls must include a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach. Targeting the stated goal, the ECHAR Network capitalizes on the combined strength of community residents and patient/volunteer liaisons, health agencies and community-based organizations, and researchers in two metro areas home to nearly 1.2 million H/Ls. Through use of a novel community-based participatory method known as Boot Camp Translation (BCT), ECHAR aims to 1) inspire and recruit community members and patient/volunteer liaisons to become part of the recruitment infrastructure, 2) develop innovative community- relevant Alzheimer’s-related awareness, education, and recruitment materials, and 3) support research infrastructure and facilitate enrollment of H/L individuals entering aging and ADRD research. These aims are in line with the NIA National Strategy for Recruitment and Participation in ADRD Clinical Research. By the end of this project, ECHAR will have: (1) established and trained community advisory committees on ADRD; (2) developed key, culturally-informed, ADRD-related materials as well as dissemination and evaluation strategies for H/L recruitment into aging and ADRD research; and (3) developed sustainable research infrastructure to enhance outreach by supporting health disparities investigators and pilot grants. To that end, this work will provide insights and validated strategies to recruit H/Ls. Narrative Hispanic/Latino (H/L) individuals are at increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) but are less likely to participate in research, with health literacy and poor communication identified as key barriers. We propose to create a collaborative, transdisciplinary network that aims to engage, educate, and motivate H/L community members to participate in research in Houston, TX and Denver, CO, which are home to a combined 1.182 million H/Ls. This will be done through use of a novel community-based participatory method known as Boot Camp Translation (BCT) to 1) inspire and recruit community members and patient/volunteer liaisons to become part of the recruitment infrastructure, 2) develop innovative community- relevant Alzheimer’s-related awareness, education, and recruitment materials, and 3) support research infrastructure and facilitate enrollment of H/L individuals entering aging and ADRD research.",The Engaging Communities of Hispanics for Aging Research (ECHAR) Network,9855154,R24AG065170,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Awareness ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Incubators ', ' Language ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' volunteer ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R24,2020,749708,0.037857954159254976
"Spontaneous Speech and Health Disparities in Risk of Cognitive Decline: WHICAP Offspring Ancillary Study Project Summary/Abstract The proposed ancillary study looks to better understand racial/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by investigating spontaneous speech as part of the Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) Offspring Study. Limitations of existing cognitive screening instruments is a known contributor to racial/ethnic disparities in AD and recent work suggests that speech analysis may be a sensitive marker of cognitive decline and future AD. New technological advances raise the possibility that automated speech analysis could be conducted using smartphones in community settings, creating an inexpensive and scalable approach to early detection. However, many challenges remain in developing this method, including a very limited understanding of the biological underpinnings of spontaneous speech in at-risk individuals (e.g., hippocampal volume, amyloid deposition, contribution of executive function vs. language). We propose to examine spontaneous speech as part of the ongoing WHICAP Offspring Study (RF1AG054070, RF1AG058067). This large project is enrolling a diverse cohort (>70% minorities) of pre-clinical participants with varying degrees of risk for AD using medical, genetic, and neuropsychological testing (N = 3000), structural MRI (N = 1000), and amyloid and tau PET imaging (N = 150 for each). Both English and Spanish speakers are included. One measure of spontaneous speech has been included since study onset and a second brief measure would be added. We hypothesize that spontaneous speech will reflect a combination of both biological and sociocultural risk factors to AD and that bilingualism will show protective effects. By leveraging the rich data collection of the WHICAP Offspring Study, this application would generate substantial new insight into the basic underpinnings of spontaneous speech in diverse pre-clinical samples, as well as determine the feasibility of using speech analysis as a novel biomarker of AD risk. Additionally, should the cohort be followed longitudinally, the ability of spontaneous speech to predict future incidence of AD in racially/ethnically diverse samples over time could also be evaluated. Project Narrative African Americans and Hispanics are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than non-Hispanic Whites. Limited accuracy of cognitive screening measures is a contributor to racial/ethnic disparities in AD and recent research suggests that analysis of spontaneous speech may be a sensitive marker of brain changes. The proposed study will add measures of spontaneous speech to the Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) Offspring Study and generate new insight into language function in pre-clinical AD and the feasibility of using speech analysis as a novel biomarker for AD risk.",Spontaneous Speech and Health Disparities in Risk of Cognitive Decline: WHICAP Offspring Ancillary

The overarching goal of this study is to further the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology, including Aβ and tau pathology and neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular reactivity and midlife CaVD. To achieve these goals, we will utilize a group non-demented participants from an existing cohort from the ongoing community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with a cohort of 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years at study entry and has collected a wealth of longitudinal vascular measures. We hypothesize that subclinical CaVD identified in midlife is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease pathology expressed as amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration. These changes in brain structure would be associated with alterations in cognition both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We further hypothesize that the change in cognition will result from a failure of vascular compensatory responses, marked by increases in regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CaVD) are two of the most common disorders of aging, understanding the relationship between the pathologies of these two disorders is critically important. The goal of this study is to furthe the understanding of the relationship between AD pathology and midlife CaVD. We will utilize a group 80 participants with a wealth of existing CaVD data from the Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation (Heart SCORE) study, a longitudinal study that began in 2003 with 2000 participants (43% black) between the ages of 45-75 years. Our goal is to understand how CaVD and AD pathology interact to produce cognitive changes in the elderly.",Role of midlife cardiovascular disease on Alzheimer’s Pathology and cerebrovascular

"Community-based approach to Early Identification of transitions to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in African Americans With the rapid increase in longevity and considerable expansion of the share of elderly in the population, it is becoming ever important to understand the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive declines in order to guide environmental and clinical interventions for older adults and for more accurate prediction of risk for dementia [e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD)]. A crucial challenge of aging research is improving understanding of the neurobiological basis of conditions leading to dementia, in order to refine the diagnostic procedures and to target new behavioral and pharmacological interventions. A main avenue for the neurobiological understanding of very early risk processes leading to dementia would be the screening of large populations at risk by means of quick, low-cost, and widely available procedures. The present proposal will test to what extent computerized cognitive tests and portable electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to easily, accurately and efficiently evaluate early cognitive decline in elderly at risk for developing AD.  Health disparities represent a critical roadblock mitigating the social and fiscal benefits of early identification and care, not only to the individual patient and family, but also at the state and federal levels. Community-dwelling, African-American elders show faster rates of cognitive decline and are almost twice as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD as are older, white Americans. However, they are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment in the early stages of these disorders. Development of economically viable and culturally acceptable methods of early detection is critical in minority populations.  We propose to identify the first signs of dementia in at risk African Americans with subjective memory complaints (SMC) in their communities within the Detroit metro area by using computerized cognitive tests CogState and NIH Toolbox and a portable EEG. We plan to combine cross-sectional with longitudinal studies: within the first two years, we will cognitively evaluate a total of 500 at risk African Americans with SMC. From these participants we will select 200 who at entry to the longitudinal study will not be diagnosed with either dementia or MCI but will, however, undergo repeated cognitive and EEG testing every 6 months over a 3 year period. We will compare these approaches of repeated cognitive and EEG/ Event-Related Potentials (ERP) testing in terms of their sensitivity of identifying persons already at risk who will progress to MCI and/or AD.  Our proposed community based evaluation that combines behavioral and EEG/ERP methods will be used to generate profiles of at risk healthy elderly African-Americans, who may within a short period of time develop MCI or AD. We expect that with the combination of behavioral and EEG/ERP methods, we will be able to develop objective markers, which will reliably identify early signs of cognitive decline. Such markers will be used for identification of significant cognitive decline, and to evaluate efficiency of new pharmacological approaches, which will lead to the development of new therapeutic interventions and disease modification. Narrative Community dwelling African American elders have faster rates of cognitive decline and are almost twice as likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than are older white Americans, but are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment in the early stages of these disorders. Development of reasonable, economically viable, and culturally acceptable methods of early detection are thus critical in minority populations. The proposed experiments (e.g., use of computerized cognitive testing and portable electrophysiology) are intended to better characterize at risk African Americans and to develop new markers for detection of the earliest cognitive changes in healthy elders who may be at risk for the development of MCI or who may go on to develop AD.",Community-based approach to Early Identification of

"Arterial Stiffness and Brain Health in African Americans Cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are pressing public health concerns as the population ages. In the U.S., African Americans have a high risk of ADRD compared with other population groups; however, factors explaining this disparity are unknown. Greater central arterial stiffness is posited to alter microvasculature structure and function in the brain, contributing to cerebral small vessel disease, cognitive impairment, and risk of ADRD. No reports to date have examined these associations in a large, well-characterized African American population. Similarly, the salient roles of sex, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension in these associations have not been addressed, although African Americans have a high burden of cardiometabolic risk factors and hypertension that are associated with both greater arterial stiffness and risk of ADRD. We propose to examine these gaps in an ancillary study to the 2020-2022 Exam 4 of ~2,700 participants, ages 41-104 years, in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an ongoing and deeply phenotyped cohort of African Americans. We propose to add pulse wave velocity, a non-invasive arterial stiffness measurement, to all participants during Exam 4. All other data will be available from JHS and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS). To evaluate temporal change in arterial stiffness, we will leverage existing arterial stiffness measures from those who also participated in the ARIC-NCS Visit 5 (2011- 2013, N=1,078). The study aims are the following: Aim 1. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and the burden of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, subcortical infarcts, and markers of brain atrophy. Aim 2. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and domain-specific cognitive function. Aim 3. Characterize the 8-year change in central arterial stiffness and its association with the burden of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, subcortical infarcts, and brain volumes at Exam 4 among older adults in participants in both the ARIC-NCS and JHS studies. For all aims, we will evaluate sex, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension as potential effect modifiers. This cost-efficient ancillary study will, for the first time, contribute information on the association of central arterial stiffness and brain structure and function in a large sample of African Americans, a population exposed to high levels of hypertension and metabolic impairments and at risk for ADRD. The inclusion of middle-aged adults and measures of cerebral small vessel disease, cerebral infarcts, and impaired cognitive function will provide insights into opportunities for intervention prior to onset of cognitive impairment or overt ADRD. Understanding how arterial stiffness influences brain health will contribute novel information toward reducing health disparities and promoting cognitive resilience. This study is focused on the stiffening of the arteries and the associated structural damage to small vessels in the brain and reduced cognitive function that precede cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. We propose to add a measure of artery stiffness to the 2020-2022 re-examination of the Jackson Heart Study; information on risk factors, damage to small vessels in the brain and cognitive performance will come from the existing study and as well as measures of artery stiffness in subset of participants that also participated in the 2011-2013 visit of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities- Neurocognitive study. This study will provide new information on how stiffening of the arteries relate to brain structure and function in African Americans that can inform efforts to reduce health disparities and to identify potential targets to lower the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",Arterial Stiffness and Brain Health in African Americans,9947847,R01AG062488,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral Infarction ', ' cerebral infarct ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' insight ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' lacunar infarcts ', ' lacunar stroke ', ' Lacunar Infarctions ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' processing speed ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' artery stiffening ', ' artery stiffness ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' brain volume ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' resilience ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' high risk ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' brain health ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ', ' recruit ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,581069,0.14002587267173489
"Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia Overall Project Summary The over-arching goal of the Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia (HASD) study is to determine the factors that signal the imminent development of symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) in cognitively normal older adults. In pursuing this goal, HASD also will examine whether these predictive factors differ between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites, are influenced by sleep, or might be offset by genetic variants that protect against developing symptomatic AD. Finally, HASD will evaluate a novel method of assessing cognitive performance in naturalistic settings via a smartphone application. To accomplish these goals, HASD will assess and follow a richly phenotyped cohort that includes both cognitively normal older adults (~75%) and those with early-stage symptomatic AD (~25%). The longitudinal assessment protocol includes standard and novel clinical and cognitive measures, a six-day in-home sleep study, magnetic structural imaging studies of the brain, positron emission tomography studies of the brain to reveal the cerebral hallmarks of AD, amyloid-beta plaques and tau deposition, and examination of blood for genetic studies and of cerebrospinal fluid for levels of amyloid-beta and tau. Five Cores (Administration, Clinical, Biostatistics, Neuropathology [includes the Biofluids Laboratory], and Imaging) will support four Projects that carry out the scientific aims of HASD: Project 1: “Characterization of Molecular Biomarker Profiles of AD throughout its Pathobiological Continuum” Project 2: “Sleep and Orexin: Potential Markers of Progression from Preclinical to Mildly Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease” Project 3: “Dissecting the Genetic Architecture of Resilience” Project 4: “Smartphone-Based `Burst' Cognitive Assessments” Overall Project Narrative The over-arching goal of the Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia (HASD) study is to determine those factors that signal the imminent development of Alzheimer disease (AD) in cognitively normal older adults.

"Risk factors for MCI and Dementia in a Diverse Senior Cohort ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Risk factors for MCI and dementia in a diverse senior cohort. Community-based research on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia includes relatively few longitudinal studies that include low-income minority seniors. PAR 15-356 specifically welcomes projects that propose augmenting existing longitudinal cohort studies, enhancing the power of multi- ethnic cohort studies, and exploring trends in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose to use intensive community-based outreach to recruit 800 seniors from a low-SES group of boroughs whose population is 60% African American (AA). These boroughs, comprising the 15104 ZIP code, are within the study area of MYHAT (R01AG023651), an ongoing population- based cohort study of cognitive impairment and dementia in 2000+ randomly selected seniors in southwestern PA. By using the MYHAT assessment protocol in the proposed new 15104 volunteer cohort, we will collect identical data and cost-effectively leverage the MYHAT data by pooling the two cohorts for analysis. Using appropriate sampling weights to adjust our estimates for non-random sample selection of the 15104 cohort, we will examine risk and resilience factors within the pooled cohort. We will identify factors associated with MCI at baseline, and, through annual follow-up assessments, identify risk factors for subsequent cognitive decline and dementia. Particularly, but not exclusively, we will focus on risk factors common among AA seniors: low education, poor educational quality, low health literacy, APOE*4 genotype, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. We will then determine whether race modifies the relationship between risk factors and adverse cognitive outcomes. Enhancing the participation of minority seniors will allow us to take a critical first step towards addressing the challenges of investigating, and eventually addressing, cognitive health disparities in the population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Between 2006 and 2008, we assembled a community-based cohort of over 2,000 adults, aged  65+ years, by randomly selecting individuals from the Voter Registration lists for a group  of small towns municipalities in a Rust Belt area of southwestern Pennsylvania . The study  is called the Monongahela- Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT). We now propose to use intensive community outreach within 3 towns in the same area, with  enthusiastic support from the town Mayors, to recruit a sample of 800 volunteers who are  60% African Americans.

"Alzheimer's care management in minority groups: Identifying warning signs and  crisis points in transitions from informal to formal care management in African American and  Latino populations Project Abstract Alzheimer's is a growing concern in Hispanic and African American populations, with increased incidence and earlier age of onset as compared to the non-Hispanic White population. Informal caregivers provide the majority of care for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD),with Hispanic and African American caregivers accessing formal care systems less frequently and at later stages compared to non-Hispanic White families. Community organizations serving persons with Alzheimer's in Milwaukee county long recognize the lag in informal care systems transitioning primary care management to formal paid care, waiting until a crisis in inability to provide care, and/or inability to maintain the health and safety for the patient within the informal care system occurs. However, it is unclear what early warning signs preceded the crisis and what formal care providers, including physicians, social work, nursing, family workers and dementia care specialists, know about warning signs and crisis in these families. Data and discussions from a multi-stakeholder community coalition suggest that formal and informal systems of care may diverge in their interpretation of early warning signs, crisis points and cultural considerations around care transitions. Thus assessing what both the caregiver and healthcare professional know about early warning signs and how both groups interpret this information will inform the development of culturally adapted, pre-crisis interventions. This study aims to identify both family and formal care providers' views of care transitions, warning signs and care crisis points, and where their views of these situations both converge and diverge. The proposed study will collect family and service provider level data from up to 240 African American and Hispanic family caregivers (including adult and youth key informants), and 50 service providers recruited through a community coalition, including the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Medical College of Wisconsin, The United Community Center, Alzheimer's Association and Milwaukee County Department on Aging. This study will be the first to identify culturally relevant warning signs to guide the development of culturally adapted informal and formal educational interventions with African American and Hispanic communities, designed to avert care crises. It will also nuance the caregiving paradigm through the inclusion of youth caregivers, providing the first insight into the youth view of caregiving transitions and what they see as warning signs and crisis points, adding dimension to informal caregiving knowledge and programming. The proposed study engages several community-based service providers, focusing on the need to understanding cultural issues in caregiving through the lens of organizations that are accessed and trusted by the target population. Results will contribute to the NIA mission to improve the well-being of AD patients and caregivers by developing a better understanding of caregiving needs and the disparities inherent in the transition from informal to formal care management. Narrative statement This study is relevant to both the mission of the NIA and public health by providing information on previously unknown warning signs and care crisis points leading to a transition of primary care between informal and formal care management in African American and Hispanic families with Alzheimer's or related dementias (ADRD). Utilizing a community based approach, this study uniquely engages adult and youth caregivers, and community based service providers to assess early warning signs and disparities identified by informal caregivers and formal care providers. Results are expected to inform care coordination and education interventions for underserved African American and Hispanic patients with ADRD, caregivers and formal care providers.",Alzheimer's care management in minority groups: Identifying warning signs and  crisis points in transitions from informal to formal care management in African American and  Latino populations,10159537,R21AG061307,"['Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Communities ', ' Crisis Intervention ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Target Populations ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' County ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Age of Onset ', ' insight ', ' Trust ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' patient safety ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' community based service ', ' community organizations ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' community center ', ' informal care ', ' Informal care giver ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giving ', ' informal caregiving ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' service providers ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', "" Alzheimer's care "", "" Alzheimer's disease care "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2020,42721,0.0678078534604838
"Education and the Life-Course Pathways of Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, and Cognitive Decline in the United States and Mexico PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of the proposed research is to describe and cross-nationally compare the life-course pathways affecting cognition, cognitive impairment, dementia, and cognitive decline in the United States and Mexico. The PI, Dr. Joseph Saenz, received his Ph.D. in Population Health Science at the University of Texas Medical Branch where he received training in epidemiology and epidemiologic methods. Dr. Saenz has extensive experience studying health disparities in Mexico and the Mexican origin population in the United States. Joseph is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California (USC) where he has begun to study cognition in these populations. The proposed training will enhance the PI’s understanding of the measurement of cognition, and expose him to the approaches to cognitive aging used across various academic disciplines including demography, psychology, neuropsychology, and biology. Education is a strong predictor of cognitive function, cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), and dementia in late life. Education may affect the clinical manifestation of cognitive functioning directly by impacting the strength and structure of brain structures and by providing greater cognitive reserve to compensate for pathological changes in the brain. However, education may also affect cognition via indirect pathways including occupation, income, wealth, healthcare access, and chronic conditions. Understanding these pathways is highly significant given the aging of the U.S. and Mexican populations and the social and economic costs of cognitive impairment. Because aging is a life-course process that occurs within larger contexts, it is important to consider how larger demographic, economic, and political contexts across countries influence cognitive development and decline throughout the life-course. Further, by acknowledging these differing contexts, future work may design and implement cognitive interventions that are more precisely catered to the context in which they are applied. These results also shed light on differences in cognitive aging across developing and developed countries. While studies of aging in Mexico (Mexican Health and Aging Study) and the U.S. (Health and Retirement Study) have used differing measures of cognitive functioning and methods for measuring and classifying normal cognition, CIND, and dementia, the proposed research makes use of newly collected harmonized assessments of cognitive functioning to develop comparable measures of cognition and definitions of CIND and dementia. I will investigate the direct and indirect pathways throughout the life-course through which education affects cognitive functioning, CIND, dementia, and cognitive decline in late life using multinomial probit regression models, growth curve models, and linear regression models to model CIND and dementia, cognitive decline, and cognitive function as a function of variables spanning the life-course. USC is an ideal location to receive the training necessary for the proposal given the multidisciplinary nature of the gerontology center, global study of aging, focus on cognition and dementia, and availability of coursework and mentorship from leaders in demography, psychology, and clinical psychology. This training will also position the PI to begin an independent research career and to submit a successful R01 proposal in a faculty position. PROJECT NARRATIVE Education is strongly predictive of cognitive function and cognitive impairment in late life, the proposed research will cross-nationally examine the direct and indirect life-course pathways through which education influences cognition in late life in Mexico and the United States. These results will deepen our understanding of the role of education in cognitive function, and how larger demographic and social contexts may modify the pathogenesis of disease. Findings will suggest how, and at what stage of the life-course, societal resources should be allocated to be used most effectively.","Education and the Life-Course Pathways of Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, and Cognitive Decline in the United States and Mexico",10113710,R00AG058799,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Cognition ', ' Financial cost ', ' Demography ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Mexico ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Pathology ', ' Politics ', ' Population Growth ', ' Psychology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Texas ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' career ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' cognitive function ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' health knowledge ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' economic cost ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' cost ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' population health ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R00,2020,248432,0.11038927676254708
"UAB Alzheimer's Disease Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The thematic focus of the proposed exploratory UAB Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) is on Deep South disparities in Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals born in the Deep South (traditionally defined as the five-state region spanning LA, MS, AL, GA, and SC) have high rates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias relative to other regions. The most likely explanation for this observation is that several large populations disparately impacted by AD are concentrated in the Deep South. For example, the region is home to the nation’s largest population identifying as Black or African American, who are estimated to be at as much as double the risk of AD. The Deep South also a very large rural population, with disparities in social determinants of health (income, education, health care access, and related factors) that strongly influence AD risk. Likewise, vascular risks and related medical comorbidities such as diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and obesity are each most prevalent in the Deep South and associated with AD.  Our vision is a future in which these Deep South disparities in AD are eliminated. Realizing this vision requires a deeper understanding of the unique factors driving AD in the region, which is the goal of our center. We have already launched our cores in a pilot phase with institutional support and propose during the P20 phase to consolidate this collaborative team and demonstrate our capacity for outreach, recruitment, enrollment, and data/biospecimen collection from a representative Deep South population, in preparation for a future P30-funded Center. We will build on our initial success in establishing a cohort with substantial inclusion of Black or African American participants, create a second recruitment and evaluation site in western Jefferson County to facilitate minority and rural participation, and generate evidence of our capacity to collect a unique and comprehensive collection of data and biospecimens informative about Deep South disparities in AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alzheimer’s disease is a pressing challenge for our nation and disparately affects diverse populations in the Deep South. The UAB Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) will contribute to the fight against Alzheimer’s disease by accelerating AD research at UAB, across the Deep South, and nationally.",UAB Alzheimer's

"R01 Upstream Approaches to Improve Late Life Care for People Living with Dementia PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal is to improve the quality of end-of-life care provided to families and people living with Alz- heimer’s disease and its related dementias (dementia) by generating population-level evidence on the public health impact of community-based support structures including skilled home health care. Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis in racial and ethnic minority populations is projected to more than double by 2030. Large racial and ethnic differences and disparities exist in well-established end-of-life care quality indicators (inpatient admis- sions, hospice use, place of death), and in people living with dementia some of these differences may be com- pounded. One understudied approach to improving dementia care among racial/ethnic minority and socioeco- nomically disadvantaged populations is the use of skilled home health care (a benefit under Medicare and Medicaid). The short-term goal for this R01 is to define racial/ethnic differences in the effects of skilled home health care on indicators of end-of-life care quality (e.g., inpatient admissions, use of hospice, and place of death) as a function of dementia diagnosis. The central hypothesis is that “upstream” exposure to home health care prior to and during the final year of life has a cumulative and beneficial effect on ""downstream” end-of-life care quality indicators: (1) inpatient admissions, (2) hospice utilization, and (3) place of death. The scientific premise for this work is that PLwD have complex medical and behavioral health needs, and many rely on fam- ily caregivers to help with activities of daily living and coordination of medical care. Too few benefit from skilled home health care. As cognitive function deteriorates from mild symptoms and behavioral changes to more ad- vanced illness, skilled home health care may help prevent avoidable hospitalizations, and minimize burden- some transitions across care settings at the end-of-life. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursing three specific aims: Examine the relationship between receiving skilled home health care prior to and during the last year of life and: 1) inpatient admissions (type, frequency and length) in the last year of life, 2) hospice utiliza- tion (timing and setting) in the last year of life, and 3) place of death (e.g., hospital, home, hospice in a hospital, hospice at home). The aims will be tested using linked Medicare data sets to examine the effect of skilled home health care utilization on racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life outcomes among people diagnosed with dementia compared to people not diagnosed with dementia. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it focuses on evaluating an underutilized core benefit of Medi- care through evaluating the effect of skilled home health care access on disparities in dementia care quality. Successful completion of proposal aims will have a sustained and powerful impact by providing needed and actionable evidence to reduce disparities in care for racial and ethnic minority older adults living with dementia. The project will significantly impact the design, development, and evaluation of population health system inter- ventions to eliminate or reduce disparities in care and end-of-life outcomes among people living with dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on actionable evidence to improve national efforts focused on reducing disparities in care for racial and ethnic minority older adults living with dementia. Once such strategies have been developed, there is the potential for a significant advance in population health system interventions to reduce disparities in end-of-life outcomes among people living with dementia. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) priority area regarding the role of access to care among health disparity populations and quality of care related to Alzheimer’s Disease and its Related Dementias diagnosis, treatment, and health disparities.",R01 Upstream Approaches to Improve Late Life Care for People

"Evaluation of college accessibility and income security interventions as preventative measures for dementia risk and solutions to dementia disparities ABSTRACT. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) are leading causes of death in the United States that disproportionately impact individuals with less education and income. There is substantial evidence that ADRD is strongly patterned by socioeconomic status across the lifecourse. However, little prior work has evaluated whether socioeconomic interventions to increase socioeconomic status reduce the population burden of ADRD, or if there are differentially effects by sociodemographic subgroup, resulting in smaller disparities; this proposal addresses this critical gap in the literature. We evaluate socioeconomic interventions that increased years of education (Aim 1) and income security (Aim 2) to determine if such interventions impacted dementia risk overall, and whether structurally minoritized groups (Black Americans, individuals from low childhood SES backgrounds, and people who grew up in rural areas or the South) differentially benefited (Aim 3). We will use data from Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke cohort (REGARDS), and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort to evaluate these aims. Our research team has previously published using all three data sets. Aim 1 will evaluate whether expansion of college access reduced ADRD risk; hypothesis 1 evaluates college geographic accessibility via increases in 2 and 4-year higher education institutions per capita, while hypothesis 2 evaluates college financial accessibility via a large social intervention that subsidized college education (the Vietnam War GI Bill). Aim 2 will evaluate whether policies that increased income security reduced ADRD risk; hypothesis 1 evaluates the long-term effects of a working age poverty-alleviation policy (the earned income tax credit), while hypothesis 2 evaluates retirement income security (Social Security). Aim 3 will evaluate whether the education and income security interventions examined in Aims 1 and 2 reduced socioeconomic, racial, and geographic disparities in ADRD; differential effects will be evaluated using interaction terms, quantile regression, and distributional decomposition. If our hypotheses are confirmed, results from this research will provide direct evidence for solutions to reduce the future population burden of ADRD and disparities in ADRD. Our work can also inform targeting of interventions to those who benefit most. This research will provide immediately actionable evidence, because the interventions we evaluate are specific and feasible. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dementia is a leading cause of death in the United States, and disproportionately impacts individuals with less education and income. This proposal evaluates socioeconomic interventions that increased years of education (Aim 1) and income security (Aim 2) to determine if such interventions impacted dementia risk overall, and whether structurally minoritized groups (Black Americans, individuals from low childhood SES backgrounds, and people who grew up in rural areas or the South) differentially benefited (Aim 3). We hypothesize that these interventions reduced dementia risk overall, and that structurally minoritized groups benefitted more resulting in smaller socioeconomic, racial, and geographic disparities.",Evaluation of college accessibility and income security interventions as preventative measures for dementia risk and solutions to dementia disparities,10054598,R01AG069092,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Income Tax ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pensions ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Social Policies ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Veterans ', ' Vietnam ', ' Viet Nam ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Date of birth ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Security ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' alleviating poverty ', ' poverty alleviation ', ' social health determinants ', ' early life exposure ', ' health data ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' higher education ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' social vulnerability ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' social interventions ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,622373,0.04494354501633517
"A home-based, culturally and language specific intervention for dementia family caregivers: stress reduction and education with wearable technology for health ABSTRACT Over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's dementia, a disease with no effective treatment and no cure. Two-thirds of the caregivers for persons with dementia (PWD) are women (most often family) and a third are themselves over 65. Dementia takes a significant toll on caregivers, often resulting in chronic stress, depression, sleep disorders, poor health related quality of life (HRQOL), and early mortality due 24/7 care responsibility for PWD. Research has shown significant barriers to dementia care for underserved populations, including Latinos and Asian minorities. Underserved family caregivers for PWD tend to underutilize public health services available, and do not seek treatment until the situation is unmanageable with current resources reporting barriers that included language, time, and finances. Monitoring the caregiver's health and wellbeing is important as well as their maintaining a positive interaction with the PWD. Thus, there is a need for an innovative and feasible intervention to improve underserved caregiver's mental and physical health. Little research is reported for dementia caregiver interventions in underserved minorities and one given at home by community health workers (CHWs). The proposed intervention meets the needs of these family caregivers in developing a positive relationship with the PWD by educating caregivers to better understand the PWD's behaviors. Another component of the intervention is stress reduction techniques, including mindful deep breathing and compassionate support/listening to reduce depression and improve family relationships making the caregiving less burdensome. By monitoring the physiological responses of stress (i.e. heart rate variability), sleep and activity, we can objectively measure changes as a result of the intervention. Using Wearable Internet of Things (WIoT) technology, a combination of Watch/ring-Smartphone-Cloud, has proven to be a significant method of monitoring behavioral and physiological measures providing evidence of change over time and uniquely associated with this intervention. Our preliminary data show that the intervention with WIoT brought to the caregiver by CHW home visitors was acceptable to ethnic caregivers (Latino, Vietnamese, and Korean) and effective in reducing caregiver stress and burden over the short term. With the addition of non-Hispanic Whites, the proposed caregiver-centered, culturally and language appropriate, CHW home-visit-based 3-month intervention has 3 significant parts:1) stress reduction by mindful breathing and compassionate support/ listening to improve caregiver's health and well-being; 2) education on caregiving skills to improve responses to the PWD and in turn their behaviors; 3) WIoT physiological and behavioral monitoring. This 6-month randomized controlled trial will compare outcomes (burden, depression, HRQOL, PWD behaviors, caregiving self-efficacy) between the intervention, attention control with use of the WIoT only, and usual care groups at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. This intervention using the CHW-model and WIOT technology has the potential to lessen health disparities in dementia caregiving in ethnic and underserved family caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will test a 3-month, community health worker (CHW) delivered home visit, culturally and language-appropriate intervention for ethnic and underserved dementia family caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) using wearable technology for real time monitoring of caregivers' stress and sleep. The CHW delivered home visit intervention includes stress reduction techniques by mindful deep breathing and compassionate support/listening and caregiving education to improve caregiver's health, wellbeing, and positive interactions with the PWD. This dementia caregiver study using wearable technology has the potential to significantly lessen health disparities in dementia care, assisting underserved ethnic dementia caregivers in self-management and increasing their quality of life.","A home-based, culturally and language specific intervention for dementia family caregivers: stress reduction and education with wearable technology for health",10055352,R01AG069074,"['base ', ' improved ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Koreans ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' health related quality of life ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' caregiving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' care giving burden ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' mindfulness ', ' heart rate variability ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' attentional control ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care ', ' dementia caregiving ', ' underserved minority ', ' Internet of Things ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' stress reduction ', ' quality of sleep ', ' sleep quality ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' real time monitoring ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communication ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Language ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Morbidity -

"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care.

"Developing a Culturally-sensitive Volunteering Program to Reduce Stress of Dementia Caregivers in Chinese American Communities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Given the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States and the quickly growing population of older Chinese Americans, many older Chinese Americans are expected to need intensive care because of cognitive impairment. Few interventions have been designed to address caregiver needs among Chinese Americans, despite previous studies showing critical issues of poverty, low acculturation, and poor mental health in this population, the largest group of Asian Americans. A large gap exists in development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce stress among caregivers in Chinese American communities. This Research Career Development Award (K01) will give Dr. Liu the training, mentoring, and skills necessary to conduct intervention research to reduce the burden of dementia care among Chinese American families. The proposed mentored research activities for this K01 award involve developing and pilot testing a culturally sensitive intervention, the Peer Mentoring Program (PMP). Informed by the sociocultural stress and coping model, the PMP will build human resources among experiential Chinese caregivers to provide mentoring support for newer caregivers in the same ethnic community. This K01 application is responsive to NIA Research Goal E: “Improve our ability to reduce health disparities and eliminate health inequities among older adults.” It is also consistent with the National Alzheimer’s Project Act’s efforts to ensure receipt of culturally sensitive education, training, and support materials; involve more racially and ethnically diverse older adults in research; and develop effective services to support ethnically diverse families. To become an independent investigator in behavioral intervention research, Dr. Liu will receive training and mentoring in three areas: (a) knowledge of ADRD, interventions for caregivers, and dementia caregiving; (b) methodological skills to conduct community-based participatory research; and (c) theoretical and methodological skills to design and conduct scientifically rigorous intervention research. Mentored research training will occur in the context of a focused research project with three aims: (1) study the challenges and enablers of successful caregiving for persons with ADRD in the Chinese American communities of New York City; (2) develop a culturally sensitive volunteering intervention (PMP) to reduce stress and improve well-being of Chinese dementia caregivers; and (3) obtain preliminary data on feasibility and acceptability of the PMP. By the end of the K01 award, Dr. Liu will complete the transition from observational and explanatory to community-based intervention work and submit an R01 proposal and several manuscripts based on the study results for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The strong mentoring team, well-established collaborative relationships with community organizations in New York City, and marvelous academic resources at Columbia University will provide a supportive and enriching environment that will empower Dr. Liu to become a successful and independent investigator in behavioral intervention research.

"Carolina Center on Alzheimer's Disease and Minority Research (CCADMR) OVERALL SECTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Due to its tremendous human and financial burden, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have risen to the forefront of the United States (U.S.) public health agenda. Older African Americans are at an increased likelihood of having ADRD. South Carolina has the highest age-adjusted death rate from ADRD in the U.S. A better understanding of the role that sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental determinants have on ADRD outcomes among African-American communities in the Southeast is critically and immediately needed. The overall goal of the proposed Carolina Center on Alzheimer’s Disease and Minority Research (CCADMR) is to increase the diversity of the research workforce focused on population health and determinants of ADRD disparities through sustained infrastructure that will support underrepresented and minority (URM) faculty focused on the health and well-being of minority elders. The Specific Aims of the proposed AD-RCMAR are to: (1) increase the capacity of URM scholars to advance the science on the sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence ADRD outcomes in order to reduce ADRD-related disparities, with a focus on African Americans, and (2) advance the science of ADRD research focused on population health and determinants of ADRD disparities through research education in population-based, secondary data analysis, interdisciplinary co-mentoring teams, well-established strategies for recruitment of AD-RCMAR Scientists, and education on Health Disparities and Minority Aging Research. The proposed CCADMR is a state-wide collaboration, providing mentorship and education on determinants of ADRD disparities using population-based datasets for URM faculty throughout South Carolina, at the three major research institutions, including University of South Carolina (UofSC), Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), and Clemson University (CU), and three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including Allen University, Claflin University, and South Carolina State University. Interdisciplinary and partner-engaged research, with which the principal investigators (PIs) and research team have expertise, will be an effective strategy for addressing ADRD-related disparities. The proposed Center leverages the multiple PIs’ extensive leadership in providing critical training in aging and ADRD for URM Scientists and their research expertise in cognitive aging, minority health, and ADRD disparities. The PIs and Core Leads are well-established and collaborative scholars with substantial mentoring experience and content knowledge that will contribute to the success of the proposed CCADMR.

"Nevada Exploratory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (NVEADRC) NVEADRC OVERALL SUMMARY Health and healthcare disparities in rural vs. urban areas are recognized for several decades, and this is particularly true for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease related dementia (ADRD). Primary care physicians (PCPs) are rarely equipped with the skills and tools to diagnose the specific type of dementia their geriatric patients may be suffering. Because of possible long distances between rural areas and the nearest metropolitan area possessing expert dementia neurologists, some patients may never be diagnosed with dementia or may be misdiagnosed with the incorrect form of dementia. Previous Alzheimer Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) have explored rural risks and disparities for AD, but only as satellite programs rather than a major focus of their activities. Moreover, the literature on demented patients in rural areas is scarce and usually include only a small number of individuals with limited sets of biomedical data to be able to compare to datasets from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). Such gaps in healthcare offering and lack of reliable data on rural subjects is motivating us to create the Nevada Exploratory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (NVEADRC). Our new Center is based on previous strong collaborations between the Las Vegas Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health (LRBCH) and University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). In Aim 1, we will build the necessary infrastructure for the operations of our research enterprise. This includes the creation of novel methodologies and technologies to collect high-quality standardized clinical data in rural settings. In Aim 2, by utilizing the experience of our Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement Core we will foster our network of stakeholders, from government entities, to PCPs, down to rural patients themselves to make them feel that they own the NVEADRC project. In Aim 3, we will plan the transition from an exploratory stage to a full ADRC by demonstrating the feasibility of collecting longitudinal data from our rural cohort. By adding rural population information to the NACC set of data, our NVEADRC will provide novel resources that could be used by the broader AD/ADRD research community, which will significantly contribute to the overall mission of the ADRC network. NVEADRC OVERALL  NARRAT IVE With the present initiative, called the Nevada Exploratory Alzheimer’s Dementia Research Center (NVEADRC), we intend to build from the ground-up a novel Alzheimer’s Dementia Research Center (ADRC) with a thematic focus on disparities faced by rural dementia patients.

"Educational and Early Life Predictors of Mild Cognitive Impairment: New Evidence about Mediators and Moderators from High School & Beyond PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Education is among the most important predictors of cognitive functioning and cognitive impairment (including MCI and AD/ADRD). However, because scientists do not know how or why education matters for these cognitive outcomes, it is difficult to design effective interventions. There is currently very little information about (a) the specific aspects of education that prevent or provide resilience to cognitive impairment and (b) the pathways through which those effects operate. A major reason for this lack of information about how or why education matters for these cognitive outcomes is that data on educational opportunities, environments, and attainments have mainly been gathered via retrospective reports. To know how and why education matters for cognitive functioning and impairment, the scientific community needs high quality prospective studies that follow young people through schools and throughout adulthood, measures key and modifiable aspects of education, and then assess cognitive functioning later in life. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of leading neurologists, neuropsychologists, sociologists, education scientists, and survey methodologists who will design protocols to re-contact all ≈25,500 surviving members the High School & Beyond (HSB) cohort—a nationally representative random sample of Americans first interviewed in high school in 1980—and use the resulting data to conduct transformative analyses of the effects of education on cognitive function and risk for impairment at midlife. The project has five aims: (Aim 1) To estimate the effects of (a) adolescent cognitive and non-cognitive skills, (b) secondary school course taking and college field of study, and (c) other school structures and social environments on cognitive functioning and impairment at midlife; (Aim 2) To assess the degree to which racial/ethnic differences in those aspects of education explain racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive functioning and impairment; (Aim 3) To assess the degree to which the effects of education are mediated by educational attainment, economic strain, and the cognitive complexity of paid jobs at midlife; and (Aim 4) To assess the degree to which race/ethnicity and genetic risk factors moderate the effects of education on cognitive functioning and impairment. To gather the data required to pursue these Aims, the investigators will conduct an internet/phone survey and gather genetic material via a mail-back saliva kit. (Aim5) The resulting database and associated documentation and metadata will be made freely available to the research community to facilitate scholarship on the development of MCI, AD/ADRD, and cognitive decline. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will transform our understanding of the implications of education for cognitive functioning, cognitive impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) and cognitive aging later in life. Using a unique prospective longitudinal data source (High School and Beyond), it will allow us to answer questions about (a) whether social and educational disparities by race/ethnicity in adolescence shape racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment at midlife; (b) whether biological and social factors moderate the effects of education on cognitive functioning and impairment; and (c) the social and economic pathways through which those effects operate over the life course. Quantifying the magnitude of the effects of education on cognitive functioning and impairment will inform efforts to use educational and other interventions to improve the midlife cognitive functioning of future cohorts of Americans.",Educational and Early Life Predictors of Mild Cognitive Impairment: New Evidence about Mediators and Moderators from High School &

"Advance Care Planning in the Dementias: Culturally-Tailored Caregiver Education for African Americans African Americans face significantly greater risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and other dementias than white Americans but receive disproportionately less attention to dementia screening and support, resulting in a silent epidemic in this underserved population. Advance Care Treatment Plan (ACT-Plan) is a culturally-tailored caregiver education program for African American dementia caregivers with decisional responsibility that was previously evaluated in an R01 study. The program comprises four 1-hour group sessions of instruction with interactive exercises and homework. In a randomized controlled trial (R01AG043485), outcomes included significant improvements in caregiver knowledge and self-efficacy in advance care treatment decision-making for loved ones with dementia. While found effective, the above intervention was delivered in person by content experts, which is neither practical nor cost-effective for wide dissemination of this much-needed form of support. Thus alternative means of delivery are desirable. In African American communities many faith-based organizations maintain active health ministries, making them a natural resource with personnel that provide valuable service to members of their congregations and other community members. This FastTrack project will produce and evaluate a self-directed multimedia version of the ACT-Plan program, to be called “ACT-Plan(m)”, that can be facilitated by local, non-expert volunteers from health ministries of faith-based organizations, and others. If successful, this will enable wide dissemination of this form of caregiver education in African American communities. Phase I Aims: 1. Produce a prototype module of the ACT-Plan(m) program. 2. Conduct usability testing with three test groups using the prototype module. 3. Assess usability data and caregiver outcomes. Phase II Aims: 1. Produce all modules of the ACT-Plan(m) program. 2. Produce website for streaming and downloads of program materials. 3. Assess impact of ACT-Plan(m) on caregiver knowledge and self-efficacy in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize that caregivers receiving ACT-Plan(m) will attain significant improvements in knowledge and self-efficacy outcomes comparable to those of the original ACT-Plan program. Commercial product. ACT-Plan(m) will be a standardized, evidence-based caregiver education program for use by faith-based and secular health advocacy organizations serving the African American community, as well as private individuals. The program will be accessible online with video streaming and downloadable print materials, and in hard copy format (DVD, flash drive, and printed materials) for low-resource settings, portability, lending libraries, and users without web access. This new resource will empower community-based health advocacy organizations to better address dementia care in underserved African American communities. It will be the first evidence-based, culturally-tailored, self-directed multimedia dementia caregiver education program to aid African Americans in managing advance care planning and end of life decision-making. Public health benefits include reduced suffering and costs of end of life care for families and society.

"Examining the Role of Neighborhood Conditions, C-Reactive Protein, and Psychosocial Resiliency Factors in Cognitive Impairment among Diverse US Older Adults ABSTRACT Recent estimates indicate that African American and Hispanic older adults have higher rates of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD). In regards to AD/ADRD disparities by other social statuses, such as gender and socioeconomic status (SES), women and lower SES adults are at higher risk of cognitive decline than their male and high SES counterparts. While previous research has aimed to identify disparities in AD/ADRD, less is known about the underlying mechanisms that shape cognitive functioning trajectories among socially disadvantaged older adults in the US. Therefore, additional research is needed to disentangle the biopsychosocial pathways through which disparities in cognitive impairment may arise across race/ethnicity, gender, and SES groups. One determinant of AD/ADRD that may differentially contribute to cognitive decline, particularly for AA and Hispanic adults, is neighborhood context. Previous literature has documented adverse neighborhood conditions, including lack of cleanliness, safety, and social cohesion, are associated with worse health outcomes. Increased chronic stress among racial/ethnic minorities induced by long-term exposure to social inequality and race-based segregation policies is hypothesized to affect health via allostatic load. Resulting physiological dysregulation characterized by increased systemic inflammation has been associated with increased risk for chronic conditions; however, this mechanism has been less examined in regards to AD/ADRD development. Research examining if stressful neighborhood contexts of older adults are associated with cognitive impairment as well as if inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), modulate this relationship across racial/ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic groups will contribute to understanding of the biopsychosocial processes underlying AD/ADRD. Additionally, examination of resiliency factors that may be protective against cognitive decline, even among social disadvantaged adults, is needed to more fully understand variability in trajectories of AD/ADRD across groups. Thus, such findings will be important in addressing AD/ADRD disparities. The proposed research will utilize the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) which is a longitudinal, nationally representative dataset of non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican American US older adults to identify how perceived neighborhood conditions (i.e., safety, cleanliness, and social cohesion) are associated cognitive impairment across race/ethnicity, gender, and educational attainment (Aim 1). Moreover, the mediating role of CRP will be examined to further understand if inflammation may be a biological mechanism linking neighborhood-level stress to cognitive impairment development over time (Aim 2). Lastly, the moderating function of resiliency factors (i.e., perceived control, mastery, social support, and healthy behaviors) on the relationship between neighborhood perceptions and cognitive impairment will be assessed (Aim 3). As such, the proposed aims will contribute to increased understanding of the biopsychosocial mechanisms driving disparate rates of AD/ADRD for socially disadvantaged older adults. In order to address each research aim, an interdisciplinary team consisting of scientists trained in biobehavioral health, sociology/demography, and gerontology will be convened. The research team will integrate discipline- specific theoretical perspectives and analytical methodologies to provide a unique approach to identifying the multi-domain processes underlying AD/ADRD development. In particular, the research team will draw from their expertise in biobehavioral processes of aging, social inequality, cognitive functioning, and neighborhoods and health. Each researcher has extensive experience with the HRS and is skilled in advanced statistical analyses, particularly in multi-level and longitudinal methods, which will allow for examination of the complexity of cognitive impairment development across race/ethnicity, gender, and SES. As such, the proposed project is well- positioned to expand upon the dearth of knowledge regarding determinants of AD/ADRD disparities in US adults. Thus, clinical practice and health-related policies will be better able to improve upon current inequalities in AD/ADRD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a public health concern given the growing older adult population in the US. Racial/ethnic disparities in AD/ADRD have been documented such that African American and Hispanic older adults have greater risk for developing these conditions. However, less is understood about how factors such as neighborhood context and associated stressors may place racial/ethnic minorities on trajectories of more rapid cognitive decline compared to whites. Moreover, limited research has identified indicators of resilience that are protective against cognitive decline for African American and Mexican American older adults, who are the fastest growing segment of the Hispanic population in the US. Therefore, the proposed project will contribute to this research gap by examining the relationship between perceptions of neighborhood characteristics and risk of cognitive impairment over time as well as how this relationship varies across race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. By analyzing C-reactive protein as a biological mediator indicative of an inflammatory pathway linking stressful neighborhood conditions to cognitive impairment, this research will contribute to the dearth of knowledge regarding biopsychosocial determinants of cognitive impairment. Assessment of healthy behaviors, social support, and perceived mastery/control as resiliency factors that may decrease risk of cognitive impairment among African American and Mexican American older adults, while also considering the role of gender and education, contributes a unique approach to understanding AD/ADRD disparities. Taken together, the proposed research is important for addressing disparities because outcomes can inform development of interventions and policies that more specifically address the needs of those groups most burdened by AD/ADRD.","Examining the Role of Neighborhood Conditions, C-Reactive Protein, and Psychosocial Resiliency Factors in Cognitive Impairment among Diverse US Older

"Development of Therapeutics Targeting Tauopathy for Alzheimers Disease Project Summary The high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the African American (AA) population has been identified as an emerging health crisis by the Alzheimer's Association. While there is already a disproportionate percentage of African Americans with AD relative to the non-white Hispanic population (20% of all AD cases nationwide), this percentage is expected to increase to 42% of all cases nationwide by 2050. As such, there is an urgent need to address this current and growing health disparity. One of the key hallmarks of AD is tauopathy, the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in brain tissue. NFTs are aggregates of tau, a protein that normally binds to and stabilizes the microtubule network in neurons. The transition from tau's physiological association with the microtubule to the unbound form that leads to NFTs is due to the hyperphosphorylation of tau by a number of cellular kinases. Not only does tau hyperphosphorylation lead to the formation of NFTs, but its dissociation from microtubules leads to their destabilization, with resulting impacts on neuronal transport and organization. Preventing hyperphosphorylation of tau is thus a key target for the development of novel therapeutics for AD. Our project targets the inhibition of casein kinase 1 δ/ε that are known to phosphorylate the tau protein at residues involved in microtubule binding. Our laboratory has identified two classes of molecules that inhibit casein kinase 1δ/ε, blocking tau phosphorylation in cell-based assays. The goal of this proposal is to optimize these lead compounds to potential therapeutics with increased potency. Computational molecular modeling tools will be used to design new derivatives that will be synthesized using organic synthetic methods. To determine the efficacy of these new compounds in the inhibition of CK1δ/ε, we will test them in a reconstituted biochemical assay of tau phosphorylation using purified components. The end products of these assays will also be subjected to microtubule affinity assays to show that inhibiting CK1-dependent phosphorylation of tau maintains the physiologically relevant role of tau and blocks the pathological development of NFTs. The compounds developed through this process can serve as potential therapeutics for AD after further pre-clinical and clinical testing. This project will capitalize on the existing RCMI infrastructure that has been established at Xavier University of Louisiana, one of the nation's premier HBCUs for STEM education and research. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been deemed the silent epidemic for elderly African Americans by the Alzheimer's Association, as African Americans constitute a disproportionate 20% of the 5.5 million AD cases. The clinical hallmark of AD is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue. Our project is designed to develop therapeutics that would block the formation of these tangles.",Development of Therapeutics Targeting Tauopathy for Alzheimers Disease,10123832,U54MD007595,"['Affect

"Lifecourse exposure to community violence and risk of cognitive decline, Alzheimer's Disease, and related dementias among African-Americans PROJECT SUMMARY African-American populations are disproportionately impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Existing evidence suggests that a complex interplay of mechanisms contribute to elevated risk, including structural inequities in education, income, and community resources. What is not known is whether the undue burden of ADRD can be partly explained by exposure to community violence over the lifecourse. The current older adult population of African-Americans experienced an epidemic of violence and incarceration in their childhood to midlife years, with ongoing racial disparities even as violent crime overall has declined. Exposure to community violence is associated with multiple ADRD risk factors, including toxic stress, lower educational attainment, poor mental health, substance use, hypertension and obesity. Furthermore, African- American communities are subjected to structural violence, i.e. the extent to which community violence is sanctioned or created by racism in policies and programs. The overall objective of this study is to examine whether exposure to community and structural violence over the lifecourse is associated with cognitive function and ADRD among older African-Americans. The central hypothesis is that violence exposure at key developmental periods, e.g. childhood and adolescence, as well as lifetime cumulative exposure, lead to increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. The study will leverage two longitudinal cohorts, the Study of Healthy Aging in African-Americans (STAR) and the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE), which have data on social and behavioral measures, five decades of health records, and residential history of participants at several time points from birth until later life. We will use publicly available historical crime, incarceration and demographic data to address the following aims: 1) Examine associations between community and structural violence exposure at multiple time points, and cognitive decline and ADRD incidence; 2) Examine associations between violence exposure, and social, behavioral and health risk factors for cognitive decline and ADRD; and 3) Delineate the interplay between community and structural socioeconomic disadvantage, violence exposure, and cognitive decline and ADRD. We will conduct cross- sectional and longitudinal analyses of cognitive function, decline and ADRD incidence. African-Americans are disproportionately represented in the ADRD epidemic and yet very little is known about how community and structural violence may contribute to brain aging. It is critical from a public health standpoint to identify how policies affecting childhood and adult exposures can mitigate ADRD risk and cognitive decline in later life. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will leverage two unique longitudinal cohorts to examine relationships between exposure to community violence over the lifecourse, and risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s and related dementias among African-Americans. The findings will have a positive impact by identifying how social policies that affect African-American populations from childhood through adulthood can mitigate ADRD incidence in later life.","Lifecourse exposure to community violence and risk of cognitive decline, Alzheimer's Disease, and related dementias among African-Americans",9975637,R01AG067525,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Homicide ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Experience ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Policies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Network ', ' Chronic ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' health record ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' behavioral health ', ' ST-ADDR ', ' Street Address ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Population ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' healthy aging ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' violent crime ', ' health data ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' built environment ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,501699,0.07269219062261233
"DNA Methylation,Genetics, and Modifiable Risk Factors of Dementia in a Nationally Representative, Multi-Ethnic Cohort PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and its related dementias (ADRD) represent the leading terminal forms of dementia affecting a growing number of aging adults in the United States. Biomarkers of ADRD risk, particularly among susceptible populations (ADRD risk is disproportionately high among minorities, women, rural inhabitants, and people with lower education), represent a critical knowledge gap. Thus, studies with sufficient sample sizes, concurrently assessing multiple characteristics, such as educational attainment, environment, social, behavioral, lifestyle, geographic, biology, and epigenetics, will be uniquely positioned to effectively test factors or combinations of factors that create and sustain ADRD disparities. Our goal is to determine the joint epigenetic and environmental contributions to ADRD risk that underlie these health disparities. Using existing epigenetic and genetic data, well-characterized dementia phenotypes, and diverse risk factor data, we will analyze a population representative, multi-ethnic aging sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We aim to (1) test the associations between DNA methylation and dementia phenotypes (prevalent, 8-year incident), stratified by race/ethnicity and test for effect modification by ADRD disparity-related factors (educational attainment, sex, urban/rural); (2) identify associations between longitudinal measures of modifiable risk factors for ADRD and DNA methylation, stratified by race/ethnicity and test for effect modification or mediation by ADRD disparity-related factors; and finally, (3) identify genetic polymorphisms controlling DNA methylation and whether these are enriched in dementia outcomes to evaluate the role of DNA methylation in disease development. This study will likely impact the field of Alzheimer’s research and contribute to public health because it will a) establish the relevance of DNA methylation on ADRD in multiple race/ethnicities; b) elucidate important biological epigenetic mechanisms; c) determine the combined and individual epigenetic-environment interplay contributions to ADRD; and d) consider the effects of sex, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, younger age groups, and urban/rural status in the same study where comparisons of relative contribution to risk can be made. Here, we have the opportunity to simultaneously and substantially improve our understanding of the genetic and environmental etiologic contributions to health disparities in ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall purpose of this proposal is to identify modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias that influence DNA methylation and dementia status among groups at increased risk for dementia including women, minorities, rural inhabitants, and those with low educational attainment. Results from this proposal may provide an opportunity to identify epigenetic components that contribute to the prevalence and risk of dementia that could lead to a mechanistic understanding or targeted interventions that may substantially decrease the burden of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in the US population.","DNA Methylation,Genetics, and Modifiable Risk Factors of Dementia in a Nationally Representative, Multi-Ethnic Cohort",9970782,R01AG067592,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cognition ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Genome ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Memory ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' age group ', ' cohort ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' modifiable risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' demographics ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' methylation testing ', ' potential biological marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,703658,0.11884534712766251
"Characterizing disparities in late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk through polygenic risk and epidemiologic factors in the Health and Retirement Survey PROJECT SUMMARY Late-onset Alzheimer's dementia (LOAD) is terminal and the most prevalent form of dementia (70% of cases). LOAD is a major public health burden in the US with current prevalence estimates of 4 to 5 million adults and economic costs exceeding $236 billion annually. Important disparities in LOAD prevalence occur with sex, race/ethnicity, education, and residence. The biological bases of these health disparities are incompletely characterized and their influences on LOAD are likely to be multifactorial. Thus, studies with sufficient sample sizes, concurrently assessing multiple characteristics, such as educational attainment, environment, social, behavioral, lifestyle, geographic, and genetics, will be uniquely positioned to effectively test factors or combinations of factors that create and sustain LOAD disparities. Our goal is to determine the joint genetic and environmental contributions to LOAD risk that underlie these health disparities. Using existing genomics data, well-characterized dementia phenotypes, and diverse risk factor data, we will analyze up to 16,000 aging participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), attempt clinical confirmation in participants of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) sub-cohort of the HRS, and test replication in other clinical and population-based samples. Our aims are to (1) determine the cumulative genetic risk of LOAD by testing the association between cognitive polygenic scores and risk of dementia phenotype in European and African ancestries; (2) determine the polygenic effect of LOAD risk covariates from behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial domains on dementia phenotypes in European and African ancestries; and (3) test for effect modification of the association between polygenic risk and dementia phenotype in European and African ancestries by health disparities factors (sex, education, urban/rural residence). This study will likely impact the field of Alzheimer's research and contribute to public health because it will a) establish the relevance of cumulative genetic risk on LOAD in susceptible populations where genetics may be a more relevant factor; b) elucidate important biological mechanisms through polygenic scores; c) determine the combined and individual gene-environment contribution to LOAD risk; d) generate unified polygenic scores and dementia phenotypes across major longitudinal cohorts involving diverse populations that can be used in future investigations of health outcomes and/or additional exposure domains; e) consider the effects of sex, educational attainment, ancestry, and urban/rural status in the same study where comparisons of relative contribution to risk can be made. We have the opportunity to simultaneously and significantly improve our understanding of the genetic and environmental etiologic contributions to health disparities in LOAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall purpose of this proposal is to establish the relevance of polygenic risk in susceptibility to dementia, particularly among groups at increased risk of disease, including women, minorities, rural inhabitants, and those with low educational attainment. Because an individual's susceptibility to dementia is likely a combination of genetics and environmental risk factors, we will jointly test the effects of cumulative genetic risk and dementia risk factors in our analysis.

"Alzheimer's Disease Research Center SUMMARY Recent research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer’s Disease require biomarker evaluation (as with neuroimaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid) of brain β Amyloid plaques, Tau tangles, and Neurodegeneration (A/T/N), enabling detection of the presence (or absence) of AD neuropathology in living individuals, and allowing AD to be diagnosed and staged while intervention maybe be feasible. The proposed supplement seeks to acquire prospective PET and MRI data in accordance with the NIH-sponsored SCAN protocols to classify individuals using the A/T/N framework, specifically for minority participants in the Mount Sinai ADRC Clinical Cohort to enable examination of racial disparities in the prevalence of A/T/N biomarkers and their association with cognition and other factors. Acquisition of A/T/N profiles in minority cohorts are of particular significance because dementia of the Alzheimer’s type disproportionately impacts minority populations (particularly African American and Hispanic populations in the United States). Despite higher prevalence rates among minorities, they are less likely to receive a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or are more likely to be diagnosed later in the disease than their comparable non-minority counterparts. The proposed supplement seeks to help fill this gap by providing data on a minority that can be widely distributed among the Alzheimer’s disease research community. The cohort maintained by the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center is well-suited to examine racial disparities in imaging biomarkers given that over 40% of the cohort is comprised of minority participants. The supplement aims will: 1) establish the SCAN acquisition and data transfer protocols at our site and validate the on-site scanner, 2) acquire the SCAN protocol on a minority cohort of 40 participants at Mount Sinai sufficient to characterize individuals using the A/T/N framework, and 3) examine whether low prevalence of amyloidosis among memory-impaired minority participants can be explained by higher prevalence of tauopathy, neurodegeneration, or vascular burden. These aims have both practical and scientific significance and will result in data using the standardized SCAN protocol on an underserved population that can be widely shared and distributed to further Alzheimer’s disease research. Scientific significance will be achieved by comparing the data acquired through the supplement with non- minority participants characterized on SCAN-compatible protocols acquired with other resources to examine racial disparities in biomarker profiles. NARRATIVE Recent diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer’s require evidence, such as from neuroimaging, using a framework to measure brain βAmyloid plaques, Tau tangles, and Neurodegeneration (A/T/N). Minority participants are more likely to be diagnosed later in Alzheimer’s disease or to have an atypical A/T/N presentation, despite higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease among minorities. This proposal will acquire prospective neuroimaging data using standardized protocols to characterize minority individuals using the A/T/N framework and provide data will to a centralized resource for wide sharing among the research community, thereby permitting the examination of racial disparities in the prevalence of A/T/N biomarkers and their association with cognition and other

"Establishing the science behind Alzheimer's recruitment registries: opportunities for increasing diversity and accelerating enrollment into trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the singular focus on COVID-19 in both the media environment and in the everyday lives of most people, it is not clear how perceptions of other health conditions may shift, especially among older adults who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Research demonstrates a tendency for individuals to allow their attitudes towards one salient issue to impact their attitudes and behaviors towards unrelated, but similar other issues (i.e., spillover effects). Given the emphasis on science and research in COVID-19 discourse, it is important to assess whether older adults’ pandemic experiences may “spillover” to their perceptions of scientific research in ways that may affect their willingness to participate in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related research efforts. In this project, we propose to examine how information sources on COVID-19 and the larger context of the pandemic influence older adults’ perceptions of scientific research and AD, adherence to recommended COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and whether these perceptions vary by racial/ethnic group. This research is critical to determine whether COVID-19 spillover is changing how individuals perceive both AD as a health risk and calls to participate in AD research such as enrolling in recruitment registries. Grounded in Spreading Activation Theory and the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA), we propose two aims. First, to determine the extent to which COVID-19 news coverage and lived experiences change perceptions of scientific research and willingness to participate in AD-related research, we employ a mixed methods approach using surveys and content analysis. We conduct a series of repeated cross-sectional surveys over a period of 12 months to monitor how changes in the pandemic and in news coverage may be related to attitude shifts about research generally and specific to AD and AD risk. Survey data will be collected across 12 waves from a national sample stratified by the race groups that correspond to the groups of interest in the parent award (white, Hispanic, Black). Data are collected monthly, which allows for capturing perceptual shifts as the COVID-19 situation changes rapidly. A theory-driven content analysis of news coverage from main news sources, coinciding with the surveys, will also be conducted with the goal of understanding the extent and nature of COVID-19 information and misinformation, including topics such as racial disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and emphasis on older adults and racial minorities as vulnerable populations. The second aim identifies relevant psychosocial determinants (attitudes, norms, efficacy/control) of subsequent COVID-19- related health behaviors (i.e., preparation, prevention) for older adults using the RAA. We collect a follow-up wave of data (Wave 2) from the Wave 1/Baseline from the repeated cross-sectional surveys and predict how effects of exposure to media and interpersonal messages are mediated through attitudes, norms, and efficacy to predict subsequent COVID-19 recommended behaviors. Together these two aims allow for a test of COVID- 19 spillover into AD-related attitudes and willingness to participate in AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults’ perceptions of other health issues like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are unknown. Yet, AD-related research is dependent on older adults’ willingness to participate, especially underrepresented populations like African-Americans and Hispanics. This research is critical to determine whether attitudinal spillover from COVID-19 is changing how individuals perceive both AD as a health risk and calls to participate in AD research such as brain health recruitment registries.",Establishing the science behind Alzheimer's recruitment registries: opportunities for increasing diversity and accelerating enrollment into trials,10170070,R01AG063954,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hygiene ', ' Interest Group ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Distance ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' Misinformation ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Series ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' news ', ' Exposure to ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Children ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' AD prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' high risk ', ' Prevention trial ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Minority Enrollment ', ' social media ', ' brain health ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' racial minority ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' recruit ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIA,BANNER HEALTH,R01,2020,387949,0.016021789765391
"Health Beliefs, Glycemic Control, and Preventing Cognitive Decline in African Americans with Diabetes and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Clinical Trial Thirty percent of African Americans (AAs) with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have (DM), which increases risk for progression to dementia. Poorly controlled DM magnifies this risk, but whether improving glycemic control reduces the risk is uncertain. Previous studies have lacked rigor to resolve this uncertainty. The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies a high-risk population, which confers greater rigor. This single-site, double-blind, active-control, phase II RCT will compare the efficacy of DM-Specific Behavioral Activation (DM-BA) vs. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) to prevent decline in verbal memory (primary outcome) over 2 years in 200 AAs over age 65 years with amnestic multiple-domain MCI and poorly controlled DM. DM- BA is a behavioral treatment for DM, as well as a secondary prevention strategy for dementia. In DM-BA, race- concordant community health workers will: 1) deliver in-home DM education tailored to persons with MCI; 2) use action plans to reinforce DM self-care; 3) facilitate telehealth visits with a DM nurse educator to guide DM care and address participants’ health beliefs; and 4) increase primary care physicians’ (PCP) awareness of participants’ cognitive deficits and health beliefs to optimize treatment of DM. The control treatment, EUC, is usual medical care enhanced with DM self-care education. Both DM-BA and EUC deliver DM education and have the same number of in-home treatment visits (i.e., 6 visits over 6 months, and 5 booster visits over the next 18 months). EUC, however, does not include DM-BA’s behavioral approach to improve glycemic control, telehealth visits, or PCP communication. The treatment comparison will identify DM-BA’s specific efficacy over and above EUC. Participants will be recruited from primary care practices. We will administer the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) (to assess verbal memory; the primary outcome) and the Uniform Data Set neuropsychological battery (to assess executive function, processing speed, language, visuospatial function, and global cognition; all exploratory outcomes) at baseline and months 6, 12, 18, and 24. The primary efficacy analysis will compare trajectories in HVLT-R Total Recall scores over 2 years by treatment group. We will also explore whether APOE genotype moderates treatment effects, and whether Optical Coherence Tomography measures of retinal Vessel Area Density (a proxy for cerebral microvascular disease) and/or Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer thickness (a proxy for cerebral neurodegeneration) mediate treatment effects. This RCT is innovative because it will clarify whether improving glycemic control prevents cognitive decline in a high risk population and identify possible treatment mechanisms. This RCT is significant because it targets two major problems facing older AAs (i.e., poor glycemic control and dementia). AAs’ high risk for this comorbidity reflects the impact of cultural factors (e.g., health beliefs) and requires culturally relevant treatment. We have the experience and expertise to test this treatment, and the opportunity to change how DM is treated to prevent cognitive decline in AAs with MCI and DM and meet the goals of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act. This research aims to prevent cognitive decline in older African Americans with diabetes and Mild Cognitive Impairment. If successful, this research will preserve independence and health in an underserved population and reduce racial health disparities. These outcomes have major public health importance.","Health Beliefs, Glycemic Control, and Preventing Cognitive Decline in African Americans with Diabetes and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized

"Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive reserve refers to the ability to buffer against brain pathology, including types commonly found post mortem in the brains of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). I hypothesize that reserve is a key reason why some older adults have normal cognitive function despite the presence of neuropathology. Recently, researchers have begun to empirically investigate reserve as the discrepancy between neuropathology and brain function, as measured with cognitive tests. Studies have found a relationship between a disadvantaged early life environment and later life clinical dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. However, it is not known if an advantaged early life is related to greater later life reserve or lower levels of neuropathology itself. As brain development is particularly accelerated through age 5 years, early life could be a sensitive period for cognitive reserve. I propose to use four unique datasets that contain information on early life social environment, later life cognitive tests, and autopsy-based neuropathology measures from geographically diverse study populations: the Adult Changes in Thought Study, the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, the Religious Orders Study, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. I test the hypotheses that an advantaged early life environment, independently of and synergistically with adult social advantage, is related to greater later life cognitive reserve, even in the presence of significant neuropathology. I will be able to test also whether early life environment is related to actual levels of cognition and neuropathology. My background in demography and epidemiology, including 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow and 5 years as a junior faculty member, prepares me to lead these projects, under the guidance of a team that reflects the leadership of the proposed studies, local experts in neuropathology and epidemiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, a local expert in the analysis of cognitive measures, and a leading expert in the integration of social and life course epidemiology. The proposed training and research experiences in this project will be integral in building a foundation in the analysis of cognitive outcomes and resilience to dementia, and enhancing the experience of my existing skills in life course and aging epidemiology that will allow me to lead future projects at the intersection of these fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project identifies whether an advantaged early social environment increases one's later life cognitive reserve, that is, the ability to buffer from pathology. I measure an advantaged early social environment primarily through early life family socioeconomic position and height and also test to what extent an advantaged adult social environment explains this relationship, versus the link from early life to later life cognitive reserve.","Early life environment and later life dementia, cognition, neuropathology, and reserve",9956942,K01AG050723,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Asia ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Baltimore ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Buffers ', ' Clergy ', ' Cognition ', ' Demography ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Illinois ', ' Japanese American ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' Memory ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' tangle ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' nutritional care ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' Head circumference ', ' news ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' cored plaque ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Height ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social inequality ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' early life exposure ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' study population ', ' Lifecourse epidemiology ', ' Life course epidemiology ', ' preservation ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' religious order study ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,118910,0.11199385342020583
"Metabolomics of Neurocognitive Risk for Dementia in Diabetes Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major epidemic associated with significant burdens on patients, families, and the public healthcare system. Its rise in prevalence is concomitant with an increase in diabetes-related comorbidities. Among these, diabetes has emerged as a reproducible risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying the risk for dementia in the disproportionately burdened T2D populations are poorly understood. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that metabolomic signatures of neurocognitive trajectory are present in diabetes and these signatures explain, in part, race disparities in cognitive decline between European Americans and African Americans with T2D. This hypothesis will be explored by re-examining the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS) cohort for neurocognitive trajectory using a well-established cognitive battery, literacy testing, and adjudicated physician diagnosis of dementia. Because neurodegenerative conditions, representative of cognitive decline, are progressive with pathology developing years prior to the observation of clinical symptoms and functional deficits, untargeted metabolomic analysis will be performed on baseline samples collected >10 years prior and correlated with cognitive trajectory. This approach offers the potential to identify relevant biomarkers before onset of overt disease. Finally, a comprehensive genetic analysis of the DHS participants to examine the genetic architecture of neurocognitive measures and metabolomic signatures of neurocognitive change will be performed. The composition of this study, inclusive of European American and African Americans participants, will provide generalizability of the findings. The timing of this study is critical to contrast changes in midlife to early-late adulthood to identify first stage pathophysiological changes facilitating the identification of relevant biomarkers with potential to improve the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia.

"Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes Abstract African Americans (AAs) have a greater risk for poor cognitive aging compared to White Americans, whether measured as clinical dementia or as lower cognitive function in late life. Identification of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a key public health goal, given the rising number of older adults, the lack of effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies thus far, and the incredible emotional, psychological, and financial toll dementia exacts on patients and their families. Assessment of risk and resilience factors that may be particularly relevant to AA communities is of increasing public health significance. Research indicates that AA disparities in ADRD risk may emerge earlier in life; however, prior research on disparities in cognitive decline and ADRD have largely focused on adults after the age of 65. Therefore, assessment of modifiable risk factors for dementia in midlife AAs is imperative. At the same time, ambient air pollution is an emerging modifiable risk factor for dementia with wide opportunity for exposure over the life course. In particular, AAs are disproportionately exposed to air pollution compared to other groups, and such exposure is often coupled with neighborhood and economic deprivation, which can increase stress and heighten susceptibility to pollutant exposures. In response to NOT-CA-20-019, this administrative supplement proposes to add novel, spatially-refined longitudinal measures of air pollution exposure to our ongoing NCI- funded study (CA149105) that is following a cohort of mid- to late-life AAs residing in two low-income neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and to study the association between air pollution exposure and cognitive outcomes and ADRD risk. The parent study is focused on neighborhood change and dietary outcomes among residents over time, and a prior administrative supplement allowed for our team to add measures of cognitive function. This proposed supplement will allow for clinical adjudication of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia in a sample of participants from this cohort and build on the parent study’s (CA149105) rich existing data, which includes repeated measures of individual and contextual factors from 2011 through 2020. Aims of this proposal include: (1) quantifying the association between chronic exposure to air pollution and cognitive function and clinical cognitive outcomes (MCI and dementia); (2) examining the role of key individual-level factors (socioecoconomic status, perceived stress, body mass index) as potential modifiers in this association; (3) evaluating whether key neighborhood-level conditions (neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, residential and commercial investments) exacerbate or mitigate the association. The proposed supplement represents a unique and timely opportunity to expand the scope of the parent R01 to examine the relationship between air pollution and cognitive outcomes and ADRD risk in a sample of low-income, mid-life AA adults; a population burdened by multiple environmental and social stressors which collectively may contribute to disproportionate risk for cognitive decline and ADRD. Narrative African Americans (AAs) have a greater risk for poor cognitive aging compared to White Americans, whether measured as clinical dementia or as lower cognitive function in late life. At the same time, ambient air pollution is an emerging modifiable risk factor for dementia that is critically important because of the wide opportunity for exposure, particularly for AAs, over a lifetime. This supplemental study builds on almost ten years of longitudinal data among an aging cohort of low-income AAs to examine the relationship between air pollution and cognitive outcomes and dementia risk; a population burdened by multiple environmental and social stressors which collectively may contribute to disproportionate risk for cognitive decline and dementia.","Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes",10121837,R01CA149105,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Environmental Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' environmental stressor ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Prevention ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' technology implementation ', ' technology validation ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Coupled ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' PM0.1 ', ' ultrafine particulate matter ', ' ultrafine particle ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' built environment ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Infrastructure ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' perceived stress ', ' health goals ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,461671,0.0828278211655049
"Mechanisms of Cognitive Decline Across Socioeconomic and Clinical Contexts PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Inequality in health outcomes in relation to Americans’ socioeconomic position (SEP) is rising, despite recent evidence that the life expectancy gap between black and white Americans may be decreasing1. The disparity in life expectancy (given survival to age 50) between individuals in the top and bottom deciles of career earnings has nearly doubled over the last 20 years.2 Emerging research has indicated that these inequalities are also observed in studies of cognitive decline, with racial and ethnic minorities and persons of low socioeconomic status demonstrating earlier onset or more rapid cognitive decline in multiple studies. An analysis of the Health and Retirement Study has further found that neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP) and cardiovascular risk factors increase the odds of poor cognitive function among older adults. Our current NIA-funded study, “Modeling and Forecasting Atherosclerotic Risk: A Complex Systems Approach” (R01AG055480) is utilizing electronic health record (EHR) data in a first-of-its-kind regional, population-derived registry to understand how neighborhood social contexts influence cardiovascular risk across the life course. The NEOCARE Learning Health Registry includes data collected from 1999 to 2019 on more than 3.1 million unique individuals, diverse by race and ethnicity in Northeast Ohio. In this supplement we will implement a multifaceted, systems-based approach for jointly modeling risk of cognitive and cardiovascular disorders. Our work will evaluate the influence of neighborhood conditions on incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer’s and related dementias. We will also describe the relationship between hypertension and cognitive function across the socioeconomic spectrum, with a special focus on the mediating influence of antihypertensive therapies. Lastly, we aim to investigate and compare the influence of immuno-hematologic function, obesity and cardiovascular disease and SEP on cognitive function. The results of our study are expected to improve the effectiveness and delivery of primary care services by (i) promoting a deeper understanding about how short and long-term contextual factors involving patients’ social and physical environments lead to variation in Alzheimer’s disease onset and outcomes; and (ii) identifying and quantifying the importance of modifiable risk factors across heterogeneous populations that can be used to develop population-specific interventions to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s and dementia. This research is anticipated to yield new mechanistic insights, hypotheses for testing in future research applications, more accurate and representative models for predicting Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, and a basis for informing decisions at multiple strategic and programmatic levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current forecasts suggest that the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease will exceed 15 million individuals by the year 2050. In this supplemental project, we propose to begin to extend our innovations in modeling and predicting cardiovascular disease and outcomes to Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Our approach will work to understand, using a 3-million-person regional registry, how a wide array of factors (e.g. environmental, socioeconomic, cardiovascular) and therapies (e.g. antihypertensive treatment) combine to shape cognitive status and decline among older persons.",Mechanisms of Cognitive Decline Across Socioeconomic and Clinical Contexts,10120416,R01AG055480,"['Age ', ' ages ', '

"Arterial Stiffness and Brain Health in African Americans Cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are pressing public health concerns as the population ages. In the U.S., African Americans have a high risk of ADRD compared with other population groups; however, factors explaining this disparity are unknown. Greater central arterial stiffness is posited to alter microvasculature structure and function in the brain, contributing to cerebral small vessel disease, cognitive impairment, and risk of ADRD. No reports to date have examined these associations in a large, well-characterized African American population. Similarly, the salient roles of sex, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension in these associations have not been addressed, although African Americans have a high burden of cardiometabolic risk factors and hypertension that are associated with both greater arterial stiffness and risk of ADRD. We propose to examine these gaps in an ancillary study to the 2020-2022 Exam 4 of ~2,700 participants, ages 41-104 years, in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an ongoing and deeply phenotyped cohort of African Americans. We propose to add pulse wave velocity, a non-invasive arterial stiffness measurement, to all participants during Exam 4. All other data will be available from JHS and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS). To evaluate temporal change in arterial stiffness, we will leverage existing arterial stiffness measures from those who also participated in the ARIC-NCS Visit 5 (2011- 2013, N=1,078). The study aims are the following: Aim 1. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and the burden of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, subcortical infarcts, and markers of brain atrophy. Aim 2. Estimate the association of central arterial stiffness and domain-specific cognitive function. Aim 3. Characterize the 8-year change in central arterial stiffness and its association with the burden of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, subcortical infarcts, and brain volumes at Exam 4 among older adults in participants in both the ARIC-NCS and JHS studies. For all aims, we will evaluate sex, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension as potential effect modifiers. This cost-efficient ancillary study will, for the first time, contribute information on the association of central arterial stiffness and brain structure and function in a large sample of African Americans, a population exposed to high levels of hypertension and metabolic impairments and at risk for ADRD. The inclusion of middle-aged adults and measures of cerebral small vessel disease, cerebral infarcts, and impaired cognitive function will provide insights into opportunities for intervention prior to onset of cognitive impairment or overt ADRD. Understanding how arterial stiffness influences brain health will contribute novel information toward reducing health disparities and promoting cognitive resilience. This study is focused on the stiffening of the arteries and the associated structural damage to small vessels in the brain and reduced cognitive function that precede cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. We propose to add a measure of artery stiffness to the 2020-2022 re-examination of the Jackson Heart Study; information on risk factors, damage to small vessels in the brain and cognitive performance will come from the existing study and as well as measures of artery stiffness in subset of participants that also participated in the 2011-2013 visit of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities- Neurocognitive study. This study will provide new information on how stiffening of the arteries relate to brain structure and function in African Americans that can inform efforts to reduce health disparities and to identify potential targets to lower the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",Arterial Stiffness and Brain Health in African Americans,10081072,R01AG062488,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral Infarction ', ' cerebral infarct ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' insight ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' lacunar infarcts ', ' lacunar stroke ', ' Lacunar Infarctions ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' processing speed ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' artery stiffening ', ' artery stiffness ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' brain volume ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' resilience ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' high risk ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' brain health ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ', ' recruit ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,63558,0.14002587267173489
"Leveraging Existing Data and Analytic Methods for Health Disparities Research Related to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Abstract Two of a series of in-person workshops in 2020-2022 will be hosted at Duke to provide new knowledge on how existing and recently developed analytic methods can be used for detailed population and clinical data analysis in order to make progress in understanding the causes and mechanisms of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), related dementias (ADRD), and other prominent age-related diseases. The long- term goal of the series is to provide a resource focused on diffusing methodological know-how in terms of demonstrating the capabilities of newly developed methodologies, expanding on the rigor and range of application of well-established and familiar methods, promoting correct use of big health data both from a methodological and ethical prospective as well as providing a forum for experts and newcomers interested in health disparities and age-related diseases to discuss their ideas and promote their research. The pilot Duke- NIA workshop of the series held in February 2019 at Duke University was successful in drawing broad scientific interest to the topic and generated the background for the current proposal. The focus of the first workshop (planned in Winter 2020/2021) will be on demonstrating how studies using established administrative health data resources such as the Medicare claims database combined with innovative analytic approaches such as partitioning analyses, time-series based methods of projection/forecasting, and stochastic process models can be used to uncover previously overlooked and/or understudied aspects in this area of research. Specific topics to be discussed will include: i) disparities in risks and survival of AD/ADRD and other age- related diseases; ii) forecasting approaches for prevalence and mortality of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; iii) analysis of Medicare and other administrative claim-based data. The focus of the second workshop (planned in Winter 2021/2022) will extend this to include the health records data routinely collected in hospitals or University medical centers (e.g., the Duke Clinical Data Warehouse) and demonstrate how well- established and new analytic methods can be rigorously applied to such data to contribute to identifying the causes of persistent health disparities between specific groups of the U.S. population and narrowly defined patient strata. Specific topics will be expanded to include: i) analytic approaches to identify and quantify the contribution of treatment-related and medical care access-related factors to disparities in outcomes of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; ii) comorbidity, multimorbidity, treatment-related, social and genetic factors as sources of disparities in health outcomes of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; iii) forecasting of health outcomes and approaches for analyses of potential health interventions. The proceedings will be streamed live on the workshop website and presentations will be freely available in text and video form after the fact. Narrative Our objective is to host two in-person workshops in 2020-2021, in which research findings and evidence-based information and analytic tools for analyses of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease, related dementias and other prominent age-related diseases are discussed. Specific Aims to be addressed in this project will be focused on increased collaboration and partnership in an interdisciplinary research community focused on analytic methods for large-scale population and clinic-related data, constructing a bridge between independent research subgroups, and the identification of ways to achieve synergistic effects in multidisciplinary research by combining innovative approaches developed across different research groups.

"Building Relationships between Researchers and the Community to Increase African American Participation in Alzheimer's Disease Research Project Summary Abstract African Americans and other racial and ethnic minority groups remain underrepresented in aging research, despite increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). In light of the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of the aging population, the NIH has prioritized the recruitment and retention of individuals from marginalized populations in AD research programs, with the goal of increasing inclusivity of research participant pools, a critical aspect of effectively addressing future healthcare needs. Many studies indicate that African Americans are interested and willing to participate in research, but there are multiple complicating factors impeding full participation. The challenge for AD researchers is to develop research programs in which older African Americans are able to and feel comfortable participating. Successful programs address community-based and institutional barriers to recruitment, as well as prioritize increased collaboration, sensitivity, and responsiveness to the various cultural needs of participants from these groups. Previously, we designed a culturally-tailored service-based approach to improve the recruitment and retention of African Americans into the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). The long-term goal of this strategy is to increase engagement of African Americans in AD research by establishing a lasting community presence and positive, collaborative relationships through the provision of research-sponsored community programs. In the current proposal, using mixed methodology, we plan to 1) assess the impact of this strategy on overall attitudes towards research participation, and 2) conduct structured interviews to collect qualitative data identifying additional factors and key elements influencing research participation. Increasing the generalizability of findings through building more inclusive AD research participant pools is the first step in achieving the ultimate goal of eliminating health disparities and providing the highest level of care to all. Information gained will used to be used to refine the current program and support the establishment of other service-based recruitment and retention programs. Project Narrative The proposed study assesses research perceptions and the impact of a service-based model of recruitment on the participation of African Americans adults 45 and older.

"Contributions of educational quality and occupational complexity on racial and ethnic inequities in brain health and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia ABSTRACT By 2050 nearly 14 million people will suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the US and minorities will be disproportionally burdened. While it is known that certain racial/ethnic groups, such as African Americans, have higher rates of dementia, reasons for disparities are unknown. Though education and occupation are robustly associated with ADRD, research on education quality and occupational complexity has primarily included only Whites or, when examining racial/ethnic differences, focused on comparisons between Whites and African Americans. We propose to examine the role of educational quality and occupational complexity on cognitive decline, ADRD, and imaging markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration in a cohort with unparalleled racial/ethnic diversity. The proposed study derives measures of education quality and occupational complexity, building upon the following rich data sources at Kaiser Permanente Northern California: detailed social and physical measures from a Multiphasic Health Checkup completed during the 1960s to 1990s; electronic medical records from 1996 onward; and detailed social, cognitive, and neuroimaging measures from the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) study assessments. KHANDLE collects the names and locations of schools attended at 1st, 6th, 9th, and 12th grades as well as college or university attended which will be linked to historical indicators of school quality. Comprehensive information collected regarding occupation enables delineation of occupational complexity in early-, mid-, and late-adulthood. Utilizing these comprehensive data sources, we are in a unique position to successfully complete the aims of the study, which are to: 1) Evaluate the roles of education quality on cognitive decline, ADRD incidence, and imaging markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration in African American, White, Asian, and Latino individuals; 2) Examine the role of occupational complexity on cognitive decline, ADRD incidence, and imaging markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration in this diverse cohort; 3) Delineate if patterns of educational quality and occupational complexity across the lifecourse mediate racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD, cognitive decline, and imaging markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration. Utilizing a lifecourse approach, as recommended by the NIH State of the Science on Preventing Cognitive Decline, the proposed research will add vital information regarding the characteristics and timing of education quality and occupational complexity characteristics associated with ADRD and may inform future interventions aiming to improve cognition among elderly of all racial/ethnic groups. Given the marked disparities in ADRD rates by racial/ethnic groups there has never been a more critical time to understand how sociocontextual risk factors impact brain health in diverse populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Education quality and occupational complexity are known protective factors against Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), which are major public health problems that disproportionately burden several minority groups, yet the majority of research is conducted among primarily White populations or examines differences between Whites and African Americans. Including more racially diverse populations in research provides major opportunities for understanding the determinants of ADRD. The results of this project will further define our knowledge of education quality and occupational complexity as protective factors against cognitive decline and ADRD in a diverse cohort and assess their possible role as drivers of racial and ethnic inequalities in heathy brain aging.",Contributions of educational quality and occupational complexity on racial and ethnic inequities in brain

"Collaborative Approach for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Research and Education (CARE) in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias. Project Abstract/Summary of CARE Alzheimer's disease is the fourth leading cause of death in California compared to sixth in the U.S., and the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is expected to increase from 5.7 to 14 million by 2050. It is important to ensure that underserved communities, such as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), are engaged and educated on ADRD as disparities exist in knowledge about ADRD among AAPI and Asian American caregivers experience disparities in depression, burden, and physical health compared to non-Hispanic White caregivers even though AAPI are the most rapidly growing racial group of older Americans at risk for ADRD. Research participation from AAPI are limited and the sparse research suggests that AAPI are interested in being engaged, but that various concerns (e.g. lack of cultural/linguistic information and mistrust) need to be addressed in order to improve participation in ADRD research, including clinical trials participation. To overcome these barriers to ADRD clinical research participation, we will implement culturally appropriate and innovative recruitment strategies from a collaborative team of trusted sources of information (e.g. community partners). The ultimate goal of the proposed project, Collaborative Approach for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Research and Education (CARE) in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, is to address the gap and reduce disparities in ADRD research participation among AAPI through the creation of a registry of AAPI who are interested in participating in various types of ADRD research. CARE will be conducted in five languages (English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Korean) across four sites in California (San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento County, Los Angeles County, and Orange County). CARE is critical to ensure that AAPI, an underserved population, are meaningfully included in ADRD research. CARE will accomplish the following: a) Develop a registry that will facilitate future ADRD research with AAPI; b) Serve as a recruitment model for other populations; c) Increase the capacity of AD Centers/Institutes at and develop a new collaborative team across five universities; and, d) Develop a robust approach and add to the science of recruiting and retaining minorities in research with the overall goal of reducing ADRD disparities.

"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health. The tools proposed in this research may provide a low-cost, scalable method to improve detection of cognitive decline.",A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care

"Health and Aging Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE-AT(N)) Study PROJECT SUMMARY The 2018 NIA - Alzheimer's Association Research Framework [AT(N)] for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) provides a biological context for studying AD by incorporating state-of-the art biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N). Despite the fact that these biomarkers vary by race/ethnicity, no prior work has systematically examined them among Mexican Americans. Given that (1) Hispanic/Latinos are projected to experience the largest growth in AD and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRDs) by 2060 and (2) Mexican Americans are the largest segment of the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population, there is a pressing need to study prevalence, progression and clinical impact of these biomarkers among this underrepresented group. This work addresses goals of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), NIA Milestones for AD and ADRD research, and needs highlighted by the AT(N) framework publication. The current research team consists of leading experts in Mexican American cognitive aging, neuroimaging (PET and MRI), blood-based biomarkers as well as advanced statistical modeling. By leveraging the ongoing HABLE cohort, infrastructure and data, we will test the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine the prevalence, progression and clinical impact of cerebral markers of the 2018 AT(N) framework among community-dwelling Mexican Americans. Aim 2. Examine the prevalence, progression and clinical impact of blood markers of the 2018 AT(N) framework among community-dwelling Mexican Americans. Aim 3: To determine if blood-based biomarkers of Aβ40, Aβ42, tau and NfL can be used to screen for AT(N)-defined preclinical AD, prodromal AD and AD dementia for enrollment of Mexican Americans into novel clinical trials. The current study is highly significant for several reasons: (1) This is the first-ever large-scale multi-ethnic study of the AT(N) biomarkers, which is of tremendous importance given the racial/ethnic make-up of the U.S. population; (2) this work directly addresses goals set forth by NAPA as well NIA-Milestones for AD/ADRD science; (3) it will determine if ethnic-specific biomarker trajectories are appropriate and finally, (4) it will generate data and methods for increasing enrollment of Hispanics into clinical trials across the AT(N)-defined spectrum of AD (primary, secondary and tertiary prevention) beginning in primary care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The 2018 AT(N) Framework provides a biologically-based context for studying AD with recent work demonstrating that these core biomarkers vary by race/ethnicity. This study will examine both PET-based and blood-based biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N) at baseline and follow-up examinations. The information gained will (1) provide data to determine if the 2018 AT(N) Framework requires ethnic adjustments, (2) create a multi-tiered system that can be deployed in primary care settings to screen Mexican Americans with blood-based tools into novel trials and (3) provide methods and data to support ethnically-appropriate tailored novel clinical trials aimed at treating and preventing AD

"Lifecourse Stressors and Social Disparities in Cognitive Aging: The Roles of Social Networks and Sleep Disturbance Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately affect individuals from socially disadvantaged groups, but the role of lifespan psychosocial stressors in these disparities is uncertain. Social networks are hypothesized to be key sources of resilience against psychosocial stressors, but it is unknown if they moderate the adverse effects of stressors on ADRD risk or whether the buffering provided by social networks is consistent across diverse racial/ethnic groups. Sleep disturbance is a potential biobehavioral mechanism via which stressors may increase ADRD risk, but the mediating role of sleep has not been formally evaluated. Understanding the effects of psychosocial stressors and modifiable sources of resilience and biobehavioral mechanisms on ADRD risk will guide potential interventions to reduce ADRD disparities.  This proposal encompasses a training and research plan to develop the candidate’s expertise in ADRD research, preparing her to launch a career focused on reducing social inequalities in ADRD. The research proposal applies causal inference methods to elucidate the complex relationships between early social disadvantages, psychosocial and biobehavioral factors, and cognitive outcomes in older adulthood. The Specific Aims are to 1) quantify the association between cumulative stressors and cognitive function and determine how stressors explain social disparities in cognitive function (F99 dissertation research); and 2) determine the roles of social networks and sleep disturbances in the adverse effects of early-life stressors on ADRD risk across four racial/ethnic groups (K00 postdoctoral research). This research will use two large NIA-funded longitudinal cohorts:1) the Midlife Development in the United States Study (MIDUS) (F99); and 2) the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experience Study (KHANDLE), a life-course study linking risk factor data collected in mid-life (40-50 years ago) with contemporary assessments of risk factors, cognitive decline, and dementia in a sample of older non-Latino Whites, Blacks, Asians, and Latinos in California (K00).  This fellowship application aligns with the 2012 National Alzheimer’s Project Act priority to address social disparities in ADRD. The proposed project will generate new knowledge and provide crucial training for the candidate’s advancement to become an independent epidemiologist focused on ADRD disparities by developing expertise in 1) measurements and mechanisms of psychosocial stress (F99); 2) causal inference methods, including mediation modeling (F99/K00); 3) the epidemiology of ADRD and quantitative ADRD research methods, including longitudinal analyses and psychometrics (K00); 4) the physiology and psychology of sleep disturbances (K00); and 5) professional skills for an academic research career (K00). The advanced training, mentorship, and protected time provided by this award will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to lead the highest quality aging research and succeed as an independent investigator. This proposal outlines a training and research plan to determine the effects of psychosocial stressors on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), including the total effects, whether social networks buffer that effect, and whether sleep disturbance is a pathway from psychosocial stressors to ADRD.

"Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA) and COVID-19: Role of Pre-existing Neighborhood Characteristics and Cognitive Impairment Bateman et al., NOT-AG-20-022 2020 PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed administrative supplement will fund an investigation of the impact of COVID-19 on participants of the Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). We will determine the impact of COVID-19 related social distancing and stress on individuals with cognitive impairment as compared to older adults with normal cognition in the WF ADRC center cohort. The proposed supplement will be conducted in the Clinical Core cohort of the ADRC at Wake Forest School of Medicine, and falls within the general scope of the ADRC of identifying factors that modulate cognitive decline in aging and Alzheimer’s disease, and synergizes with our center’s focus on health disparities by utilizing a metric of neighborhood disadvantage. The proposal is based on evidence that loneliness and stress are associated with cognitive decline and are expected to be more prevalent as a result of social distancing public health measures for the prevention of COVID-19 spread. Several prior studies have shown that loneliness is associated with chronic stress in older adults, and that loneliness is further associated with cognitive decline, with some suggestion of a bidirectional relationship. Loneliness has been shown to be affected by neighborhood variables as well. Our proposed supplement will examine the impact of COVID-19 on loneliness and stress, and determine whether participants with pre- pandemic cognitive impairment, or those living in more deprived neighborhoods, are more vulnerable to the impact. There are two parts to our proposed study: a telephone-based questionnaire visit and dried blood spot collection for transcriptional analysis. We will collected two questionnaires focused on the impact of COVID-19, as well as questionnaires to assess perceived stress, loneliness, coping strategies, and psychological well- being. Each participant will be geocoded and their area deprivation index will be obtained based on publically- available data. A new collaborative relationship has been established with the UCLA Social Genomics Core which will perform the RNA extraction and analysis. 1 Bateman et al., NOT-AG-20-022 2020 PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will determine the impact of COVID-19 related social distancing and stress on Wake Forest ADRC clinical core participants by assessing impact on loneliness, psychological well-being, and coping strategies cross-sectionally. We will also be piloting the use of a dried blood spot collection technique in our cohort that will allow for less intrusive collection of peripheral blood to permit transcriptomic analysis remotely. We will accomplish this through developing a new collaborative relationship with the UCLA Social Genomics Core, a lab with extensive expertise in this technique. We will be examining the moderating role of pre-existing cognitive status and neighborhood deprivation on the above. Furthermore, this work sets the stage for future multi-site studies into the transcriptomics of stress as a feature of neighborhood deprivation and cognitive 1",Conserved Transcriptional Response to

"Understanding the mechanisms linking small vessel cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology with neurodegeneration and cognition during midlife PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this K99/R00 proposal is to elucidate the extent to which small vessel cerebrovascular disease (svCBVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology are additive or synergistic in their effects on neurodegeneration and cognition in midlife, and to determine if that differs across racial/ethnic groups. Comorbid svCBVD and AD pathology is observed in most dementia cases at autopsy, and is more prevalent in racial/ethnic minorities. Evidence is building that svCBVD has detrimental effects on amyloid clearance and tau phosphorylation, which exacerbates neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD. It is crucial to include svCBVD, amyloid, and tau when considering primary drivers of disease, and neurodegeneration and cognition when considering the consequences of those primary drivers. While initial cognitive impairments in svCBVD are in executive function and those in AD are in memory, the consequences of the two become less distinct when they co-occur. Equally as important, studies in midlife are necessary to elucidate how svCBVD and AD pathophysiology initially develop, and how a particular mixture of AD and svCBVD influences disease progression. Aim 1 (K99) determines the biological consequence that svCBVD and amyloid have on tau- related neurodegeneration, and explores racial/ethnic differences in these associations. Aim 2 (K99) determines the cognitive consequence that svCBVD and amyloid have on tau-related memory dysfunction, and explores racial/ethnic differences in these associations. The central hypothesis is that, in middle age, individuals with svCBVD demonstrate more AD-related neurodegeneration and subsequently more cognitive impairment, and that this effect will be stronger in racial/ethnic minorities due to the higher prevalence of svCBVD. To achieve these goals, the applicant will undergo quick, but essential mentored training in three areas: (1) tau and small vessel cerebrovascular disease, (2) applied neuroscience, and (3) advanced statistical modeling. With these skills, the applicant will be well equipped to independently pursue Aim 3 (R00), which determines the longitudinal consequences that baseline svCBVD and amyloid have on neurodegeneration and memory decline over time. Understanding the consequences of single or mixed svCBVD and AD pathology will inform therapeutic targets and help determine whether interventional strategies need to differ by race/ethnicity. The strengths of this proposal include formal training in the underlying pathology represented by biomarkers and its connection to cognition, as well as formal training in statistics to rigorously implement a flexible National Institute on Aging(NIA)-Alzheimer’s Association-recommended research framework to directly address the current missions of the NIA. For the applicant, this accelerated training period will facilitate the development of an independent research program focused on large-scale neuroimaging studies of AD and related dementias in diverse populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Pathway to Independence Award, the applicant will use advanced multimodal neuroimaging and statistical techniques to elucidate the extent to which small vessel cerebrovascular disease (svCBVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology are additive or synergistic in their effects on neurodegeneration and cognition in a community-based, middle-aged, multiethnic cohort. Specifically, the contribution of svCBVD pathophysiology, through its effect on amyloid clearance and tau phosphorylation, to AD-related neurodegeneration and memory impairment in midlife will be compared across racial/ethnic groups. Outcomes from this proposal will provide key information about the mechanisms by which svCBVD and AD pathophysiology interact at the earliest stage of their development to affect neurodegeneration and cognition that informs clinical trials on the relevant target(s) in dementia with mixed pathology that can be generalized to racially/ethnically diverse populations.",Understanding the mechanisms

"Dementia epidemiology, health service utilization and treatment costs among American Indian and Alaska Native Elders PROJECT SUMMARY  As the US population ages, the number of people living with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is projected to triple by 2050. Although the life expectancy of American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) is much shorter than that of other US populations, it has dramatically increased in the last few decades, with the expansion of the AI/AN elder population expected to continue. Compared to most US populations, AI/ANs bear a disproportionate burden of many established modifiable risk factors for dementia, such as diabetes, obesity, and smoking. However, our knowledge about dementia in this population remains to be severely limited. So far, only a handful of studies have examined dementia among AI/ANs, with reliable data on the prevalence or incidence of dementia in this population being nonexistent. Given so many gaps in our knowledge about dementia among AI/ANs, a systematic investigation is urgently needed to identify how problematic dementia is in this population and its impact on the Indian health system to enable more precise planning and prioritization of resources needed to support relevant health care policy. Here, leveraging on 16 years of longitudinal data available in the Indian Health Service (IHS) Data Project, a synthesis of existing IHS electronic health data for nearly 30% of the IHS service population (~ 640,000 AI/ANs), we propose to address 4 major knowledge gaps about dementia among AI/ANs as guided by the following specific aims: (1) Estimate dementia prevalence, incidence, and comorbidity rates among AI/AN elders by individual and community characteristics, such as age, gender, location, and county level socioeconomic status; (2) Characterize the association between dementia and potentially modifiable risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, binge drinking, traumatic brain injuries and depression; (3) Evaluate the influence of dementia and comorbidity status on health service utilization patterns, including inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy services; and (4) Examine the costs of providing treatment among AI/ANs with dementia, and factors that influence these costs such as comorbidity status. Our proposed analyses will provide a relatively accurate and complete picture for the epidemiology of diagnosed dementia among AI/ANs based on a large and geographically diverse sample, and contribute to the understanding of dementia and associated health service utilization in an extremely underserved population living in disadvantaged communities. Our findings promise to lay groundwork for future studies on dementia to address both the needs of AI/ANs and those of other similarly underserved populations.

"The Importance of the Neighborhood Environment in Determining Health and Well-being among Persons with Dementia and their Caregivers PROJECT SUMMARY The rapid increase in the population with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the United States constitutes a looming public health crisis. Dementia is a syndrome of progressive cognitive impairment and a leading cause of disability, loss of independence, institutionalization, and death in older adults. ADRD affect more than 5 million U.S. adults over age 65, but also impact an estimated 16 million family and friends who, as primary caregivers, are at increased risk of poor physical and mental health and social isolation. The prevalence of dementia is expected to increase as the population ages, and there is currently no known treatment that can cure or substantially slow its progression. A top public health priority, therefore, is to determine how to improve the lives of persons living with dementia (PWD) in order reduce the impact of dementia on PWD and their caregivers. Features of the neighborhood social, physical, built, and service environment may provide necessary support to PWD and their caregivers, or, alternatively, exacerbate the adverse impacts of dementia. The proposed study will determine how neighborhood-based supportive factors (e.g., meal delivery, home health care, amenities, walkability) and stressors (e.g., lack of safety, disorder, noise, traffic) affect health and well- being among PWD and their caregivers. We leverage data from two large, nationally representative, and longitudinal surveys that have collected information on thousands of PWD and their caregivers and provide information on their place of residence: the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). We will first create a national, longitudinal database of neighborhood characteristics that, as indicated by theory and research, reflect opportunities for physical activity, social engagement, and mental stimulation, supportive services and resources, and psychosocial stressors. Using this new data resource, which will be made available to the research community, we will estimate the impact of neighborhood-level factors on multiple dimensions of health and well-being (e.g., frailty, social engagement, institutionalization) for both PWD and their caregivers. We will further determine if health and well-being vary across groups defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, living alone, and residence in urban/rural areas and assess the role of the neighborhood in generating this inequality. To our knowledge, this will be the first empirical study to examine, in a national context, how neighborhoods can engender quality of life in PWD and their caregivers. The proposed study is timely because an increasing number of cities and communities are engaged in efforts to become more dementia-friendly. This project will identify aspects of neighborhoods and communities that support living well with dementia and inform policies and programs to reduce the costs and burden of dementia on individuals, families, and communities.

"The Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research The Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health of the Johns Hopkins University are proposing a new Alzheimer's-related Resources Center for Minority Aging Research (AD- RCMAR) in response to RFA-AG-18-002. The aims of this application are to: (1) mentor early- stage investigators from underrepresented backgrounds in minority aging and health disparities research, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD), using a life course perspective encompassing biological, behavioral, and community factors contributing to cognitive impairment and dementia in older minority adults; (2) conduct epidemiological, preventive, and intervention research that addresses ADRD in later life within a multi-level framework that encompasses individuals, families, social networks, and communities; and 3) engage communities and health care providers – especially family caregivers, primary care practices, communities of faith, and community organizations – as our partners in recognizing dementia and developing interventions with the potential to prevent cognitive decline and reduce ADRD dementia risk and disparities in minority older adults. The Johns Hopkins AD- RCMAR consists of: (1) an Administrative Core whose function is to provide governance and an administrative structure, to support research, to foster interactions between Cores and other Centers, and to ensure RCMAR Scientists develop mentoring relationships across the affiliated departments, schools, the intramural program at NIA in Baltimore, and nationally; (2) a Research Education Component to foster diverse junior investigators and mid-career investigators transitioning into ADRD-relevant research through support for individual pilot projects, career mentoring, scholar-to-scholar interactions, and role modeling; (3) a Community- Liaison and Recruitment Core to ensure the relevance of the ADRD research and to increase knowledge of engagement of community members in the research enterprise with the creation of a Community Resource Institute as a venue for community-investigator interaction; and (4) an Analysis Core as a foundation for methodological and statistical mentoring, including education and mentoring in mixed-methods research. An Executive Committee includes community representatives and a Scientific Advisory Panel consists of distinguished investigators with relevant expertise in minority aging, disparities, and ADRD. A pilot project program supported by all Cores to facilitate the development of RCMAR Scientists includes three initial pilot projects focusing on recruitment of minority populations for ADRD research, early diagnoses of dementia, and intervention development related to ADRD-related driving disparities. The burden of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) falls disproportionately on the minority older population. Research on minority aging to understand racial/ethnic disparities in ADRD and to develop interventions and preventive strategies to reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk is urgently needed. A goal of this application is to train and support early- stage investigators from underrepresented backgrounds who are carrying out ADRD-relevant research that supports cognitive health and well being in minority older adults.",The Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging Research,9986583,P30AG059298,"['well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Social Network ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Detection ', ' Intramural Program ', ' Intramural Research Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' investigator training ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' older driver ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' peer-group environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' recruit ', ' service delivery ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,1331480,0.06767835922567328
"A Multidomain Approach to Preventing Dementia in African Americans: Cognitive Prescriptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT African Americans (AAs) are twice as likely to develop dementia than Whites, and evidence suggests that modifiable lifestyle factors account for much of this disparity. AAs also demonstrate poorer dementia knowledge than Whites. Yet, virtually no multi-domain dementia prevention interventions have targeted AAs. Lifespan approaches implementing behavioral therapies before manifestation of impairment may be particularly advantageous, as dementia pathology may precede symptoms by over 20 years. The current study will be the first to explore the feasibility and efficacy of an individualized approach dubbed Cognitive Prescriptions (CogRx) in middle-aged AAs. This approach targets five lifestyle areas: Physical Activity, Cognitive Activity, Diet, Sleep, and Social Activity. Deficiencies in these domains have been demonstrated observationally as behavioral risk factors for dementia. These malleable domains may be especially viable intervention targets, and may have positive secondary outcomes. At 3 and 6 months we will examine primary (i.e., lifestyle changes and dementia knowledge) and secondary (i.e., cognitive function and psychological function) outcomes across three groups: no-contact control, psychoeducation only, and psychoeducation + CogRx. The psychoeducation will target general dementia knowledge, including prevalence, prognosis, and general risk factor information, while the CogRx group will receive a tailored risk/protective factor profile across the five aforementioned domains while also addressing barriers to these areas. The CogRx condition will develop a tailored plan prioritizing deficient domains and integrate activities in their daily lives over the following 3-months. The CogRx condition will receive daily text-messaging reminders and adherence queries over the 3-months and will provide qualitative feedback for future implementation of this program at the 3- month follow-up. The current study will overcome limitations of prior multi-domain cognitive interventions by: 1) enrolling middle-aged adults with a focus on prevention, 2) examining a broad range of lifestyle domains, 3) using self-initiated “prescriptions” for behavioral changes rather than structured lab-based interventions or supplements/medications, 4) assessing adherence and self-efficacy, 5) tailoring the intervention to deficient areas, 6) examining psychological/mental health outcomes, 7) examining dementia knowledge. The theoretical underpinnings for this approach include the Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model, in that providing tailored risk factor information (i.e., susceptibility), concrete goals, and outcome expectations while also addressing self-efficacy and barriers will promote behavior change. The ultimate goal of this research is to: 1) yield new perspectives for implementation of person-centered behavioral modification interventions targeting cognitive outcomes in diverse populations, 2) impact clinical and public health recommendations for maintaining cognitive health in aging populations, and 3) reduce racial disparities in dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the increased risk for dementia in African Americans, the significant evidence on the role health behaviors may play in this risk, and evidence of less dementia knowledge in this group, virtually no studies have targeted this population in behavioral modification cognitive interventions. The current study will test the feasibility and initial efficacy of individualized cognitive prescriptions (CogRx) in middle-aged African Americans that combines dementia knowledge psychoeducation with a tailored risk and protective factor profile based on five lifestyle domains. The ultimate goal of this research is to: 1) yield new perspectives for implementation of person-centered behavioral modification interventions targeting cognitive outcomes in diverse populations, 2)

"Life Course Process of Alzheimer's Disease: Sex Difference and Biosocial Mechanisms Abstract The proposed research addresses two fundamental problems in population research on the Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) sex disparities in cognitive decline with aging, and (2) interplay of social and biological pathways that generate and sustain AD disparities. Our proposal breaks new ground with an innovative life- course research design that conjoins prospective cohort data from five large-scale NIH population-based longitudinal studies that collectively cover the adult life span. We will conduct integrative data analysis in response to an increased demand for replicability of scientific findings across independent studies and make efficient use of extant resources in the pursuit of a cumulative science. We will apply novel statistical methods to model longitudinal sex differences in age trajectories of cognitive functioning from young to late adulthood and incidence of AD in old age. We will examine social and biological mechanisms influencing cognitive trajectories and sex differences. Tested mechanisms will include social stress related to socioeconomic status (SES) and social relationships, and biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic, neuroendocrine, and immune pathways implicated in AD. We will also test and integrate new biological data on immune function. Project Narrative The proposed project will examine the process of age change in cognitive function in relation to risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) throughout the adult life span and how such process is different for men and women. It seeks to better understand how social disadvantages such as low socioeconomic status and social isolation “get under the skin” to influence biological pathways to cognitive health as individuals age. It contributes new knowledge that is critical for identifying the life stages in which intervention might be most effective, targeting AD prevention and treatment in men and women, and informing efforts to contain AD related healthcare costs in America.",Life Course Process of Alzheimer's Disease: Sex Difference and Biosocial Mechanisms,9956958,R01AG057800,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old

"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,9952648,K99AG066949,"['Accounting ', '

"The neurodevelopmental mechanisms linking  environmental experience and executive function PROJECT SUMMARY Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with executive function (EF) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) development. However, understanding of the specific aspects of SES that influence development of EF and the PFC remains limited. EF in early childhood is associated with initial school readiness, academic success, and a wide range of outcomes in adulthood. Determining how early environmental experiences shape EF development is critical to identify strategies to support the development of these skills to promote healthy outcomes across the life span. Accelerated progress in this effort can be made only when intervention development is informed by a principled and biologically plausible understanding of the developmental mechanisms by which environmental experience shapes the development of the PFC and associated EF. This proposal argues that cognitive stimulation that occurs in the context of caregiver interactions supports development of connectivity between the ventral visual stream (VVS) and the PFC, which lays the groundwork for the complex computations necessary for EF. The proposal will test both environmental (cognitive stimulation) and neurodevelopmental (VVS-PFC connectivity) mechanisms explaining SES-related differences in EF and academic achievement. Study 1 (K99 phase) uses innovative observational methods to assess the home environment of school-attending children aged 6-7 years, cognitive and academic assessments, and functional and structural MRI to examine whether cognitive stimulation is an environmental mechanism explaining SES-related differences in EF (Aim 1). Study 1 will also evaluate whether early cognitive stimulation mediates SES-related differences in structure, function, and connectivity between the VVS and PFC (Aim 2). Study 2 (R00 phase) is a longitudinal study of children 4-5 years (Time 1) followed as they make the important transition to school (Time 2). This study will evaluate whether structure and function of the VVS early in development precedes and predicts structure and function of the PFC (Aim 3) using multimodal neuroimaging techniques (functional near infrared spectroscopy, functional and structural MRI). Finally, Study 2 will test whether cognitive stimulation explains SES-related differences in VVS and PFC structure and function and individual differences in EF, and evaluate whether these pathways ultimately explain disparities in academic achievement (Aim 4). The results of these studies will provide insight into the environmental and neural mechanisms explaining SES-related differences in EF and academic achievement. These studies have the potential to inform interventions to help close the income-achievement gap. This award will provide the candidate, who has a strong background in cognitive neuroscience in adults, with training in developmental methods and developmental cognitive neuroscience to facilitate her transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with differences in cognitive and academic outcomes with children from disadvantaged backgrounds performing worse than their more advantaged counterparts. The proposed studies investigate environmental and neurodevelopmental mechanisms explaining SES-related differences in executive function, with a focus on how early cognitive stimulation shapes coordination between the ventral visual stream and prefrontal cortex in young children. Study findings have the potential to inform interventions to improve cognitive and academic outcomes for children.!",The neurodevelopmental mechanisms linking  environmental experience and executive function,9977451,K99HD099203,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Books ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Gold ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Learning ', ' Life Experience ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toy ', ' Work ', ' Child Support ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' conflict resolution ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Categories ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' environment enrichment ', ' environment enrichment for laboratory animals ', ' environmental enrichment ', ' environmental enrichment for laboratory animals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' effective intervention ', ' cognitive development ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,128007,0.08114552446181073
"Culture-Gene Relationship:  A Novel Model of Aging Cognitive Health Abstract  To reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), scientists and policy makers have called for new models of the disease. The proposed project tests a novel model of how culture and genes may interact to influence AD and cognitive health. This project will provide the first investigation of whether a modifiable, culture-based environmental factor, negative age beliefs, exacerbates the effect of the genetic-risk-factor apolipoprotein E4 (APOE ε4) on adverse cognitive outcomes, including risk for AD, and whether positive age beliefs increase the likelihood that APOE ε2 leads to beneficial cognitive outcomes, including reduced AD risk. The proposed project builds on our findings with older individuals that (a) negative age beliefs can lead to greater stress, worse cognitive outcomes, and a greater accumulation of AD biomarkers; and (b) positive age beliefs can protect against these outcomes. This project also builds on the finding that APOE ε4 and ε2 account for less than half of aging-cognition variance; age beliefs may help to explain the remaining variance. Our proposed project with older persons will examine four specific aims for the first time: Aim 1. To examine whether the APOE genotype moderates age beliefs' impact on cognitive outcomes. We predict: (a) APOE ε4 carriers will show a greater detrimental impact of negative age beliefs on cognitive outcomes, compared to non-APOE ε4 carriers; and (b) APOE ε2 carriers will show a greater beneficial impact of positive age beliefs on cognitive outcomes, compared to non-APOE ε2 carriers. Aim 2. To examine whether our age belief-APOE genotype model helps to explain disparities by race and sex on cognitive outcomes. Considering that members of marginalized groups may be more sensitive to age stereotypes, we predict: (a) African Americans will show a stronger additive influence of APOE ε4 and negative age beliefs on detrimental cognitive outcomes, as well as a stronger additive influence of APOE ε2 and positive age beliefs on beneficial cognitive outcome, compared to Whites; and (b) women, compared to men, will show the same pattern as older African Americans described in Aim 2a. Aim 3. To examine whether psychosocial factors, related to age beliefs, influence Aim 1 patterns. We predict: (a) those higher in vulnerability factors (e.g., perceived discrimination) will show a stronger additive influence of APOE ε4 and negative age beliefs on detrimental cognitive outcomes, as well as a weaker additive influence of APOE ε2 and positive age beliefs on beneficial cognitive outcomes; and (b) those higher in resiliency factors (e.g., feeling useful to others) will show the reverse pattern. Aim 4. To examine whether psychological and behavioral mechanisms link the age belief-genotype predictor to cognitive outcomes. We predict: stress and physical activity will act as mediators of this association.  This proposed project will draw on three longitudinal datasets with common key variables. This study meets the NIA priority to identify factors that could help explain disparities in AD risk by race and sex. Narrative  The proposed project presents and tests a new model of how culture and genes may interact to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive health. Since the cultural factor, age beliefs, can be modified, this project could lead to developing interventions that reduce the risk of AD.",Culture-Gene Relationship:  A Novel Model of Aging Cognitive Health,9970376,U01AG032284,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' Cognition ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' Woman ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' APOE e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' Measures ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' tangle ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' cored plaque ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' ']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,418750,0.11699699950311143
"Reducing African Americans' Alzheimer's Disease Risk Through Exercise-MCI Cohort (RAATE-MCI) Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease is steadily increasing in prevalence, with a devastating public health impact. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease is higher in African Americans compared to white Americans, thereby constituting a health disparity. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk for progressing to dementia, including AD dementia. Interventions that prevent Alzheimer’s disease or change the course of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s disease are needed. Most older adults do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity, and this includes African Americans. Regular physical activity has proven to be a safe and effective means to enhance cognitive function in older adults with MCI. Therefore, our study is focused on physical activity promotion, a potent approach to modifying multiple neurobiological pathways implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease. We evaluate exercise benefits among elderly African Americans, who are understudied and in whom the natural course of neurodegeneration, exercise effects on neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, and resulting clinical phenotypes may differ. A large body of existing data suggests that exercise improves cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, and thus has the potential to enhance perivascular clearance of amyloid and reduce chronic brain tissue ischemia, among other beneficial effects. At the same time, chronic exercise has been shown to increase central levels of neurotrophic factors, which in turn promote protection against Alzheimer’s Disease neurodegeneration pathways via a variety of mechanisms. While physical activity interventions have been shown to have positive effects on these factors and on resultant cognitive functioning in older adults, nearly all interventions have had a negligible representation of African Americans. Prior data suggests that African Americans enter their elderly years against a backdrop of different lifespan exposures to a variety of factors relevant to neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, including cardiovascular risk, exercise, diet, and education. In addition, prior data suggests that the key genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease (APOE) may have differing consequences for Alzheimer’s Disease risk among African Americans, and other genetic differences (i.e. leucocyte telomere length) have the potential to influence the brain benefits of physical activity in this community. We will utilize a randomized clinical trial to addresses these questions. Participants will be randomized into a physical activity promotion intervention or an active control group for 52 weeks. We will recruit a population with MCI. We will assess cognitive function, brain structure and function, circulating hormones, neurotrophic factors, objectively measured physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, sleep parameters, and telomere length. Our study will take the first step toward understanding whether the hypothesized benefits of exercise for the brain carry over to elderly African Americans with MCI. Narrative African American adults have two times the risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease compared to other ethnic groups. Regular physical activity is promising for reducing risk of Alzheimer’s Disease, but there is very little data on this question in African Americans. The current study (called “RAATE-MCI”) will determine if regular physical activity conducted over a year will reduce risk factors for developing Alzheimer’s Disease in older African American adults with mild cognitive impairment. We will assess participant’s brain functioning, brain structure, memory, chromosomes, and the contribution of plaques in the brain on outcomes.",Reducing African Americans' Alzheimer's Disease Risk
